* **Page breaks** are indicated inline as *[edition:volume:page]*.
* **Footnotes** and marginal notes are included inline at the point of the siglum, as *^[1. This is note text.]* 
* **Tables** are out of scope and indicated in the text with *[table]*.
* **Formulae** are out of scope and are left uncorrected.
* **Dissertations.** Vol. 1, which contains book-length dissertations, rather than entries, is planned for later release.
* **Further information** is available at [Editorial Standards](https://tu-plogan.github.io/source/c_editorial_standards.html.)

#### Format
* **Files.** Entries are in individual TXT files with a header for the Knowledge Project.
* **ZIP file.** To easily download the complete edition, use the ZIP file.
* **Directories.** Files are organized in directories named for the letter of the entry + the volume number of the print edition. So 'j12' contains all entries in volume 12 beginning with the letter 'j'.
* **File names.** Example: _kp-eb0710-022203-6853-v1.txt_
    * _kp_ = Knowledge Project
    * _eb0710_ = 7th ed., vol. 10
    * _022203_ = page 222, 3rd entry on the page
    * _6853_ = last 4 digits of the source image filename (makes filenames unique)
    * _v1_ = version 1.0
