DWARACA, a town and celebrated temple of Hindustan, province of Gujerat, situated at the south-west extremity of the peninsula. There are twenty-one villages belonging to Dwaraca, containing 2500 houses, and, on the most accurate calculation, 100,000 inhabitants. The inhabitants were formerly much addicted to piracy, but of late years have been restrained by a treaty with the British. The temple is fabled to have been the residence of Krishna, at which 15,000 pilgrims annually pay their devotions, which is an abundant source of wealth to the Brahmins. Long. 69. 15. E. Lat. 22. 21. N.
