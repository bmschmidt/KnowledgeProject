DISTICHIASIS, in Surgery, a disease of the eyelids, when under the ordinary eye-lashes there grows another extraordinary row of hairs, which frequently eradicates the former, and, pricking the membrane of the eye, excites pain, and brings on a defluxion. It is cured by pulling out the second row of hairs with nippers, and cauterizing the pores out of which they are extracted.
