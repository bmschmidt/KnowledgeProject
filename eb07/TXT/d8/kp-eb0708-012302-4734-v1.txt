DOUBLETS, a game on dice within tables. The men, fifteen in number, are placed thus: Upon the six, cinque, and quatre points, there stand three men a piece; and upon the trey, deuce, and ace, only two. He who throws [7:8:124] highest has the benefit of throwing first, and what he throws he lays down, and so does the other; what the one throws and has not, the other lays down for him, but on his own account; and thus they proceed until all the men arc down, and then they bear, as it is called. Hc who is firÄ™t down bears first, and will doubtless win the game if the other throws not doublets to overtake him; which he is sure to do, since he advances or bears as many as the doublets make, namely, eight for two fours.
