DIMOeRITAe, a name given to the Apollinarists, who at first held that the Word only assumed a human body, without taking a reasonable soul; but being at length convinced by formal texts of Scripture, they allowed that he did assume a soul, though without understanding, the Word supplying the want of that faculty. From this way of separating the understanding from the soul, they came to be denominated dimcerites, that is, dividers, separators, from δ∕α, and μοι^αω, I divide.
