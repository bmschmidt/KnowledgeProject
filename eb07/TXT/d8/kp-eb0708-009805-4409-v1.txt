DOM, or Don, a title of honour, invented and chiefly used, the former by the Portuguese, the latter by the Spaniards. It is an abbreviation of dominus, and signifies sir or lord.

This title, it seems, was first given to Pelayo, in the beginning of the eighth century. In Portugal no person can assume the title of Dom without the permission of the king, since it is looked upon as a mark of honour and nobility. In France it is sometimes used among the religious.

Dom and Som, in old charters, signifies full property and jurisdiction.
