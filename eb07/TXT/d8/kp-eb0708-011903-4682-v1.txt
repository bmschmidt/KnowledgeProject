DORPAT, a circle in the Russian province of Livonia, but formerly of Esthonia. It extends over 3420 square miles, and contains a population of 137,415 souls, in two cities and twenty parishes, with 206 noble residences, and 15,331 peasantsâ€™ dwellings. The chief place, the city of the same name, is situated on the great Embach. It is an open city, built in the German style, and by far the best constructed of any place in Livonia. It has a Greek and a Lutheran church, 1200 houses, and about 10,000 inhabitants. It is chiefly remarkable on account of its university, which is the best in Russia, both as regards its professors, and the appropriate collections necessary for instruction in the higher branches of science, particularly of astronomy. There are also good preparatory schools. Long. 26. 37. 45. E; Lat. 58. 22. 47. N.
