DRYADES, in the heathen theology, a sort of deities or nymphs, which, the ancients thought, inhabited groves and woods. They differed from the Hamadryades, the latter being attached to some particular tree, with which they were born, and with which also they died; whereas the former were goddesses of trees and woods in general.
