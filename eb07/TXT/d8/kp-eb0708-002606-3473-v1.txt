DIFFERENCE, in Mathematics, is the remainder, when one number or quantity is subtracted from another.

Difference, in Logic, an essential attribute, belonging to some species, and not found in the genus; being the idea that defines the species. Thus body and spirit are the two species of substance, which in their ideas include something more than is included in the idea of substance. In body, for instance, are found impenetrability and extension; and in spirit, a power of thinking and reasoning; so that the difference of body is impenetrable extension, and the difference of spirit is cogitation.

Difference, in Heraldry, a term given to a certain figure added to coats of arms, serving to distinguish one family from another, and to show how distant younger branches are from the elder or principal branch.
