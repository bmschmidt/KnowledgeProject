DUNMOW, Great, a market-town of the hundred of the same name, in the county of Essex, thirty-seven miles from London, and situated on the river Roding. It is a town of very ancient date, supposed to be the Caesaro-magus of the Romans, and where remains of the road to Colchester, constructed by that people, arc still visible. It is governed by a corporation. The market is held on Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1828, in 1811 to 2015, in 1821 to 2409, and in 1831 to 2462. Near to it is Little Dunmow, remarkable for the ancient right which a happy couple have to demand a flitch of bacon at the end of a year from their marriage.
