DOMINIC de Guzman, founder of the Dominican order of monks, was born at Calahorra, anciently called Ca-lagora, in Old Castille, in 1170. He preached with great fury against the Albigenses when Pope Innocent III. published a crusade against that unhappy people; and he was appointed inquisitor in Languedoc, where he founded his order, and had influence enough to get it confirmed by the Lateran council in 1215. He died at Bologna in 1221, in the fifty-first year of his age, and was afterwards canonized. The Dominican order has produced many illustrious men.
