DRAMMEN, a city of Norway, situated on the river of that name, in the province of Aggerhuus. It is an open city, well built, near a mile in length. It contains 900 houses and 5412 inhabitants. The trade consists in making leather, oil, and sailcloth; in the export of timber and iron, and in the pursuit of the fishery. There are many vessels belonging to the port, but chiefly of small tonnage.
