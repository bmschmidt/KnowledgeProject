DOMIFYING, in Astrology, the dividing or distributing the heavens into twelve houses, in order to erect a theme, or horoscope, by means of six great circles, called circles of position.

There are various ways of domifying. That of Regiomontanus, which is the most common, makes the circles of position pass through the intersections of the meridian and the horizon; but others make them pass through the poles of the zodiac.
