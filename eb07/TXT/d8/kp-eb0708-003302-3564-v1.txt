DINNER, the principal meal of the day. The word is derived from the Frcneh disner, which Du Cange derives from the barbarous Latin disnare; but Hcnry Stephens derives it from the Greek δs∕ffvε∕v, and contends that it should be written dipner. Menage deduees it from the Italian desinare, to dine; and that from the Latin desinere, to leave off work.
