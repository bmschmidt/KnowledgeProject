DURESSE, Hardship, in Law, is where a person is kept in prison or restrained of his liberty contrary to order of law; or is threatened to be killed, maimed, or beaten. In which case, if a person so in prison, or in fear of such threats, make any specialty or obligation, by reason of such imprisonment or threats, such deed is void in law; and in an action brought on such specialty, the party may plead that it was brought by duresse.
