DIGGING, among miners, is appropriated to the operation of freeing any kind of ore from the bed or stratum [7:8:28] in which it lies, where every stroke of their tools turns to account; in contradistinction to the openings made in search of ore, which are called hatches, or essay-hatches, and the operation itself, named tracing of mines, or hatching. When a bed of ore is discovered, the beele-men, so called from the instrument they use, which is a kind of pickaxe, free the ore from the fossils around it; and the shovelmen throw it up from one shamble to another, till it reaches the mouth of the hatch. In some mines, to save the expense as well as fatigue of the shovel-men, they raise the ore by means of a winder and two buckets, one of which ascends as the other descends.
