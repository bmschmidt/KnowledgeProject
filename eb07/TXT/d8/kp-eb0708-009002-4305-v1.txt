DODONIDES, the priestesses who gave oracles in the temple of Jupiter in Dodona. According to some traditions, the temple was originally inhabited by seven daughters of Atlas, who nursed Bacchus, and whose names were Ambrosia, Eudora, Pasithoe, Pytho, Plexaure, Coronis, and Tythe or Tyche. In the latter ages the oracles were always delivered by three old women. The Boeotians were the only people of Greece who received their oracles at Dodona from men, for reasons which Strabo in his ninth book fully explains.
