DIO Chrysostom, that is, Golden Mouth, a celebrated orator and philosopher of Greece, in the first century, was born at Prusa in Bithynia. He attempted to persuade Vespasian to renounce the empire; and he was hated by Domitian, but acquired the esteem of Trajan. This last prinee took pleasure in conversing with him, and made Dio ride with him in his triumphal chariot. There are still extant eighty of his orations, and some other of his works; the best edition of which is that of Hermand Samuel Rai-marus, in 1750, folio.
