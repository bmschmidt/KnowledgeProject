DRUGGET, in commerce, a stuff sometimes all wool, and sometimes half wool half thread; sometimes corded, but usually plain. Those which have the woof of wool and the warp of thread are called threaded druggets ; and those wrought with the shuttle on a loom of four marches are called corded druggets. As to the plain, they are wrought on a loom of two marches, with the shuttle, in the same manner as cloth, camblets, and other like stuffs not corded.
