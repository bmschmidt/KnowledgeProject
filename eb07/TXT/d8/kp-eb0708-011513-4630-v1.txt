DORAK, or Fela hi, a town of Persia, in the province of Kuzistan, situated on two branches of the river Jerahi, in low and marshy ground. It is surrounded by walls about two miles in circumference, built of mud, sixteen feet in thickness, and flanked at regular distances with round towers. It contains few houses within the walls, as the majority of the people, amounting to 8000, prefer living in the suburbs, under the shade of date trees. The palace of the scheik covers a large space of ground, but is in reality a miserable structure, built of bricks dried in the sun, and rapidly going to deeay. It is celebrated for its manufacture of Arabian cloaks, which are exported in great numbers all over Arabia and Persia, but it has little other trade. It is seventy-five miles south of Shuster.
