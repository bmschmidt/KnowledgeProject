DIOPHANTUS, a celebrated mathematician of Alexandria, reputed to be the inventor of algebra. It is not certain when Diophantus lived; some have placed him before Christ, and some after, in the reigns of Nero and the Antonines, but all with equal uncertainty. It seems he is the same Diophantus who wrote the Canon Astrono-micus, which, Suidas says, was commented on by the celebrated Hypatia, daughter of Theon of Alexandria. His reputation must have been very high among the ancients, since they ranked him with Pythagoras and Euclid in mathematical learning. Bachct, in his notes upon the fifth book De Arithmeticis, has collected, from Diophantusâ€™s epitaph in the Anthologia, the following circumstances of his life, namely, that he was married when he was thirty-three years old, and had a son born five years thereafter; that this son died when he was forty-two years of age, and that his father did not survive him above four years. From this it appears that Diophantus was eighty-four years old . wlj,en he died.
