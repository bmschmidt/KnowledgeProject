DOWNS, a bank or elevation of sand, which the sea gathers and forms along its shores, and which serves it as a barrier. The word is formed from the French dune, or the Celtic dun, a mountain. Charles de Visch (Compend. Chronolog. Exord. et Progress. Abbat. Clαriss. B. Marioe, de Duηis) says, Vallem reperit arenarum collibus, quos iη-colae Duynen vocant, undique cinctam. Downs is particularly applied to a famous roadstead for ships along the eastern coast of the county of Kent, from Dover to the North Foreland, where both the outward and homeward bound ships frequently make some stay, and squadrons of men of war rendezvous in time of war. It affords excellent anchorage, and is defended by the castles of Deal, Dover, and Sandwich.
