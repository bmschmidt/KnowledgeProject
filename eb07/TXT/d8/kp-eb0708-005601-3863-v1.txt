Distribution, in Rhetoric, a kind of description, by whieh an orderly division and enumeration is made of the principal qualities of the subject. David supplies us with an example of this kind, when, in the heat of his indignation against sinners, he gives a description of their iniquity: “Their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongues; the poison of asps is under their lips; their mouth is full of cursing and lies; and their feet are swift to shed blood.”

Distribution, in Printing, the taking a form asunder, separating the letters, and disposing them in the cases again, each in its proper cell.
