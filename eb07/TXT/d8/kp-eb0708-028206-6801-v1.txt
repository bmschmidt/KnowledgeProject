DUNKIRK, an arrondissement of the department of the [7:8:283] North, in France, extending over 310 square miles, divided into seven cantons, and these subdivided into fifty-nine communes, containing 86,580 inhabitants.

Dunkirk, a city in the department of the North, in France, at the end of a harbour which is nearly dry at low water. It was formerly more flourishing than it is at present, and once created such apprehensions on the part of England, that in several treaties the demolition of the fortifications was stipulated. It now contains 1800 houses and 24,600 inhabitants. There are still the rudiments of a naval arsenal; and it has some trade, and shipping employed in the whale fishery.
