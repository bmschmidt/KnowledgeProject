DOUBTING, the act of withholding assent from any proposition, on suspicion that we are not thoroughly apprised of its merits, or from not being able peremptorily to decide between the reasons for and against it. Doubting is dist.i≈ãguished by the schoolmen into two kinds, dubi tatio sterilis, and dubitatio efficax. The former is that where no determination ensues; and in this manner doubted the Sceptics and Academics, who withheld their assent from every thing. The latter is followed by judgment, which distinguishes truth from falsehood; and such is the doubting of the Peripatetics and the Cartesians. The dubitatio efficax perpetually inculcates the deceitfulness of our senses, and teaches us that we are to doubt of every one of their reports till they have been examined and confirmed by reason. On the other hand, the Epicureans teach that our senses always tell truth; and that if we deviate ever so little from them, we come within the province of doubting.
