DUISBURG, a city of the Prussian province of Westphalia, on the river Ruhr. It is an active manufacturing place, and carries on a regular trade by weekly passage vessels with Arnheim, Dort, and other places in Holland. There was formerly a university here, which is now reduced to a gymnasium. In 1817 it contained 4510 inhabitants, but their number has since increased.
