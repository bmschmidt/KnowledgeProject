DRIFT, in Navigation, the angle which the line of a ship’s motion makes with the nearest meridian, when she drives with her side to the wind and waves, and is not governed by the power of the helm; it also implies the distance which the ship drives on that line. A ship’s way is only called drift in a storm, and then when it blows so vehemently as to prevent her from carrying any sail, or at least restrains her to such a portion of sail as may be necessary to keep her sufficiently inclined to one side, that she may not be dismasted by her violent labouring produced by the turbulence of the sea.

Drift, in mining, a passage cut out under the earth betwixt shaft and shaft, or turn and turn; or a passage or way wrought under the earth to the end of a meer of ground, or part of a meer.

Drift-äzí'Z, a sail used under water, veered out right a-head by sheets, as other sails are. It serves to keep the ship’s head right upon the sea in a storm, and to hinder her from driving too fast in a current.

Drift- Wood, trees or timber carried out to sea by the rivers when in flood, and then drifted about in various directions, and to different parts, by the currents of the ocean.
