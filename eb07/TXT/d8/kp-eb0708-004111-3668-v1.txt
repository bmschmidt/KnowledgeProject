DISH, in mining, is a trough made of wood, about twenty-eight inches long, four inehes deep, and six inches wide, by which all miners measure their ore. If any be taken selling their ore, not having first measured it by the bar-master’s dish, and paid the king’s duty, the seller forfeits his ore, and the buyer forfeits for every such offence forty shillings to the lord of the field or farmer.
