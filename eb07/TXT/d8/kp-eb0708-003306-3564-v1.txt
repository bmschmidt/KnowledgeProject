DIOCESE, or Diocess, the eircuit or extent of the jurisdiction of a bishop. The word is formed from the Greek διοoi7]ffις, government, administration, derived from δ∕o∕xsω, which the ancient glossaries render administro, moderor, ordino ; and hence διοoοr i δις rr ∣ ζ πολiως, the administration or government of a city. Diocese is also used in ancient authors for the province of a metropolitan.

Diocaesis (δ ∣ οoοηδ ∣ ς) was originally a civil government, or prefecture, composed of different provinces.

The first division of the empire into dioeeses is ordinarily ascribed to Constantine, who distributed the whole Roman world into four, namely, the diocese of Italy, the dioeese of Illyria, that of the East, and that of Africa. And yet long before the time of Constantine, Strabo, who wrote under Tiberius, takes notice (lib. xiii. p. 432), that the Romans had divided Asia into dioceses; and he complains of the confusion which such a division occasioned in geography, Asia being no longer divided by people, but by dioceses, each of which had a tribunal or court, where justice was administered. Constantine, therefore, was only the institutor of those large dioceses, which comprehended several metropolises and governments; the former dioeeses only comprehending one jurisdiction or district, or the country which had resort to one judge, as appears from the above passage in Strabo, and also from two in Cieero (lib. iii. epist. ad Eamil. 9, and lib. xiii. ep. 67).

Thus at first a province included different dioeeses, and afterwards a diocese came to comprehend different provinces. In after times the Roman empire beeame divided into thirteen dioeeses or prefectures; though, including Rome and the suburbic regions, there were fourteen. These fourteen dioeeses comprehended a hundred and twenty provinces; eaeh province had a proeonsul, who resided in the capital or metropolis; and each diocese of the empire had a eonsul, who presided in the principal eity of the district.

On this eivil constitution the eeclesiastieal one was afterwards regulated; and each dioecse had an ecclesiastical viear or primate, who judged finally of all the concerns of the ehurch within his territory. At present, however, diocese does not signify an assemblage of different provinces, but is limited to a single province under a metropolitan, or more eommonly to the single jurisdiction of a bishop.

Brito affirms that dioeese is properly the territory and extent of a baptismal or parochial church; and henee various authors use the word to signify a simple parish. See Parish.
