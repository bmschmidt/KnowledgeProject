DUROTRIGES, an ancient British nation, established [7:8:292] in that part of the country which is now called Dorsetshire. Their name is derived from the two British words dur, water, and trigo, to dwell; and it seems pretty evident that they obtained their name from the situation of their country, which lies along the sea coast. It is not very certain whether the Durotriges formed an independent state under a prince of their own, or were united with their neighbours the Danmonii; for they were reduced by Vespasian under the dominion of the Romans, at the same time and with the same ease as the latter, and never afterwards revolted. The peaceable disposition of the inhabitants was probably the reason why the Romans had so few towns, forts, and garrisons in this pleasant country. Dorchester, its present capital, seems to have been a Roman city of some consideration, though our antiquaries are not agreed about its Roman name. It is most probable that it was the Durnovaria in the twelfth Iter of Antoninus. Many Roman coins have been found at Dorchester. The military way, called Jeening Street, passed through it; and some vestiges of the ancient stonewall with which it was encompassed, and of the amphitheatre with which it was adorned, are still visible. The country of the Durotriges was included in the Roman province called FlaÏ…ia Coesariensis, and was governed by the president of that province as long as the Romans maintained any footing in these parts.
