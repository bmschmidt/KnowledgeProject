DIVAN, a council chamber or court of justice amongst the eastern nations, particularly the Turks. The tvord is Arabic, and signifies the same with sofa in the Turkish dialect.

The word is also used for a hall in the private houses of the orientals. The custom of China does not allow the receiving of visits in the inner parts of the house, but only at the entry, in a divan contrived on purpose for ceremonies.
