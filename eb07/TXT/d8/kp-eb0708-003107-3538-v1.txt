DIMISSORY Letters (Literoe Dimissoriae), in the canon law, a letter given by a bishop to a candidate for holy orders, having a title in his diocese, directed to some other bishop, and giving permission for the ordination of the bearer thereof.

When a person produces letters of ordination or tonsure conferred by any other than his own diocesan, he must at the same time, on pain of nullity, produce the letters dimissory given by his own bishop. Letters dimissory cannot be given by the chapter, sede vacante; this being deemed an act of voluntary jurisdiction, which ought to be reserved to the successor.
