PANDECTS, Pandectae, in jurisprudence, the digest or collection, made by Justinian’s order, of 534 decisions or judgments of the ancient lawyers, on as many questions occurring in the civil law; to all which that emperor gave the force and authority of law, by the epistle prefixed to the collection. The word is Greek, Uανδεκται, being compounded of σrαν, all, and δiχομαι, I take ; that is, a compilation, or a book containing everything relative to public and private rights. Others, however, as Bartoli, think it was formed from σrαν, and δεχομαι, because these books were supposed to contain the whole doctrine of the civil law. See the article Civil Law.
