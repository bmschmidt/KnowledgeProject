PADDINGTON, one of those parishes in the county of Middlesex which, by the increase of building in the vicinity of the metropolis, may be considered as a part of London, with which it is in contact on the north-east part. This in some measure accounts for its rapid growth, which has also been accelerated by the Grand Junction Canal terminating in a capacious basin furnished with storehouses for goods of all kinds. The parish-church is in the centre of a small green, and is an elegant object; and some new churches are in progress. In 1801, the population amounted to 1881, in 1811 to 4609, in 1821 to 6476, and in 1831 to 14,540.
