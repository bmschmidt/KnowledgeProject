PALAeSTRA, in Grecian antiquity, a public building where the youth exercised themselves in wrestling, running, playing at coits, and other feats of strength and skill. To prevent the combatants from hurting themselves by falling, the bottom of the palaestra was covered with dust or gravel. Some think that the palaestra was only a part of the gymnasium. Many authors also imagine that the palaestra was of two kinds, the one for the exercise of the body, the other for the cultivation of the mind; but the derivation of the word seems to confine it exclusively to bodily exercise.
