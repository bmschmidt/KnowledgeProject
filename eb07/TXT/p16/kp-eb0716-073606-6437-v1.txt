PALAeMON, Q. Rhemmius, a famous grammarian of Rome, in the reign of Tiberius, who was born of a slave, at Vienza. We are told he was first brought up to the business of a weaver; but attending his masterâ€™s son to school, he profited by this opportunity of attaining knowledge, and acquired so much skill in common learning, that he ob tained his freedom, and became a teacher or preceptor at Rome. His claim to learning cannot be questioned, since he is recorded as a scholar even by Juvenal. Only some fragments of his works remain.
