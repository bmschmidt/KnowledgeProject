PALINDROMUS, a verse or sentence which runs the same when read either backwards or forwards. Such is the verse,

Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor.

Some people of leisure have refined upon the palindromus, and composed verses, each word of which is the same read backwards as forwards; for instance, that of Camden:

Odo tenet mulum, madidam mappam tenet Anna. Anna tenet mappam madidam, mulum tenet Odo.
