PANEL (panella, panellum), according to Sir Edward Coke, denotes “a little part ;” but the learned Spelman says that it signifies schedula vel pagina, a schedule or roll, as a panel of parchment, or a counterpane of an indenture; but it is used more particularly fora schedule or roll, containing the names of such jurors as the sheriff returns[7:16:789] to pass upon any trial. Hence the impanelling a jury is the entering their names in a panel or little schedule of parchment.
