PANIC denotes an ill-grounded terror or fright. Polyaenus says it originated from Pan, one of the captains of Bacchus, who with a few men put a numerous enemy to route, by a noise which his soldiers raised in a rocky valley, favoured with a great number of echoes. This stratagem making their number appear far greater than it was, the enemy quitted a commodious encampment, and fled. Hence all ill-grounded fears have been called panics, or panic fears; and it was this that gave occasion to the fable of the nymph Echo being beloved by the god Pan. Others derive it from the circumstance, that in the wars of the Titans against the gods, Pan was the first who struck terror into the hearts of the giants. Theon on Aratus says he did it by the means of a sea-shell, which served him for a trumpet.
