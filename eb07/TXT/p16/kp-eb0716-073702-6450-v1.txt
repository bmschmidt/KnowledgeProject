PALARIA, amongst the Romans, a kind of exercise performed at a stake by the soldiers. The stake being fixed in the ground, and six feet in height above it, the young undisciplined soldiers advanced against it, armed with a hurdle and cudgel instead of a sword and shield, and went through all the rules of attack and defence, as if actually engaged with an adversary. Sometimes they stood at a distance, and attacked with missive weapons; at the same time using all the requisite motions for defending themselves, and warding off what might be thrown against them.
