DAVANAGIRI, a town in the south of India, province of Mysore, and district of Chitteldroog. It consists of 500 houses, with a small fort in the centre. It carries on a considerable trade, and has an extensive manufacture of blankets, called cumbies, which in their fabric greatly resemble English camblets. They form a piece of dress which the natives of Karnata almost universally wear, and which is admirably adapted for turning off rain. The goods exported are betel-nut and pepper; and the returns are articles from Madras, imported from Europe, China, Bengal, and the eastern islands; together with salt and a few manufactures from the Coromandel coast.
