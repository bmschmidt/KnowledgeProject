Although a great part of the town is in ruins, it still contains from 15,000 to 20,000 inhabitants. It was formerly a celebrated place, being founded about 400 years before the v Christian era, according to the Persian historians, by King Darab, supposed to be the same as the Darius Nothus of the Greek and Roman authors.
