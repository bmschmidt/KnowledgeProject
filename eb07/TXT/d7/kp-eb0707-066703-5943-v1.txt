DEEMSTERS, or Demsters, from the Saxon dema, judge or umpire. All controversies in the Isle of Man are decided without process, writings, or any charges, by certain judges, chosen yearly from among the people, called deemsters, there being two of them for each division of the island. The deemsters sit as judges in all courts, either for life or property; and, with the advice of twenty-four keys, declare what is law in uncommon emergencies.
