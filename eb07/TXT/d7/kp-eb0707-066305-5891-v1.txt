DECK of a Ship (from decken, to cover), the planked floors of a ship, which connect the sides together, and serve as platforms to support the artillery and lodge the men, as also to preserve the cargo from the sea in merchant vessels. See Ship-building. FIusJi-Dece. implies a continued floor laid from stem to stern, upon one line, without any stops or intervals.

HÎ±lf-DECK, a space under the quarter-deck of a ship of war, contained between the foremost bulk-head of the steerage and the fore-part of the quarter-deck. In the colliers of Northumberland the steerage itself is called the half-deck, and is usually the habitation of the crew.
