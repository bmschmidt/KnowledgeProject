DEPOSITION, in Law, the testimony given in court by a witness upon oath.

Deposition is also used for the sequestrating or depriving a person of his dignity and office.

This deposition only differs from abdication, in that the latter is supposed to be voluntary, and the act of the dignitary or officer himself; whereas the former is compulsory, being the act of a superior power, whose authority extends thus far. Some say the deposition, and some the abdication, of King Jamcs II.

Deposition does not differ from deprivation. We say, indifferently, a deposed or deprived bishop, official, or the like. Deposition differs from suspension, in that it absolutely and for ever divests a priest or other person of all dignity, office, or trust; whereas suspension only prohibits or restrains the exercise of such functions. Deposition only differs from degradation, in that the latter is more formal, and attended with more circumstances, than the former; but in effect and substance they are the same, those additional circumstances being only matter of show, first sct on foot out of zcal and indignation, and kept up by custom, but not warranted by the laws or canons.
