DAMOCLES, one of the flatterers of Dionysius the Elder of Sicily. He admired the tyrantâ€™s wealth, and pronounced him the happiest man on earth. Dionysius prevailed upon him to undertake for a while the charge of royalty, and be convinced of the happiness which a sovereign enjoyed. Damoeles ascended the throne, and whilst he gazed upon the wealth and splendour which surrounded him, he perceived a sword suspended over his head by a horse hair. This so terrified him that all his imaginary felicity vanished at once, and he begged Dionysius to remove him from a situation which exposed his life to such fears and dangers.
