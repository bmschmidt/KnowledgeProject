DEMI (formed from dimidium), a word used in composition with other words to signify half. DEMi-Attici, boroughs or larger villages of Attica. The Athenian tribes were distinguished into Demi. Homer, in his catalogue, distinguishes the Athenians by the appellation of Demos. When Theseus prevailed on them to quit the country and to settle at Athens, they still continued to frequent the demi, and to perform there their several religious ceremonies.
