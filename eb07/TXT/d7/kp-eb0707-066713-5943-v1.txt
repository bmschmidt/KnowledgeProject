DEFEND, in general, signifies much the same with protecting or w arding off injuries offered to any person either by enemies or otherwise.

Defend, in our ancient laws and statutes, signifies to prohibit or forbid; as Usuarios defendit quoque rex Ed-ιvardus ne remanerent in regno. L. L. Edw. Conf. c. 38, and 5 Rich. IL c. 7. In this sense Chaucer also uses the following passage:

Where can, you say in any manner, age, That ever God defended marriage.

In 7 Edward I. there is a statute entitled “Statutum de defensione portandi arma? &c. And “it is defended by law to distrain on the highway.”
