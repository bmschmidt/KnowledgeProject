DAMASK, a sort of silken stuff, having some parts rising above the ground, representing flowers or other figures. Damask should be of dressed silks, both in warp and woof. It derives its name from having been originally brought from Damascus, in Syria.

Damask is also a kind of wrought linen, made in Flanders, and so ealled beeause its large flowers resemble those of damasks. It is chiefly used for tables; and a table-cloth with a dozen of napkins are ealled a damaskservice. Damask is also applied to a very fine steel, prepared in some parts of the Levant, particularly at Damascus, in Syria, whence its name. It is used for sword and eutlass blades, and is finely tempered.
