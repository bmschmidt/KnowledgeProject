DACTYLIC, something which has a relation to dactyls. Anciently there were dactylic as well as spondaic flutes, tibioe dactylicae. The dactylic flutes consisted of unequal intervals, as the dactylic foot does of unequal measures.

Dactylic Verses are hexameter verses, ending in a dactyl instead of a spondee; as spondaic verses are those which have a spondee in the fifth foot instead of a dactyl.
