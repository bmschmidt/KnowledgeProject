DIALA, a river of Kurdistan, which rises a few miles north of Sherazur, in the mountains behind Salymania. It is mentioned in ancient history under the name of Delos and Arba. Taking a southerly course, it receives the tribute of a vast number of smaller streams, and unites with another river equal in size, which has its source at the foot of the Pass of Kurren. It now becomes a fine river, still continues its course to the south, and enters the Tigris about ten miles below Bagdad. It is 150 yards wide where it approaches the Tigris, and has a bridge of boats thrown across it for the convenience of travellers. It is fordable in the summer at Bakooba, about nine miles from Bagdad.
