DAMASKEENING, or Damasking, the art or operation of beautifying iron, steel, and some other metals, by making incisions therein, and filling them up with gold or silver. It is chiefly used for adorning sword-blades, guards, loeks of pistols, and the like.

Damaskeening partakes of the mosaie, of engraving, and of earving. Like the mosaic, it has inlaid work; like engraving, it euts the metal, representing divers figures; and, as in chasing, gold and silver are wrought in relief. There are two ways of damasking; the one, whieh is the finest, is when the metal is eut deep with proper instruments, and inlaid with gold and silver wire; the other is superficial only.
