DENIA, a small city of Spain, in the province of Valencia. It has a tolerable port, and is fortified with a castle and batteries sufficient to protect it. The country around is prolific in vines, and considerable quantities of the grapes are dried here, and exported to England, and various parts of the northern continent, amounting to about 3000 hundredweight annually. It contains 2000 inhabitants, five poor-houses, and two monasteries. Manufactures of linen and woollen cloth are carried on here.
