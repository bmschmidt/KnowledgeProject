DEFENDER of the Faith (Fidei Defensor), a peculiar title belonging to the king of England, as Catlιolicus to the king of Spain, and Christianissimus to the king of France. These titles were given by the popes of Rome. That of Fidei Defensor was first conferred by Leo X. on King Henry VIII. for writing against Martin Luther; and the bull bestowing it bears date quinto idus Octob. 1521. This title was afterwards confirmed by Clement VII. But on Henry’s suppressing the houses of religion at the time of the Reformation, the pope not only deprived him of the title, but also deposed him from his crown, though, in the [7:7:668] thirty-fifth year of his reign, this title was confirmed by parliament, and has continued to be used by all succeeding kings to this day. Chamberlayne says the title belonged to the king of England before that time; and, in proof of his assertion, appeals to several charters granted to the University of Oxford; so that Pope Leo’s bull was only a renovation of an ancient right.
