DAIRI, or Dairo, in the history of Japan, is the sovereign pontiff of the Japanese, or, according to Kaempfer, the hereditary ecclesiastical monarch of Japan. In effect, the empire of Japan is under two sovereigns, namely, an ecclesiastical one called the dairo, and a secular one who bears the title of kubo. The latter is the emperor, and the former the oracle of the religion of the country.
