DECIUS Mus, a celebrated Roman consul, who, after many glorious exploits, devoted himself to the gods manes for the safety of his country in a battle against the Latins, about 340 years before the Augustan agc. His son Decius imitated his example, and devoted himself in like manner in his fourth consulship, when fighting against the Gauls and Samnites. His grandson also did the same thing in the war against Pyrrhus and the Taren tines. This action of devoting oneâ€™s self was of infinite service to the state. The soldiers were animated by the example, and induced to follow with intrepidity a commander who, arrayed in an unusual dress, and addressing himself to the gods with solemn invocation, rushed into the thickest part of the enemy to meet his fate.
