DARDANUS, a son of Jupiter and Electra, who, after the death of his brother Jasion, left Samothrace, his native country, and passed into Asia Minor, where hc married Batia, the daughter of Teucer, king of Teucria. After the death of his father-in-law he ascended the throne, and reigned sixty-two years. He built the city of Dardania, and was reckoned the founder of the kingdom of Troy. He was succeeded by Erichthonius. According to some, Corybas, his nephew, accompanied him to Teucria, where he introduced the worship of Cybele. Dardanus taught his subjects to worship Minerva, and he gave them two statues of the goddess, one of which is well known by the name of Palladium. According to Virgil, Dardanus was by origin an Italian.
