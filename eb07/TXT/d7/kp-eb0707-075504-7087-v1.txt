DIAeTETAe, in Grecian antiquity, a kind of judges, of which there were two sorts; the cleroti and diallacterii. The former were public arbitrators, chosen by lot to determine all causes exceeding ten drachms within their own tribe; and from their sentence an appeal lay to the superior courts. But the latter, on the contrary, were private arbitrators, from whose sentence there lay no appeal; and accordingly they always took an oath to administer justice without partiality.
