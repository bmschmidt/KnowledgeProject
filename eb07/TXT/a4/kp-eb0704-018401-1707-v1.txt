ATTRACTIONS OF ELLIPSOIDS.

28. Let AMBNbe one of theprincipal sections of an ellipsoid, C the centre, AB and MN the axes, D a point in the periphery of the section, and DO perpendicular to MN (Plate CH. fig. 18); the attraction of the ellipsoid upon a particle placed at the pole A is_ to the force with which a particle placed at D is attracted in the direction DO, as AC to DO.

Draw DFG perpendicular to AB, and through F describe an ellipsoid similar to the given ellipsoid, and similarly situated, and having the same centre. Conceive an indefinitely great number of planes, making indefinitely small angles with one another, to be drawn through DG, so as to divide the two ellipsoids into an indefinitely great number of thin solids or slices; then the sections of the ellipsoids made by every one of the planes will be similar and concentric ellipses, each of them having an axis perpendicular to DG (5). Wherefore the attractions of the elements of the ellipsoid FHKL, upon a particle at F, are respectively equal to the attractions of the elements of the ellipsoid AMBN, upon a particle at D in the direction DO (19). λVherefore the whole attraction of the ellipsoid FHKL, upon a particle at F, is equal to the attraction of the ellipsoid AMBN, upon a particle at D, in the direction DO. But the attractions of the ellipsoids AMBN and FHKL, upon particles at A and F, are to one another as AC to CF (8). Wherefore the attraction of the ellipsoid AMBN, upon a particle at the pole A, is to the force with which it attracts a particle at D in the direction DO, as AC to DO.

- 29. The attractions of ellipsoids upon particles placed iri the surface, urging them in directions perpendicular to αnyh ∖ of the principal sections, are proportional to the distances off the particles from that section.

Let AMBN be one of the principal sections of an ellipsoid, C the centre, AB and MN the axes of the section, and P a point in the surface of the solid: the attraction of the ellipsoid upon a particle at the pole A (Plate CH. fig. 19) is to the force with which a particle at P is attracted in a direction parallel to AB, as the semiaxis AC is to the distance of Pfrom the principal section perpendicular to AC.

Draw PDQ perpendicular to the section AMBN, and let it meet the surface again in Q; through D describe an ellipsoid similar to AMBN, similarly situated, and having the same centre; and through P draw a section SPRQ perpendicular to AB. As before, divide the solids into an indefinitely great number of thin slices, by planes drawn through PQ: the sections made by every one of those planes will be similar, and concentric ellipses having an axis of each perpendicular to PQ (5). Wherefore the attractions of the elements of the ellipsoid AMBN, upon a particle at P, in a direction perpendicular to the plane PRQS, are respectively equal to the attractions of the elements of the ellipsoid FHKL upon a particle at D, in a direction perpendicular to the same plane (19). Wherefore the attraction of the ellipsoid AMBN, upon a particle at P, in a direction parallel to the axis AB, is equal to the attraction of the ellipsoid FHKL upon a particle at D in the same direction. But the ellipsoids AMBN and FHKL being similar, their attractions upon particles at A and F are to one another as AC to CF (8); and the attraction of the ellipsoid FHKL, upon a particle at the pole F, is to its attraction upon a particle at D, in a direction parallel to AC, as FC to CN (28). Wherefore (ex cequali) the attraction of the ellipsoid AMBN, upon a particle at the pole A, is to the force with which it attracts a particle at P, in the direction AC, as AC to CN.

This proposition will enable us to find the attractions of an ellipsoid on all points on the surface, or within the solid, when the attractions at the poles are determined.

30. To investigate the differential expressions of the attractions at the poles of an ellipsoid.

Let APD be an ellipsoid; C the centre; AC, CE, and PC, the semiaxes; and PMB a section made by a plane through PC and any point Μ in the surface: draw PM (fig. 20) Prø indefinitely near PM, and Mm perpendicular to Pm; also MR perpendicular to the plane ADB, MS perpendicular to PC, and RH perpendicular to AD. Conceive the plane PCB to revolve about PC, so as to describe an indefinitely small angle BCO; and let PM = f; the angle KPM which PM makes with a perpendicular to the axis = Ô ; and the angle DCB = <p : then, by proceeding as in (23), it will be found that the attraction ot the small pyramid described by the triangle MPoe, urging a particle at P to the centre of the ellipsoid, is = dφ . d¢ cos. θ sin. Ô .f.

Again, let MR = x, HR = y, CH = z ; also let PC — k, AC — T, CE = A"; then x — h — f sin. d; y —f cos.$sin.p; z = f cos. Ô cos. φ ; and if we substitute these values in the equation of the ellipsoid (Def. 2), we shall get (h- — j sin. ô) 2 f‘ 2 cos. 2 ô sin. 2 p∣ ý 2 cos. 2 dcos. 2 p..

T 2 ~ + ^2 + ^jff ’ whence p h 2 sin. ô J T 2 sin. 2 d cos. 2 ð sin. 2 φ cos. 2 ô cos. 2 φ A 2 + ~T 2 1 P 2

This is the value of f at the pole of k ; and, by a like procedure, its values at the poles of k ’ and A" may be found, viz.

Suppose that h is the least of the semiaxes; and let k t2 hd k' 2 — — , a ∏d Λ'' 2 = —; then the values of f at the poles of k, h!', will be respectively λ __ 2 k sin. ô J sin. 2 0 + m cos∙ 2 0 sin∙ 2 p + n cos. 2 0 cos. 2 p , 2 k' sin. ô × m m sin. 2 0 + cos. 2 è sin. 2 φ +- n cos. 2 ô cos. 2 φ p 2 h η sin. ô × n J .n sin. 2 ô + cos. 2 ô sin. 2 φ + m cos. 2 ô cos. 2 φ

Now let A, A', A", denote the attractions of the spheroid upon particles placed at the poles of k, k t , k” ; then, by substituting the values of/just found in the foregoing differential expression, we get a _ j ι X i*Γ 2 d φ.d ű cos, ô sin. 2 ô d J sin. 2 ô + m cos. 2 ô sin. 2 φ +∙ η cos. 2 ô cos. 2 φ A' — kt χ s s m × 2<Z . c? đ cos, ô sin. 2 ô JJ m sin. 2 û + cos. 2 û sin. 2 <p + n cos. 2 è cos· 2 bĩ = li ’ X Γ Γ η × 2d <p . d ô cos, ô sin. 2 ô J J η sin. 2 ô + cos. 2 ô sin. 2 φ + m cos· 2 è cos. 2 the limits of the integrals being from û = 0 and φ = 0 to ô = ģ and φ = 2 w.

31. To reduce the expressions of the polar attractions to the most simple integrals.

Let us consider the general expression Γ Γ d φ . d ô cos. ô sin. 2 ê J J a sin. 2 0 + β cos. 2 ô sin. 2 φ + γ cos. 2 ô cos. 2 p’ which includes all the formulas found in (30). Let p = α sin. 2 ô + β . cos. 2 0, and q = α sin. 2 0 + γ cos. 2 0; then the above expression will become ΓΓ d <ρ . d ê cos. 0 sin. 2 0

J J p sin. 2 <ρ + q cos. 2 φ

Suppose s —Ί . —- ’ ∙ ĩ- = — ; t1 ιen the preceding

∖ p ∕ cos. φ cos. u 1 0 expression will become, by substitution, ΓΓ du.d ê cos. 0 sin. 2 0

. jj ^jt⅛ ; the limits of u being from 0 to 2fl ’ j wherefore, by integrating with regard to u, and restoring the values of p and ι b the integral becomes

2 ¶ F d 0 . cos. 0 sin 2 0 d V (α sin. 2 ø + β cos. 2 0) . (a sin. 2 0 +∙ γ cos. 2 0)

and, by putting χ = sin. 0, the integral, which is to be taken from i = 0 to 0 = or from χ = 0 to x = 1, will become

2 * f ~- dχ J ∖ β + (α— β) ad] . [y + (α — γ) a? 2]

If now we take α, β, γ, so as to make the assumed expression coincide with the quantities A, A', A", respectively, we shall get F

A = 4 σ ⅛ . f ad dχ J h∕ [m +∙ (1— m) ad] . [n +∙ (1 — n) jτ 2 j
