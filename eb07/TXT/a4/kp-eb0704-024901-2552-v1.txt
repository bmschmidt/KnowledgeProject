AVADOUTAS, a sect of Indian Brahmins, who in austerity surpass all the rest. The other sects retain earthen vessels for holding their provisions, and a stick to lean on; but none of these are used by the Avadoutas; they only cover their nakedness with a piece of cloth, and some of them even dispense with that, going quite naked, and besmearing their bodies with cow-dung. When hungry', some enter into houses, and, without speaking, hold out their hands; eating on the spot whatever is given them. Others retire to the sides of holy rivers, and there expect the peasants to bring them provisions, which they generally do very liberally.
