AULA is used by Spelman for a court-baron; by some old ecclesiastical writers for the nave of a church, and sometimes for a court-yard.

Aula Regia, or Regis, a court established by William the Conqueror in his own hall, composed of the kingâ€™s great officers of state, who resided in his palace, and were usually attendant on his person. This court was regulated by the article which forms the eleventh chapter of Magna Charta, and was established in Westminster Hall, where it has ever since continued.
