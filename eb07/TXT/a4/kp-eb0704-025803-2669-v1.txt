AYLSHAM, a market-town of the hundred of South Erpingham, in the county of Norfolk, 112 miles from London. It has a good market-place, is a cheerful looking town, and is connected with the sea by a navigable canal. There was formerly some trade in knitting stockings, which has much declined of late years. The market is held on Saturday. The population in 1801 amounted to 1667, in 1811 to 1760, and in 1821 to 1853.
