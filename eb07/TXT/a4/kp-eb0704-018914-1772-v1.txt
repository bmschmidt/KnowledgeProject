AUCTION, a kind of public sale, much in use for the disposal of household goods, books, plate, and other articles. By this method of sale the highest bidder is always the buyer. Auction was originally a kind of sale among the ancient Romans, performed by the public crier sub hαstα, i. e. under a spear stuck up on the occasion by some magistrate, who made good the sale by delivery of the articles.
