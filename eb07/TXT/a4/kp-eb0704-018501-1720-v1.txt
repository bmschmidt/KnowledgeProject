33. To find the attractions of an ellipsoid upon a particle placed without the surface.

Let h, h', h'', be the semiaxes of the ellipsoid, and a, b, c (respectively parallel to h, h, h") the co-ordinates of a particle without the surface. Let h, 7f, Id, so related to k, h', li ’ , that Λ' 2 — Λ 2 = 7f 2 — 19 and 7√' 2 — Λ 2 = h" 2 — Λ 2 , denote the senιiaxes of another ellipsoid, which contains the attracted point in its surface, and has its principal sections in the same planes as the given ellipsoid: then, because the attracted point is in the surface, we have (Def. 2) ^ĩ + ^ + £-i.

ä 2 τ ∕τ 2 τ h" i ~ , and, because Λ' 2 — Λ 2 = h? — 19 — s 2 , and 7√' 2 — 19 = Λ" 2 — 19 — g' 2 , we get q2 i 4. g2 _ 1 19 τ 19 + 9 19 + C

This equation now contains only one unknown quantity; and it is plain that one value of h, and only one, can be found from it. For, when h — 0, the function on the left hand side is infinitely great; and while h increases from 0 ad infinitum, the same function decreases continually from being infinitely great to be infinitely little. When h is found, then h — V19 + 9, and h" = Vh 2 + s' 2 . Because a, b, c, are the co-ordinates of a point in the surface of the ellipsoid, we may suppose a — h sin. m, b — h cos. m sin. n, c -h' cos. m cos. n; let a' = k sin. m, b' — h cos. m sin. n, d = h ’ cos. m cos. η : οx a' =. ĩį. y. a, b' =. ½— f h h f Id . × b, d — — × c; then a', b ’ , c ’ , will be the co-ordinates of a point in the surface of the given ellipsoid, and consequently it will be within the other solid.

The preceding propositions contain a complete theory of homogeneous elliptical spheroids. They enable us to compute the attractive force with which a solid of this kind urges a particle placed anywhere in the surface, within the solid, or without it. It remains, indeed, to find the exact value of the function F in its general form, to which we can do no more than approximate by series; but this is an analytical difficulty which it is impossible to overcome, because the nature of this function is such that it cannot be expressed in finite terms by the received notation of analysis.

In the preceding investigations we have followed the method of Maclaurin for points situated in the surface of a spheroid or within the solid. This method has always been justly admired; but neither its inventor, nor, as far as we know, any other geometer, has applied it, excepting to spheroids of revolution; and it is here, for the first time, extended to ellipsoids. In regard to points without the surface, we have employed the method first given by Mr Ivory, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1809. The combination of these two methods has enabled us to derive the attractions of an ellipsoid on a point placed anywhere from the attractions at the poles. Thus, this extremely complicated problem has, by geometrical reasoning of no great difficulty, been reduced to the investigation of the polar attractions, which are the only cases that require a direct computation.

34. Of the attractions of spheroids composed of elliptical shells that vary in their densities and figures according to any law.

When a spheroid is composed of concentric elliptical shells of variable density and figure, we may consider every shell as the difference of two homogeneous spheroids of the same density with the shells, and having their surfaces coinciding with the surfaces of the shell. The attractions of the spheroids being computed by the preceding methods, their difference will be equal to the attractions of the shell, and the integral obtained by summing the attractions of all the shells will give the attractions of the heterogeneous spheroid. This case, therefore, gives rise to no new difficulties, except such as are purely mathematical, and depend upon the law according to which the densities and figures of the shells are supposed to vary.
