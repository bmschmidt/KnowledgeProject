ASTYAGES, son of Cyaxares, the last king of the Medes. He dreamed, that from the womb of his daughter Mandane, married to Cambyses king of Persia, there sprung a vine that spread itself over all Asia. She being with child, he resolved upon the destruction of the infant when born, and commissioned Harpagus to execute his barbarous purpose, who, however, preserved the child, which was named Cyrus. Astyages long afterwards hearing that his inhuman plan had been thus frustrated, caused Harpagus to eat his own son. Harpagus called in Cyrus, who dethroned his grandfather, and thereby ended the monarchy of the Mcdes.
