AUREOLA, in its original signification, signifies a jewel, which is proposed as a reward of victory in some public dispute. Hence the Roman schoolmen applied it to denote the reward bestowed on martyrs, virgins, and doctors, on account of their works of supererogation; and painters use it to signify the crown of glory with which they adorn the heads of saints, confessors, and martyrs.
