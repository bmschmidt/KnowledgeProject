AIEMPO Giusto, in Music, signifies to sing or play in an equal, true, and just time.

Al ERGATIS, in Mythology, a goddess of the Syrians, supposed to be the mother of Semiramis. She was represented with the face and breasts of a woman, but the rest of her body resembled a fish. Vossius says the term signifies without fish, and conjectures that the votaries of this deity abstained from fish.
[7:4:113]
