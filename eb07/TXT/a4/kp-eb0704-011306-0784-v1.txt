ATHELING, Adeling, Edeling, Ethling, or Etheling, among the Anglo-Saxons, was a title of honour, properly belonging to the heir-apparent or presumptive to the crown. This honourable appellation was first conferred by King Edward the Confessor on Edgar, to whom he was great uncle, when, being without any issue of his own, he intended to make him his heir.
