AUREUS, a Roman gold coin, equal in value to 25 denarii. According to Ainsworth, the aureus of the higher empire weighed near five pennyweights, and in the lower empire little more than half that weight. We learn from Suetonius that it was customary to give aurei to the victors in the chariot races.
