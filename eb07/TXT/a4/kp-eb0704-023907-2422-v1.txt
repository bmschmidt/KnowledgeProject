Autumn is represented tn painting by a man at perfect age, clothed like the verbal, and likewise girded with a starry girdle, holding in one hand a pair of scales equalĩy poised, with a globe in each, and in the other a bunch of divers fruits and ∏ ls age denotes the perfection of this season; an the balance that sign of the zodiac which the sun enters when oui autumn begins.
