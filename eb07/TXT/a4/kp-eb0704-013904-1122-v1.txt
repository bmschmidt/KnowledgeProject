ATOOI, one of the larger Sandwich Islands, in the South Pacific Ocean. Towards the north-east and northwest the country is rugged and broken, but to the southward it is more level. The hills rise from the sea with a gentle acclivity, and at a little distance back are covered with wood. The produce of this island is the same with that of the rest of the cluster; but its inhabitants greatly excel their neighbours in the management of their plantations. It is nearly 30 miles in length, and contains about 54,000 inhabitants. Long. 200. 20. E. Lat. 21. 57. N.
