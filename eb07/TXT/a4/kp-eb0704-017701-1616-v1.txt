ATTRACTION OF SPHERES.

11. Spheres of the same homogeneous matter attract particles placed on their surfaces with forces proportional to their radii.

Spheres being similar solid-figures, this proposition is no more than a particular ease of what was before proved < 8 > Cor. If the spheres have different densities, the attractions at their surfaces are proportional to their radii multiplied by their densities. (8, Cor.)

12. The force with which a particle, placed anywhere within a sphere of homogeneous matter, is urged towards the centre, is proportional to its distance from the centre.

Conceive a concentric sphere to be described, which contains the attracted particle in its surface; the matter between the two surfaces will exert no foree on the particle (9), which will therefore be urged to the centre, only by the attraction of the inner sphere, in the surface of which it is placed; but this foree is proportional to the radius of the sphere, or to the distance of the particle from the centre (11).

13. Let PNQ and AEG (fig. 7) be two spheres of the same homogeneous matter, which attracts in the inverse proportion of the square of the distance ; let the centres of the spheres be at Μ and D, and take ĨIR equal to the radius of the sphere ABC, and ED equal to the radius of the sphere PNQ ; the attractions of the spheres upon particles placed at R and E arc to one another as the squares of the radii of the spheres.

In the spheres draw two great circles perpendicular to the diameters PQ and AC, that pass through the points R and E; and let PpQ and A6C be two great circles, making equal indefinitely small angles NMp and BD6 with the great eireles PNQ and ABC. Let HK and FG, parallel to PQ and AC, be any two chords of the circles P∕>Q and AZ>C, that subtend similar arcs, or arcs containing the same number of degrees; and through HK and^ FG let planes perpendicular to the circles P∕>Q and AZ>C, v be drawn to cut the portions of the spheres contained in the angles NM/? and BD6,∙ join RH, RK, MH, MK, DF, DG, EF, EG. Because the ares subtended by HK and FG are like parts of their eireumferences, it is plain that the angle RMH = EDF, and RMK = EDG. And because ED = MH = MK, and RM = DF = DG (hyp. ∖ therefore RH = EF, and RK = EG.

Conceive the chords HK and FG, together with the planes passing through them, to change their place a little, so as to describe two slender prisms, or elements of the portions of the spheres contained in the angles NMy and BDX. It is plain that MX and DO, the distances of the chords HK and FG from the centres of their circles, are constantly proportional to MN and DB, the radii of the spheres; wherefore XT and OS, the perpendicular sections of the small prisms, are similar figures, and have to one another the same ratio that MX 2 has to DO 2 , or MN 2 to DB 2 . Now, the attraction of the prism HK urging a particle at R to the centre Μ, is

= XT × — vÅvY (1θ); and the attraction of the

∖RH RK∕ v z prism FG urging a particle at E to the centre D, is = OS × (τj^r — Ēō)* B ut * n consef l uenee °f what 1 1 1 1 1

was proved, τ - v7 — - — = —- — 7tfγ ; wherefore the at- i RH RK EF EG

tractions of the prisms are to one another as XT to OS, or as MN 2 to DB 2 . The same thing may be proved of all the elements of the two portions of the spheres contained in the angles NMy and BDó; wherefore those portions attract particles at R and E with forces proportional to the squares of the radii of the spheres. But because the small angles NM∕> and BD6 are equal, each of the spheres may be divided into an equal number of such portions; wherefore the attractions of the whole spheres upon particles placed at R and E are proportional to the squares of the radii of the spheres.

Cor. This proposition is true when the particles of matter attract one another with forces proportional to any proposed function of the distance.

Let RH = EF = f, and RK = EG = f' ; then, adopting the same notation as before (10, Cor.), the attractions of the prisms urging particles placed at R and E to the centres Μ and D, are respectively XT × =±= [Y(∕)-Ψ (/-)], and OS X →= [Ψ(∕)-ΨCf]z consequently, those attractions have the same proportion that XT has to SO, or MN 2 to DB 2 . Wherefore the attractions of the whole spheres are in the same proportion.

14. A particle placed anywhere without a sphere of homogeneous matter which attracts in the inverse proportion of the square of the distance, will be urged to the centre of the sphere with a force that is inversely proportional to the square of the particles distance from the centre.

Let ABC (Plate CI. fig. 8) be the sphere, 0 its centre, and P a particle without the sphere: conceive a concentric sphere PMN, of the same homogeneous matter with the sphere ABC, to be described with the radius PO. Then, by the last proposition, the attraction of the sphere ABC upon the particle P is to the attraction of the sphere PMN, upon a particle placed at A, as AO 2 to PO 2 . But the attraction of the sphere PMN upon a particle placed at A is equal to the attraction of the sphere ABC upon the same particle; for the attraction of the matter between the two spherical surfaces exerts no force upon a particle at A (9). Wherefore, in the proportion set down above, the two middle terms are con- [7:4:178] .stantly the same wherever the point P is placed without the sphere ABC; consequently the first term of the proportion must follow the inverse ratio of the last term; that is, the attraction of the sphere ABC upon the external particle at P is inversely proportional to PO 2 .

15. The same law of attraction being supposed, a homogeneous sphere will attract a particle placed τvithout it, with the same force as if all the matter of the sphere were collect ed in the centre.

Let/denote the distance of the particle from the centre; then it follows, from the last proposition, that the attraction of the sphere upon the particle will have for its measure; A denoting a constant quantity that will be determined by any particular case; that is, by the actual attractive force corresponding to any determinate distance from the centre. Let r denote the radius of the sphere, and Μ its mass; then no part of the matter of the sphere being nearer the attracted particle than (∕— r), and none of it more remote than (f + r), the attraction of the

Μ

sphere on the particle will be greater than θ ι ,ψ and less than z . Therefore is always contained be- (f-τ) 2 ∕ 2 tween those limits, which requires that A = Μ. For, if A were greater than Μ, such values of f might be found 11 1 A 1 Μ 1 as would make equal to or greater than; and if A were less than Μ, such values of f might be found as A Μ

would make equal to or less than - r fi-.—r-. There- f 2 (∕+υ 2 fore A = Μ; and the attraction of the sphere is equal to Μ

- 7 ,-, or the same as if all the matter were collected in the J centre.

If the radius of the sphere = r, the density of the matter contained in it = d ; then the mass, or Μ, = —-— 3 (τr being the circumference of the circle whose diameter is unit), and the attraction of the sphere at the distance f η il i 4 ιrPd rr , 1 . . . 11 , from the centre . 1hιs is still true at the surface z 3 ∙ 7 of the sphere when f = r, so that the attraction at the l , 4 πrd ... surface = —-—; which expression, with the help of what is proved in (12), enables us to compare the intensities of the attractions of homogeneous spheres, at all distances from the centre, without or within the surfaces.

Cor. 1. A shell of homogeneous matter contained between two concentric spherical surfaces, will attract a particle placed without it, with the same force as if all the matter of the shell were collected in its centre.

For the attractive force of such a shell is equal to the difference of the attractions of two concentric spheres of the same homogeneous matter with the shell.

Cor. 2. A sphere composed of concentric shells, that vary in their densities according to any law, will attract a particle placed without it, with the same force as if all the matter were collected in the centre.

For this having been proved of one shell {Cor. 1), it must be true of any number of shells.

If {r) denote the density at the distance r from the centre, the quantity of matter in the sphere will be = 4 <r .y* <p (r) . Adr; and the attraction on a particle without the sphere at the distance f from the centre 4 V .f<p (r) . r 2 dr = ’

16. Two spheres, each composed of concentric shells of variable density, attract one another with the same force as if all the matter of each were collected in its centre.

For the attraction of a sphere A upon every particle of another sphere B will remain the same, if we suppose all the matter of A to be collected in its centre (15). But the attraction of any particles of matter placed in A’s centre upon the sphere B is equal and opposite to the attraction of B, upon the same matter so placed; and again, the attraction of B upon all the particles placed in the centre of A, will remain unchanged, if we suppose the matter of B to be collected in its centre. Wherefore A attracts B with the same force as if the matter of each were collected in its centre.

17. Supposing that the particles of matter attract with α force proportional to the distance, a body of any shape will attract a particle of matter placed anywhere with the same force, and in the same direction, as if all the matter of the body were collected in its centre of gravity.

Suppose that the attracted particle is placed at P (fig. 9), and the centre of gravity of the attracting body atG; join PG, and let any plane pass through that line. Let L be a small part, or element of the body, and from L draw LK perpendicular to the plane passing through PG, and KF perpendicular to PG; join PL and PK. Put dm to denote the quantity of matter, or the mass of the element L; then its attractive force, urging the particle in the direction PL, is = PL × dm, which, by the resolution of forces, is equivalent to the two forces PK × dm and KL × dm ; and again, the single force PK X dm is equivalent to the two forces FK X dm, and PF × dm — PG X dm + GF X dm. Wherefore, the attraction of the element L upon the particle at P is equivalent to these four separate forces, viz. PG X dm, GF X dm, FK X dm, KL X dm, which urge the particle P respectively in the directions PG, GF, FK, KL. But, from the nature of the centre of gravity, the sum of all the forces, KL X dm, that urge the particle P to one side of the plane passing through PG, is just equal to the sum of the forces that urge it to the other side of the same plane; and the sum of all the forces, FK X dm, that urge P to one side of the line PG, is just equal to the sum of the forces that urge it to the other side of the same line; and the sum of all the forces, GF X dm, that urge P towards the point G, is just equal to the sum of the forces that urge it from the same point. Wherefore all the preceding forces mutually destroy one another, excepting the forces PG X dm, the sum of which, when extended to all the elements of the attracting body, is = PG X mass of the body. Wherefore the whole attraction upon P is the same as if all the matter of the body were collected in its centre of gravity.

Cor. Supposing that the particles of matter attract with a force proportional to the distance, a homogeneous sphere will attract a particle placed anywhere, in the same manner as if all the matter of the sphere were collected in the centre.

For the centre of gravity of a homogeneous sphere is the same as the centre of its figure. This corollary is likewise true of a sphere composed of concentric shells of variable density; and it is easy to apply the demonstration of (16) to prove that, in this law of attraction, two spheres, each composed of concentric shells of variable density, will attract one another with the same force as if the matter of each were collected in its centre.

18. To investigate tνhat arc the laws of attraction in re- [7:4:179] •yard to the distance according to which a shell of homogeneous matter, contained between two concentric spherical surfaces, mill attract a particle placed without it, in the same manner as if all the matter of the shell were collected in the centre.

It has been proved that this property actually belongs to homogeneous shells in the law of attraction which obtains in nature, and likewise when the particles of matter attract with a force proportional to the distance; but it is interesting to know whether it is confined to these two Cases alone, or extends to other laws of attraction. This can only be discovered by a direct analysis.

Let r = PC (fig. 10), the distance of the attracted point from the centre of the shell; u — C A, the radius of the inner surface of the shell; f = PM, the distance of P from any point in the surface. Having drawn the diameter AD through P, let AMD and AND be two great circles, making with one another an indefinitely small angle MAN = dq; and let two small circles BMG, bmg, indefinitely near one another, of which A and D are the poles, meet the former circles in Μ, N, m, η ; and draw MS, NS to the centre of the circle BMG. Put đ for the measure of the arc AM; then MS = u sin. đ; MN = dq.u sin. Ô; Mm = udð ; and the quadrilateral space MN≡ — u? .dq.dô sin. Ô. We may suppose the thickness of the shell indefinitely small, since, if the property belong to an elementary shell indefinitely thin, it will be true of one of a determinate thickness, which can be resolved into such elements. Suppose the thickness of the shell to be = du; then the quantity of matter in the part standing upon the quadrilateral space MNβm = u 2 du .dq .dô sin. Ô. Let φ (f) represent the direct attraction of a particle at Μ in the direction PM; then its attraction directed to the centre „ ∕ j λ ps r — w cos. đ

C = φ(f) × = y × 'φ (f) ; and the attrac tion of the element of the shell in the same direction =

», j jλ - . r—wcos-đ λ n 1 du.dq.dô sin. Ô × y . φ (J). 1 his expression is proportional to dq, when ô and/remain constant; and therefore (denoting by π the circumference of the circle whose diameter is unit) the attraction of the whole zone contained between the small circles BMG, bmg, will be r , ο, ∙ r — u cos. ô , ». 1 . = . u i du. dô sin. ô. y . φ (J) ; and the attractive force of the whole shell will be

2¢r. u-duJ dô sin.đ. y— ∙ φ (∕) ; the fluent to be extended from ô = 0 to ô = it.

Again, the quantity of matter in the shell is = 4ιr. u 2 du ; and the attraction of this matter placed in the centre, at the distance r from P, is = 4nr. ιfdu. φ (r).

If now we equate the attraction of the shell to the attraction of its matter placed in the centre, and leave out the factors common to both, we shall get 2φ(T)=J dô sin. Ô. y . φ (f), the limits of the integral being the same as before.

But f 2 = r 2 — 2ru cos. 0A∙u 2 ; then dô sin. ð =∙ i ^j also ru

φ + r≈ - m ≡) pdf. φ (f) - ^sfdfsdf. ţ (f), the limits of this integral beingfrom∕= r — utof — rA∙ u, which correspond to ô = 0 and ô z=ιr.

Now let sđf. φ (f) = -r (f) ; and ffdf fdf. φ (f) = sj'ĳ'·'* (f) =~r Çf)ĩ then, by taking the fluents between the proper limits, we get

If we develope the binomial functions in the last expression, all the even powers of u will disappear, and the odd powers only will remain; these last terms being all contained in this general formula, VIZ · 1.2.3...2n+T'

Thus the most general expression of the law of attraction, that possesses the property in question, is a combination of the two laws above mentioned, with each of which it coincides, according as we make the one or other of the constant quantities equal to nothing. We have, therefore, a direct proof that the law of nature is the only one which will make the attraction decrease as the distance increases, and in which a spherical shell, or a sphere, will attract in the same manner as if all the matter were collected in the centre.

Laplace has arrived at the same conclusion by a different process. (Mec. Céleste, livre ii. chap. 2, No. 12, Rem. part.)

attraction of spheroids of revolution.

19. Let APBQ (Plate CH. fig. 11) and CMDNbe two concentric ellipses, similar to one another, and similarly situated, of which AB and CD are either the greater or less [7:4:180] • axes ; and let PCQ he perpendicular to AB. Conceive the ellipses to revolve about PQ, so as to describe an indefinitely small angle ; then, supposing the law of attraction to be inversely proportional to the square of the distance, the thin solid of homogeneous matter described by the ellipse APBQ will attract a particle placed at P, in a direction perpendicular to any plane passing through P Q, with the same force that the thin solid of the same matter described by the ellipse CMDN, will attract a particle placed at C perpendicularly to the same plane.

From C draw CM, CN, making equal angles with CD, and PR, PT respectively parallel to CM, CN; and let Cm, Cn, Ρr, IV, be drawn in the same manner, and indefinitely near the former lines. While the ellipses revolve about PQ, the small sectors will describe pyramids that have their vertices at C and P∙ It is manifest that the pyramids so described are similar; for their angels at C and P in the planes of the ellipses are equal; and their other angles, described by revolving about PQ, are likewise equal, because the sectors are equally inclined to that axis. Wherefore the direct attractions of all the small pyramids upon the particles P and C are proportional to the lengths PR, PT, CM, CN (7); and consequently the forces that urge the particles P and C in a direction at right angles to any plane passing through PQ are proportional to the perpendiculars let fall upon that plane from R, T, M, N. But because PR, PT, CM, CN are equally inclined to PQ, they will make equal angles with any plane passing through PQ; wherefore the perpendiculars drawn to the plane from R, T, M, N, will be respectively proportional to PR, PT, CM, CN. But CM + CN = PR + PT (6); wherefore the sum of the perpendiculars drawn to the plane from Μ and N will be equal to the sum of the perpendiculars drawn to it from R and T. Consequently the force of the pyramids PR and PT, which urges the particle P at right angles to the plane, is equal to the force of the pyramids CM and CN, which urges the particle C in a parallel direction. The same thing is true of all the small pyramids that make up the thin solids described by the ellipses APBQ and CMDN; and it is therefore true of the whole solids.

It is to be observed that when the pyramids PR and PT fall on opposite sides of PQ, it is the difference oi their attractions which is equal to the sum of the attractions of CM and CN; and it is the difference of the perpendiculars∕let fall from T and R on opposite sides of the plane, which is equal to the sum of the perpendiculars let fall from Μ and N.

20. Let APBQ be a spheroid of revolution, PQ the axis of revolution, and A CB a plane through the centre perpendicular to PQ (Plate ĊII. fig. 12). If D be a particle in the surface of the spheroid, and DL perpendicular to the plane A CB ; then the attraction of a spheroid on a particle placed at the pole P, will be to the force with which a particle placed at D is attracted in the direction DL, as PC is to DL.

Through D draw a plane parallel to the plane ACB, and let the plane so drawn cut the axis PQ in F; draw the straight line DFE to terminate in the spheroid, and describe another spheroid through F, having the same centre with the spheroid APBQ, and similar to it, and similarly situated. Conceive an indefinitely great number of planes, making indefinitely small angles with one another, to be drawn through DE, so as to divide the two spheroids into an indefinitely great number of thin solids or slices; then the sections which everyone of the planes make with the spheroids will be similar ellipses, having the same centre (5); and it is manifest that a straight line drawn through F at right angles to DE, in any one of the planes, will pass through the centre of the two ellipses contained in it, and will coincide with an axis of each. Wherefore the force with which every one of the slices or elements of the spheroid ΛPBQ attracts a particle placed at D in the direction DL, is equal to the force with which the corresponding slice or element of the spheroid GFHK attracts a particle placed at F in the direction FC (19). Wherefore, the whole attraction of the spheroid APBQ upon a particle at D, in the direction DL, is equal to the whole attraction of the spheroid GFHK upon a particle at F. But the attractions of the spheroids APBQ and GFHK upon particles placed at P and F, are to one another as PC to FC (8). Wherefore, the attraction of the spheroid APBQ upon a particle at P, is to the force with which the same spheroid attracts a particle at D, in the direction DL, as PC is to FC or DL.

21. Let APBQbe a spheroid of revolution, andPQ the axis of revolution as before. If D he a particle in the surface, ADPB (fig. 13) a section through D, and the axis PQ and DL perpendicular to PQ; the attraction of the spheroid upon a particle at A will he to the force with which a particle at D is attracted, in the direction DL, as AC is to DL.

Through D draw a plane perpendicular to AB, which cuts the section ADB in the straight line DFE; and let a spheroid FGHK be described through F, having the same centre with the spheroid APBQ, and similar to it, and similarly situated. Then, conceiving the two spheroids to be divided into an indefinitely great number of thin slices by planes passing through DE, the force with which every slice or element of the spheroid APBQ attracts a particle at D in the direction DL, will be equal to the force with which the corresponding slice or element of the spheroid FGHK attracts a particle at F (19). But the attractions of the spheroids APBQ and FGHK upon particles placed at A and F are to one another as AC to CF (8). Wherefore, the attraction of the spheroid APBQ upon a particle at A is to the force with which the same spheroid attracts a particle at D, in the direction DL, as AC to FC or DL.

The two last propositions will enable us to find both the direction and the intensity of the attraction of a homogeneous spheroid of revolution upon a particle placed anywhere on the surface, when we have ascertained the attractive forces at the poles and at the circumference of the circular section made by a plane through the centre perpendicular to the axis. For the whole attraction at any point is the compound force arising from the attractions perpendicular to the axis, and parallel to it. The next object ^of our research is, therefore, to determine the two forces above mentioned, viz. the attraction at the poles, and at the circular section equally distant from both poles.

22. Let ABD be an indefinitely slender pyramid, of zvhich the base BD is perpendicular to the edge AD (fig. 14); let B—base BD, and f = length AD∕ then - — the attraction of the whole matter of the pyramid upon a particle placed at the vertex A.

23. To investigate the attraction of a homogeneous spheroid of revolution upon a particle placed at the pole.

Let P (fig· lð) b e t ^ ιe pole, PCQ the axis of revolution, and APBQ a section of the spheroid by a plane passing through PQ, and any point Μ, in the surface; draw PM, P∕∕i indefinitely near PM, and Mm perpendicular to Pm. Conceive the plane PMQ to revolve about PQ, so as to describe the indefinitely small angle BCO; then the small triangle MPm will describe a slender pyramid, having its vertex at P, and of which the base is a rectangle, contained by Mm and RT; for the point Μ moving parallel to R it will describe a line equal and parallel to that described by R, namely, to RT.

Let PM —f and the angle KPM, which PM makes with a perpendicular to the axis, = đ, and the indefinitely small angle BCO = d<ρ. Then Mm —fdô, RT = CR × dφ =οfcos. ô. d<ρ, and B, the base of the slender pyramid described by the triangle MPm, -=d<ρ.d ð cos. ô .f 2 ; wherefore the direct attraction of the pyramid on a particle at p—y-(22) = c∕p.<Z đcos. ô .f, and the elementary attraction of the spheroid in the direction PC = direct attrac-

In an oblate spheroid, h is less than h’ : put Λ' 2 — Λ 2 = h 2 . e 2 , and z = sin. ð ; then the element of the attractive force will become, by substitution,

Cor. In an oblate spheroid differing little from a sphere, e 2 will be a very small fraction, of which we may reject the higher powers. When this is done, the preceding expression of the polar attraction, viz.

Let P (Plate CH. fig. 16) be the pole, PC the axis of revolution, A a point in the circular section AOB, made by a plane through the centre perpendicular to PC. Let Μ be any point in the surface of the spheroid, AMO a section through A and Μ by a plane perpendicular to to AOB, Am a line in that plane indefinitely near AM, and Mm perpendicular to Am, MR perpendicular to AO, and RS to AB. Conceive the plane AMO to revolve about A, so as to describe an indefinitely small angle OAQ; then the triangle AMm will describe a slender pyramid, having its vertex at A, and of which the base is equal to a rectangle contained by Mm and RT; for the point Μ moving parallel to the point R, it will describe a line equal to that described by R, namely, to RT.

Let AM = f, the angle MAR = ô, and the angle OAQ -d<ρ∙, then Mm = fdô, and TR = AR × dφ =∕cos∙ ô . d<ρ. Wherefore B = base of the pyramid described by MAm ~d<ρ.d0 cos. ô .f' 2 , and the direct attraction of the pyramid in the direction AM = -y- (22) = dφ . dô cos. ∂ .f. Wherefore the elementary attraction of the spheroid in the direc-

Again, let MR = x, RS = y, CS = z, CP = h, and AC = h! ; then (Def. 1)

a? 2 y' 2 + z 2 ^W + h! 2 ~ '

But x —f sin. ô, y = AR. sin. φ =∕cos. Ô sin. φ, and z — h' — f cos. û cos. φ ; wherefore, by substitution, we get ∕ 2 sin. 2 ô ,f 2 cos. 2 ô sin. 2 ţ> . (h' — f cos. ô cos.p) 2 _ h 2 + h f2 ^ t ^ hl 2 “ *

From this equation we get ∕= 2h' . c0s, 0 c0s, φ cos. 2 d + -τxsin. 2 ∂ ’ h 2

25. An oblate spheroid of revolution being given, it is required to find the measures of the attractive forces that urge a particle placed anywhere in the surface, in a direction per. pendicular to the axis, and in a direction parallel to it.

Let h and k' be the semiaxes of the ellipse, by the revolution of which the spheroid is described, k being the axis about which it revolves; and let b be the perpendicular distance of the particle from the axis, and a its distance from the plane, drawn through the centre at right angles to the axis: then, from what was proved in (20) and (21), the attractions sought will be found by multiplying the attractions at the pole, and at the circular section equally distant from both poles, by y and yy.

Thus we get the attraction in the direction of a equal to 3M r a × -. . Γe — arc. tan. el, k.e 3 ∙ j and the attraction in the direction of b equal to 7 3M s e 1

ix a^T arc ∙ tan ∙ e ~T+M∙

The same formulae likewise serve for finding the attractions upon a particle placed anywhere within the spheroid. For the attraction upon a particle within the spheroid is equal to the attraction of a similar concentric spheroid, which contains the particle in its surface (9); and it is evident that the co-efficients which multiply a and b in the above expressions depend only upon the proportion of k and k', and they are therefore the same for all similar spheroids.

If we denote by A and B the co-efficients of a and b in the expressions of the attractive force found above, the whole attraction of the spheroid, which is compounded of the forces a . A and b . B, will be = v z α⅛A 2 + Z. 2 B 2 . And if Ύ denote the angle which the direction of this force makes with a, or with the∙axis of the spheroid; then b . B tan. T = r .

Cor. In the very same manner we may determine the attractions of an oblong spheroid of revolution, upon a point in the surface, or within the solid.

26. If k, k', k', the semiaxes of a homogeneous ellipsoid, be related to h, h', h", those of another ellipsoid of the same matter, so that k f2 — Id — li 2 — h 2 and h" 2 — k 2 =. h" 2 — h 2 , the 'attractions perpendicular to the planes of the principal sections, which the first ellipsoid (Plate CH. fig. 17) exerts upon a point determined by the co-ordinates h sin. m, h' cos. m sin. n, h" cos. m cos. n, respectively parallel to k, k', k", will be to the attractions which, the second ellipsoid exerts upon a point determined by the co-ordinates h sin. m, k' cos. m sin. n, h" cos. m cos. n, respectively parallel to h, h', h'', in the direct proportion of the areas of the principal sections to which th^ attractions are perpendicular.

This proposition is an extension to all elliptical spheroids of what was proved of the sphere in (13). It is here enunciated of the ellipsoid, because the demonstration is not more difficult for that solid than for spheroids of revolution.

Let ABDM be an ellipsoid, the semiaxes of which are BC = h, EC = k', and AC — k" ; and abdm another ellipsoid, of which the semiaxes are bc — h, ec — h', and αc = h" ; those quantities being so related that 7f 2 — k 2 zzh β — h 2 , and k" 2 ~h 2 ∙ = ∕√'2 _ Ä 2 a1s0j let g be a point about the ellipsoid ABDM, so determined that GH, parallel to BC, = h sin. m ; HK, parallel to CE, = h' cos. rn [7:4:183] sin. n; and CK = Ä" cos. in cos. n; and let g be a point about the ellipsoid abdm, so determined that gh, parallel t 0 įc = h sin. m ; hh, parallel to ce, = lι , cos. m sin. n ; an ð ck — h" coS. in ċos. n. Then the force with which the ellipsoid ABDM attracts a particle placed at G in the direction GH, will be to the force with which the ellipsoid abdm attracts a particle placed at g in the direction gh, as the area of the section AEDM to the area of the section aedm, or as k t h" to h , h"∙

It is plain, from what has been shown, that, when ∂ varies and φ remains constant in the expressions of the coordinates, the points P and p will move along CM and cm,

Upon the quadrilaterals S and S' let upright prisms RS and rs be erected, and be prolonged to meet the surfaces of the spheroids; join GR, GS, gr, gs. Then,

GR 2 = (h sin. m — k sin.0) 2 + (h , cos. m sin. n — h ’ cos. ð siη.φ) 2 .

And, by expanding these expressions, we get

GR 2 = [(7z 2 + (7f 2 — 7t 2 ) cos. 2 m sin. 2 n +

(7z" 2 — h 2 ) cos. 2 m cos. 2 n) j f(k 2 +(T 2 — h 2 ^) cos. 2 đ sin. 2 ç>+ (h η2 — 7i 2 ) cos. 2 ∂ cos. 2 <p~) — 2 (hh sin. m sin. Ô + h! h! cos. m cos. ô sin. η sin. tp

These expressions are equal, because A' 2 — — hf, and ā" 2 — ā 2 = h! , 2 — 7 i 2 . w herefore RG = rg —f. And, m like manner, it is shown, that GS = gs -f∙

Now, the attraction of the prism RS urging a particle at G in the direction GH, is equal to S × (10); and the attraction of the prism rs urging a particle at g in the direction øŵ, is = S'× —jĻļ: wherefore these attractions are to one another as S to S', or as h ’ k" toΛ'7√'. The same thing may be proved of all the elementary prisms that make up the two portions of the ellipsoids contained between the planes BCM, BCN, and bcm, bcn ; wherefore those portions attract particles placed at G and g, with forces proportional to h r h” and h! Å". But the two ellipsoids may be divided into an equal number of such portions; wherefore the ellipsoids attract particles placed at G and g, in the directions GH and gh, with forces proportional to 7r' h" and h ’ h", or to the sections AMDE and amde. Cor. 1. This proposition is true when the law of attraction is expressed by any function of the distance. The demonstration is the same as in the corollary of (13).

Cor. 2. If the two ellipsoids be so placed that their centres, and the planes of their principal sections, shall coincide, the surface of the one will be entirely within the other. Also the point which one ellipsoid attracts will be in the surface of the other, as is plain from the expressions of the co-ordinates. And hence the attraction of one ellipsoid upon a point without the surface is made to depend upon the attraction of another ellipsoid upon a point within the surface.

Cor. 3. When the ellipsoids become spheroids of revolution, the two principal sections through the axis of revolution become equal, and will be represented by^ any two sections whatever passing through the axis at right angles to one another. But, in this case, the attractions of the spheroids on the points may be reduced to two, one acting perpendicular to the axis, and one parallel to it; and it is plain that these attractions will be to one another as the areas of the sections perpendicular to their directions.

27. To find the attraction of an oblate spheroid upon a particle placed without the surface.

Let k ’ be the radius of the equator, and h the axis of revolution; and let a be the perpendicular distance of the point without the spheroid from the plane of the equator, and b its distance from the axis. In the first place, it is necessary to determine the semiaxĩs of another oblate spheroid that shall contain the given point in its surface, and such, that it shall have the same centre, and its equator in the same plane, as the given spheroid; and likewise the difference of the squares of its semiaxes equal to the difference of the squares of the semiaxes of the given spheroid. Let 7t' denote the radius of the equator, and h the semiaxis of the required spheroid; then, because the attracted point is to be in the surface of the ct^ , solid, we have - τ ≈ + -τ≈ =≡ 1; and, because ∕i 2 n 2 h! 2 — h 2 = hh 2 — h 2 =s 2 , we get « 2 δ 2 _ IP + 7i 2 — i i ~ 1:

Whence,

2 h 2 = a 2 + F — S 2 + √(α 2 + ⅛ 2 — ? 2 ) 2 + 4α 2 ≡ 2 ; and when h is determined, then h ’ = √Λ 2 + s 2 .

In consequence of the equation -χ⅛+ 4⅛ = we ma T suppose a — h sin. m, and b = 7f cos. m ; let a! t=zh sin. m i h k ’ and V — li cos. m ; or a ’ = a, and V =: × b .∙ then the point determined by the co-ordinates a' and bt will be in the surface of the given spheroid, and consequently [7:4:184] it will be within the surface of the other spheroid. Let Μ' denote the mass of the spheroid of which the axis is ļft ∕.2 Íļ2 ∕>2

h; and let e z2 = f5 — = r 2 —: then (25) the attrac-
