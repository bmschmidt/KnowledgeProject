AVELLINO, a large town of the Principato-Ultra, in [7:4:250] the kingdom of Naples, about 25 miles to the eastward of the metropolis. It is the see of a bishop, and contains many churches, though with nothing peculiarly striking except some most grotesque ornaments. It is a manufacturing town of some consequence, and eminent for its blue cloth, the dyeing of which forms the patrimony of a princely family. The soil around is fertile, and provisions of all kinds are very abundant. The population amounts to 13,460 persons.
