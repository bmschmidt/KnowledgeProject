Auditor of the Receipts is an officer of the exchequer who files the tellers’ bills, makes an entry of them, and gives the lord treasurer a certificate of the money receiv [7:4:190] ed the week before. He also makes debentures to every teller before they receive any money, and takes their accounts.

AUDITORS of the Revenue, or of the exchequer, officers who take the accounts of those who collect the revenues and taxes raised by parliament.

AUDITORS of the Prest and Imprest, officers of the exchequer, who received and made up the accounts-of any money impressed to any man for the king’s service. They received poundage on all accounts passed by them; but the office is now abolished.
