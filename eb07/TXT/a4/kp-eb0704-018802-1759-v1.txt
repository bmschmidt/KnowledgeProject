AUBAINE, in the old customs of France, a right vested in the king, by virtue of which he claimed the inheritance of all foreigners that died within his dominions, notwithstanding any testamentary settlement made by the deceased. An ambassador was not subject to the right of aubaine; and the Swiss, Savoyards, Scots, and Portuguese[7:4:189], were also exempted. This ancient privilege of the crown was abolished in 1819.

• AUBE, a department of France, deriving its name from ' that of the chief river by which it is watered. It is bounded on the north by the department of the Marne, on the east by that of the Upper Marne, on the south-east by that of the Côte d’Or, on the south-west by that of the Yonne, and on the north-west by that of the Seine and theMarne. It extends over 2400 square miles or 1,536,000 acres, is tolerably productive in corn and wine, and breeds a considerable number of sheep. At the last census its inhabitants were 244,720, who work some iron mines, and manufacture silk, linen, and woollen goods, together with glass, paper, and leather. The department returns two deputies to the legislative assembly. It is divided into five arrondissements or circles. The chief city is Troyes.
