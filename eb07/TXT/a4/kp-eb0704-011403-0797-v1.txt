ATHENODORUS, a famous Stoic philosopher, bom' at Tarsus, went to the court of Augustus, and was made by him tutor to Tiberius. Augustus had a great esteem for him, and found him by experience a man of virtue and probity. He used to speak very freely to the emperor, and before he left the court to return home, warned him against giving way to anger, but whenever he should be in a passion, to rehearse the 24 letters of the alphabet before he resolved to say or do any thing. He did not live to see his bad success in the education of Tiberius.
