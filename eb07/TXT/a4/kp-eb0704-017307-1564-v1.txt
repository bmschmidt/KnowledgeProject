ATTRACTION.

The word Attraction is used to denote what we observe when one body approaches another, or tends to approach it, without any apparent impulse or other cause to which the motion can be ascribed.

We have instances of attraction when iron approaches the magnet, when certain bodies are placed near an excited electric, and when a stone falls to the earth. We say likewise that the earth attracts the moon; by this mode of expression meaning no more than that the moon is continually deflected towards the earth, from the rectilineal course which it would otherwise pursue. It is likewise in this sense that we must be understood when we say that the sun attracts all the planets.

In the instances already mentioned, attraction extends to a distance. In other cases it is confined within limits so extremely narrow as to become imperceptible at an interval which cannot be appreciated by the senses. Of this kind is the attraction which takes place between the particles of the same fluid, as is apparent from the round figure of small drops. To this class likewise belongs the attraction between fluid and solid bodies; whence originate the very interesting appearances observed in capillary tubes, and other kindred phenomena. An attraction between the small elementary particles of all solid bodies is manifest from the force with which they cohere or resist an endeavour to separate them. In many cases the intensity of this force is prodigiously great in contact or at the nearest distances; while it ceases to act upon making the smallest separation between the parts. Lastly, chemistry developes innumerable instances of attraction between the molecules of the bodies about which it is conversant; insomuch that it is to this principle, under the name of affinity, that we must ultimately ascribe the various decompositions and new combinations which occur m that science.

All these phenomena, although very different from one another in other respects, have yet this in common, that we observe in certain bodiea a tendency to approach one another, and to resist a separation, with some degree of force. The facts are certain, and are attended with no ambiguity; and it is to express these facts that the term attraction is used in physics.

We likewise observe, in some bodies, a tendency to fly off from one another when they are brought near. This is called repulsion.

The word force has, in general, some degree of obscurity. It is used to denote the cause of motion; but we have no direct knowledge of it, and we judge of its intensity by the effect which we suppose it to produce. In all our reasoning concerning forces, it is the changes of motion which we measure and compare together, and which are really the subjects of our thoughts. Attraction and repulsion are forces or principles of motion, known to us only by the phenomena we observe; but the circumstance of their implying action at a distance is an additional source of obscurity in which other kinds of force do not participate.

It certainly is inconceivable that motion should be produced at a distance, when no connection can be traced between the body moved and that which is supposed to produce the motion. We are strongly impressed with the prejudice, that a body cannot act but where it is; and we find difficulty in admitting that the mere presence of two bodies, without the intervention of any mechanical means, can be a satisfactory cause of motion. On this account attraction has been classed by some with the occult qualities of the schools; and the favourers of this doctrine have been reproached with reviving exploded notions in philosophy. Impulse is a principle of motion more familiar to us, and to which we are not disposed to make equal objection. W’henever the communication of motion can be traced to this source, we are satisfied that the effect is justly explained. Hence many philosophers have been of opinion, that impulse is the only cause of motion that can [7:4:174] be admitted in physical science; and many attempts have accordingly been made to reduce to this principle all cases in which distant bodies act on one another. With regard to these attempts, it will be sufficient to remark here, that they are all built upon hypothesis. No evidence is adduced to prove that such things exist as the elastic ether or gravific matter which they set out with supposing. And, as far as such systems have no other object than to obviate the difficulty of action at a distance, this argument alone is sufficient to confute them, without adverting to the difficulties that attend each of them separately, their inconsistency with the received laws of motion, and the innumerable contradictions and improbabilities to which they are liable on every side.

A little reflection is sufficient to show that, in reality, we have no clearer notion of impulse as the cause of motion than we have of attraction. We can as little give a satisfactory reason why motion should pass out of one body into another on their contact, as we can, why one body should begin to move, or have its motion increased, when it is placed near another body. It is equally impossible in both cases to prove that there is a necessary connection between the related facts; and in this respect both the phenomena are alike inexplicable.

When motion is produced by impulse, it is probably the circumstance of contact apparently taking place which leads us to think that the effect is so clearly explained. It is in this manner only, or by actual contact, that we ourselves can move external objects. We have no power of producing motion in distant bodies, except by the intervention of other bodies on which we act immediately. Impulse is, therefore, a cause of motion familiar to us, and strikes us as the plainest and most satisfactory ultimate principle at which we can arrive. On the other hand, when one body attracts another at a distance, there is nothing familiar to us with which we can compare it; our curiosity is excited, and we are led to seek out some hidden connection between them.

But it may be doubted whether there is actual contact in any case of the communication of motion. When a body is impelled by the air, it will hardly be affirmed that the particles of that elastic fluid are in contact with one another, since there is no space, however small, within which a given bulk of it may not be compressed, by applying an external force sufficiently great. The particles of air, therefore, act on one another at a distance; and the same thing must be true of all other elastic fluids. And, by the way, what is here said is sufficient to prove, that no scheme, founded on the hypothesis of an elastic ether, will enable us to account for attraction; because such a contrivance can do nothing more than substitute one species of action at a distance instead of another. There is good reason to think that absolute contact never takes place in the component parts of the hardest and most compact solid bodies. This seems to be an unavoidable consequence of the fact, well established by experience, that all bodies contract in their bulk by cold, and expand by heat. It is therefore not only not impossible, but it is even in some degree probable, that the communication of motion may, in every instance, be a case of action at a distance.

If, then, we are apt to think that impulse is a clearer physical principle than attraction, there is in reality no good ground for the distinction; it has its origin in prejudice, and in our mistaking the proper object of natural philosophy. All our researches in nature are confined to the phenomena we observe, and to the laws by which they are regulated. A physical cause is no other than a general fact discovered by a careful observation and an attentive comparison of many particular and subordinate facts. We have no evidence, independent of ex√ perience, that any consequence, deduced from a physical ' cause, will actually take place. There is in this case no necessary connection from which we can, with absolute certainty, infer the expected event. If, then, we regard impulse and attraction as principles founded in fact, and regulated by laws confirmed by observation and experiment, they are both equally entitled to be classed as physical causes, and they ought both to be admitted as of equal authority in explaining the phenomena of the universe.

If we turn our attention to the different kinds of attraction enumerated above, and inquire what progress has been made in the investigation of their laws of action, we shall find that, generally speaking, this branch of physics has been little advanced. We are very imperfectly acquainted with magnetical and electrical attraction. We know still less of those attractive powers which take place at small distances, and which are confined within such narrow limits that their mode of action escapes the observation of our senses. Attraction is, indeed, much used by philosophers to account for many important natural phenomena; but their explanations are often vague, and destitute of that precision which ought always to be aimed at in physical science. There is only one class of phenomena in which the laws of attraction have been fully developed. We allude to gravitation, that principle which occasions the fall of heavy bodies at the surface of the earth, and which retains the planets and comets in their orbits. Referring the other species of attraction, which are little susceptible of general discussion, to their several heads, we shall now confine our attention to gravitation

Traces of the principle of gravitation are to be found] in writers of great antiquity; but their speculations on ( this subject do not go beyond a vague notion of a tendent cy which the planets have to one another, or to a common centre. It would contribute little either to entertainment or instruction to collect all the passages of ancient authors that speak of this principle. The revival of the true system of the world by Copernicus introduced the most admirable simplicity in the explanation of the planetary motions, and likewise led to more just conjectures concerning the laws by which they are upheld. Copernicus himself attributed the round figure of the planets to a tendency which their parts possess of uniting with one another, thus extending to all the planets that attraction which we observe at the surface of the earth. He stopt short indeed at this point, conceiving attraction to be confined to the matter of each planet, without making it extend from one planet to another, so as to actuate all the bodies of the system. This step was made by the bold and systematic genius of Kepler. Adopting the opinion of Dr Gilbert of Colchester, that the earth is a great magnet, Kepler formed to himself a notion of attraction, in some respects remarkably just. He says that the earth and moon attract one another, and, were it not for some powers which retain them in their orbits, they would move towards one another, and would meet in their common centre of gravity. He attributes the tide to the moon’s attraction (virtus tractoria quae in luna est), which heaps up the waters of the ocean immediately under her. But in many respects his notions of attraction were fanciful and extravagant; a more perfect knowledge of the laws of motion than had been attained to in his time, and a new geometry, were both wanting in order to guide him in this research without danger of wandering. Yet he was able to penetrate so far into the causes of the planetary motions, as to foresee that they would not long continue latent; and he tells us, he was persuaded that “the full discovery of those mysteries was reserved for the next age, when God [7:4:175] would reveal them.” ' So full an exposition of a physical system of the world as is contained in the writings of Kepler could not fail to draw the attention of succeeding philosophers. Many remarks concerning the principle of gravitation arc to be found in the writings of Fermat, Roberval, Borelli, and other authors; but no one before Newton entertained so clear and systematic a view of the doctrine of universal gravitation as Dr Robert Hooke. In his work on the motion of the earth, published in 1674, twelve years before the appearance of Newton’s Principia, he lays down these three positions as the foundations of his system, viz. :—

« Isŕ, That all the heavenly bodies have not only a gravitation of their parts to their own proper centre, but likewise that they mutually attract each other within their spheres of action.

« 2dly, That all bodies having a simple motion will continue to move in a straight line, unless continually deflected from it by some extraneous force, causing them to describe a circle, or an ellipse, or some other curve.

“ 3dly, This attraction is so much the greater as the bodies are nearer.”

The principle of universal gravitation is here very precisely enunciated. Dr Hooke seems to have clearly perceived that the planetary motions are the result of an attraction towards the sun, and of a rectilineal motion produced by a projectile force. Not having discovered the law according to which the force diminishes as the distance from the sun increases, he contrived experiments to elucidate his theory. Having suspended a ball by means of a long thread, he placed another ball upon a table immediately under the point of suspension, and he caused the suspended ball to revolve round the stationary one. When the movable ball was pushed laterally with a force properly adjusted to its deviation from the perpendicular, it described an exact circle round the ball on the table: in other cases it described an ellipse, or an oval resembling an ellipse, having the other ball in the centre. Dr Hooke observed, that although this experiment in some measure illustrated the planetary motions, yet it did not represent them accurately; because the ellipses which the planets describe have the sun placed in one focus, and not in the centre. Thus, at the appearance of Newton, many things were known, or rather surmised, that prepared the way for the discovery of the principle which regulates the celestial motions. This does not detract in any degree from the glory of Newton, who, discarding the conjectures of his predecessors, proposed to himself to investigate, with mathematical strictness, the law of the attractive force, and to ascertain with precision its sufficiency to retain the planets in their orbits. He invented a new kind of geometry, which was necessary to enable him to accomplish his purpose. With this help, and by admitting nothing without the sanction of the established principles of Dynamics, he deduced from the motions of the celestial bodies the law of universal gravitation, the most important and the most general truth hitherto discovered by the industry and the sagacity of man, viz. “that all the particles of matter attract one another, directly as their masses, and inversely as the squares of their distances.”

Having arrived at a principle which belongs to every part of matter, another inquiry comes into view. Setting out from this principle, it is now necessary to proceed in an inverted order, and deduce from it, by synthetical reasoning, the phenomena which we observe in the universe. The first step in this process is to find out the attractive force of the planets, which arises from the united attractions of their component parts. Two things only are involved in this investigation, viz. the known law of attraction between the particles of matter, and the figure of the attracting bodies. This is a subject of great importance, and it is connected with some principal points of the system of the world, with the theory of the figure of the planets, that of the tides, and many other phenomena. It is but imperfectly discussed in Newton’s immortal work; and there is no part of his philosophy which has been improved more slowly by the labours of his followers. We now propose to treat of it at some length, endeavouring to lay before our readers as complete a view of this part of science as the nature of our work will permit.

We begin with laying down some definitions, and demonstrating some properties, of elliptical spheroids.

Def. 1. A solid generated by the revolving of an ellipse about either axis is called a spheroid of revolution. If the ellipse revolve about the less axis, the spheroid is oblate; if about the greater axis, it is oblong.

Let k and h! denote the two axes of the spheroid, k being that of revolution; and let x and y be two co-ordinates of a point in the surface of the spheroid, having their origin in the centre, x being parallel to the axis of revolution, and y perpendicular to it; then the equation of the spheroid, whether oblate or oblong, will be £ + £-ı

∕ i 2 τ V 2 ~

Def. 2. An elliptical spheroid, in general, or an ellipsoid, is a solid bounded by a finite surface of the second order. Let ACB and ADE (Plate CL fig. 1: this figure represents one eighth of an ellipsoid contained in one of the solid angles formed by the three principal sections) be two ellipses that have the same axis AO, the same centre 0, and their planes perpendicular to one another: from any point K in the common axis, let there be drawn ordinates in both ellipses, as KC and KD; then, having described an ellipse of which KC and KD are the semiaxes, the periphery DMC of that ellipse will be in the surface of the ellipsoid. This solid figure has a centre, three axes crossing one another at right angles in the centre, and three principal sections made by planes passing through every two of its axes.

Let h, hl, k", denote the three semiaxes, viz. h — OB, h' = OE, h" = OA; and let x, y, z, denote three rectangular co-ordinates of a point Μ in the surface, the co-ordinates being parallel to the axes, and having their origin in the centre, viz. MN = x, NK = y, and OK = z ; then

^∕2 g2 the equation of the surface will be z - -ļ- + ~~E^ ’ 2 — » as it is easy to prove from the foregoing construction.

The ellipsoid becomes a sphere when all the three axes are equal: it becömes a spheroid of revolution when two of them are equal.

1. If any plane cut an elliptical spheroid, the section will he an ellipse. In the spheroid of revolution, a section made by a plane perpendicular io the axis of revolution is a circle. All this follows so easily from the nature of the. solids, that we need not stop to give a formal demonstration.

2. If a straight line cut two concentric ellipses that are similar and similarly situated, the parts of it between the outer and inner peripheries are equal to one another.

Let AHBK and MDNC (Plate CI. fig. 2) be two similar and similarly situated ellipses that have the same centre 0; and let the straight line AB cut them both; then AC and BD are equal. Bisect CD in∙L, and through L and the common centre draw the straight line HMNK to cut both ellipses. Because the ellipses are similar and similarly situated, and that CD is an ordinate of the diameter MN, it is plain that AB will be an ordinate of the diameter HK; wherefore, AB and CD being both bisected, in L, AC is equal to BD.
[7:4:176]

3. If there be two ellipses, one within the other, such that, any straight line being drawn to cut them, the parts of it between their peripheries are equal to one another, these ellipses are concentric, similar, and similarly situated.

Let D (fig. 2) be any point in the inner ellipse, and through D draw EF, terminating in the outer ellipse: then, if we make FG = DE, G must be a point in the inner ellipse. Hence all the points of the inner curve are determined when the outer ellipse and the point D are given: wherefore there cannot be two different curves, both passing through D, that will answer the conditions. But an ellipse described through D, concentric with the outer ellipse, and similar to it, and similarly situated, will answer the conditions (2). Wherefore the two ellipses are concentric, and similar, and similarly situated.

4. If a straight line be drawn to cut two elliptical spheroids that have the same centre, and are similar and similarly situated, the part of it between the outer and inner surfaces will be equal to one another.

Conceive a plane, which contains the straight line, to pass through the common centre of the solids: the sections made by the plane will be concentric ellipses (1); and these will be similar and similarly situated, because the solids are so: wherefore the parts of the straight line between the surfaces are equal (2).

5. If two elliptical spheroids that have the same centre, and are similar and similarly situated, be cut by a plane, the two sections will be concentric ellipses that are similar and similarly situated.

For the sections are ellipses (1); and, any straight line being drawn to cut them, the parts of it between the peripheries will be equal (4). Wherefore the ellipses are concentric, similar, and similarly situated (3).

6. Let ADE and CFG (fig. 3) be two concentric ellipses that are similar and similarly situated ; let A 0 and C0, in the same straight line, be two of their axes, and let DE, drawn through C, be perpendicular to AO ; then if CF and CG be two chords of the interior ellipse that make equal angles with the axis CO, and if the chords DM and DNof the exterior ellipse be drawn respectively parallel to CF and CG ; the sum of CF and CG will be equal to the sum or difference of DM and DN, according as they both fall on the same side, or on different sides of DE.

For draw EP parallel to CF, and it will likewise be parallel to DM. Because CF and CG are equally inclined to CO and to DE, it is plain that DN and EP, which are parallel tó CF and CG, are likewise equally inclined to DE: consequently DN = EP. Draw a straight line through the common centre to bisect DM in L, and that straight line will likewise bisect EP, parallel to DM, in H: and because the ellipses are similar and similarly situated, the same straight line will likewise bisect the chord CF of the interior ellipse, in K. Because DC = CE, therefore DL + EH = 2CK = CF. Wherefore DM + DN= 2DL + 2EH = 2CF = CF + CG.

The demonstration of the other case, when DM and DN fall on different sides of DE, is entirely similar.

Some general Properties, resulting from the Law of Attraction that obtains in Nature.

7. Let AB and EF (fig. 4) be two indefinitely slender pyramids, that are similar to one another, and both composed of the same homogeneous matter, which attracts in the inverse proportion of the square of the distance : the attractions of the pyramids upon particles placed at the vertices A and E are proportional to the length of the pyramids.

Conceive each of the pyramids to be divided into an indefinitely great number of thin slices of equal thickness, by planes parallel to its base; then, if CD and GH be any two of these slices, their attractions upon particles placed at A and E will be proportional to and Sä,: Now JAC -ts(jn these are equal; for the solids CD and GH having the same thickness, they are proportional to the sections CM and GN, that is, to AC 2 and EG 2 , because the pyramids are similar. Wherefore the attraction of any one of the slices in the pyramid AB, upon a particle placed at A, is equal to the attraction of any one of the slices in EF upon a particle placed at E. Consequently, the whole attraction of the pyramid AB is to the whole attraction of the pyramid EF as the number of slices in AB ţo the number of slices in EF, that is, as the length AB to the length EF.

Car. 1. The attractions of any portions of the pyramid are as the lengths of the portions. For the attractions are proportional to the number of slices in the portions, that is, as the lengths.

Cor. 2. If the pyramids have different densities, their attractions are proportional to the lengths multiplied by the densities. For, in this case, the attraction of each slice will be proportional to its density; wherefore the attractions will be as the densities multiplied by the number of slices, or as the densities multiplied by the lengths.

8. If there be two similar solids composed of tlιe same homogeneous matter, which attracts in the inverse proportion of the square of the distance ; any two particles of matter, similarly situated with regard to the solids, will be attracted by them with forces that are proportioned to any of the homologous lines of the solids.

Because the solids are similar, they may be resolved into an indefinitely great number of slender pyramids, and frustums of pyramids, that are similar to one another, and similarly placed in the solids; each pyramid having its vertex at one of the attracted particles. The direct attractions of any corresponding pair of pyramids will have constantly the same ratio to one another; for they will be as the lengths of the pyramids or frustums (7); that is, because the solids are similar, as any two homologous lines of the solids. Wherefore the whole attractive forces, compounded of all the direct attractions which act in directions that make the same angles with one another, will likewise have to one another the proportion of any two of the homologous lines of the solids.

Cοr. If the two solids have different densities, their attractions will be proportional to the densities multiplied by any homologous lines of the solids (7, Cor. 2).

9. If there be two concentric elliptical spheroids that are similar and similarly situated, a particle placed anywhere within the inner surface will be in equilibrium, or will be urged equally in all opposite directions by the shell of homogeneous matter contained between the two surfaces, supposing the law of attraction to be that of the inverse proportion of the square of the distance.

Let P (Plate CH. fig. 5) be a particle placed within such a shell, and let a slender double pyramid, having P for the common vertex, be extended to meet the surfaces of the solid on both sides of P. The portions of the pyramid AGHB and CEFD between the surfaces on opposite sides of P, will have equal lengths (4); wherefore these portions will attract a particle placed at Pwith equal forces (7, Cor. 1). The same thing maybe proved of all the pyramids which have their vertices at P, and fill the spheroids. Wherefore P is attracted equally in all opposite directions by the homogeneous matter contained between the surfaces of the spheroids.

10. To find the attractive force of an indefinitely slender prism, acting in α direction parallel to the prism, upon α particle of matter placed anywhere.

Let BC (Plate CH. fig. 6) be a prism of homogeneous matter, upon the indefinitely slender base CH, and [7:4:177] .let a particle of matter be placed at A; draw AB and AC to the extremities of the prism, and AE to any point in it ∙ and draw AD perpendicular to BC. Let S = base CH, and put AD = «, DE = x ; the element of the prism is = S × ⅛ the element of the attraction in the direc-

and the constant quantity is determined by making the fluent begin at the end of the prism nearer to A; wherefore the whole attractive foree of the prism, in the direction parallel to the prism, is = S × {āb ~ Āō}’

Cor. In like manner may the attractive foree of the prism be found, when the attraction of the particles is proportional to any function of the distance.

Let AB = f AC ~f'∙, suppose that φ (f) is the function of the distance that expresses the law of attraction; and put sdf. <p (∕) = Ψ (/); then the attraction parallel to the prism is = s×± [γ (∕)-ψ(∕')l.. observing that the attraction is always positive.
