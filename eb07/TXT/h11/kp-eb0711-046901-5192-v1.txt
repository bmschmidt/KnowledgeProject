HISPANIA, called Hesperia Ultima, as being the westernmost part of Europe, and also Iberia, from the river Iberus. The name Hispania is of Phoenician origin, the Phoenicians, who settled several colonies on the coast, calling it Spαnjαh, from the great number of rabbits in the country. It has the sea on every side, except on that next to Gaul, from which it is separated by the Pyrenees. The Romans at first divided it into the Farther and Hither Spain, which were governed by two praetors. In that state it continued till the time of Augustus, who divided Farther Spain into Baetica, which he left to be governed by a proconsul, and into Lusitania, which he added to his own provinces; calling Hither Spain Tarraconensis. Hispania was anciently celebrated for its fertility. The people were of a warlike turn; and their bodies being formed for hardships and labour, they preferred war to p>ace, and were remarkably prodigal of life.
