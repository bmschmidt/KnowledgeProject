HORNCASTLE, a town and parish of the county of Lincoln, in Lindsey Division, 136 miles from London. It stands on the river Bane, in a valley which at seasons is nearly overflowed. It was an ancient Roman station, and some of the walls constructed by the Romans are still visible. There is a medicinal spring near the town, but it is not much applied to. There is a good market, which is held on Saturday. A canal has been constructed, which connects the river Bane with the Witham. The population amounted in 1801 to 2015, in 1811 to 2622, in 1821 to 3058, and in 1831 to 3988.
