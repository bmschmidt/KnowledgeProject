HERMAS, an ecclesiastical author of the first century, and, according to Origen, Eusebius, and Jerome, the same whom St Paul salutes in the end of his epistle to the Romans. He wrote a book in Greek some time before Do-mitĩan’s persecution, which happened in the year 95. This work is entitled The Pastor, from his representing an angel speaking to him in it under the form of a shepherd. The Greek text is lost, but a very ancient Latin version is still extant. Some of the fathers have considered this* book as canonical. The best edition of it is that of 1698, where it is to be found amongst the other apostolical fathers, illustrated with the notes and corrections of Cotelerius and Le Clerc. It was translated into English by Archbishop Wake.
