HORDICALIA, or Hordicidia, in Antiquity, a religious feast amongst the Romans, in which they sacrificed cattle large with young. This feast fell on the 15th of April, on which day they sacrificed thirty cows with calf to the goddess Tellus, or the Earth, part of them being immolated in the temple of Jupiter. The calves taken out of their bellies were burned to ashes, at first by the pontifices, but afterwards by the eldest of the vestal virgins.
