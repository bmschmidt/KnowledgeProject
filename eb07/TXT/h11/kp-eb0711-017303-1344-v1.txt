HAWKESBURY, a river of New Holland, which falls into Broken Bay, on the east coast. It is a large river, having its rise among the Blue Mountains far into the interior, and affording an outlet to the waters of an extensive tract of country. The banks of this river are thickly planted on each side with settlements; and it is navigable for large vessels of about 200 tons to the distance from the sea of about forty miles, and by the turnings of the river 120 miles. The country immediately adjoining the banks of the river is a rich alluvial mould; but beyond this is a stiff soil, composed of sand, earth, and clay, which improves, however, by cultivation. The river is subject to sudden rises after heavy rains, to the height of seventy or eighty feet, and overflows the adjacent country with wide inundations, carrying away flocks and herds, and sometimes the habitations of the settlers.
