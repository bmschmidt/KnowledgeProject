HIPPOCENTAUR (composed of ⅛sχ, horse, «ma, pungo, I spur, and τavgος, bull), in Antiquity, a fabulous monster, supposed to be half horse and half man. The hippocentaurs seem to have differed from the centaurs in this, that the latter only rode on bullocks, and the former on horses, as the names themselves indicate.
