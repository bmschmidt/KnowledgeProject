HERMUS, in Ancient Geography, a river of Ionia, which, risingnear Dorylaeum, a town of Phrygia, in a mountain sacred to Dindymene or Cybele, touched Mysia, and ran through the Pegio Combusta, and then through the plains of Smyrna down to the sea, carrying along with it the Pactolus, Hyllus, and other less notable rivers. Its waters were said, by Virgil and other poets, to roll down gold.
