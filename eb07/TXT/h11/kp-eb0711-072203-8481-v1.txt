HUMILIATI, a congregation of religious persons in the church of Rome, established by some Milanese gentlemen upon their release from prison, where they had been confined under the Emperor Conrad, or, as others say, under[7:11:723] Frederick I. in the year 1162. This order, which acquired great wealth, and had no less than ninety monasteries, was abolished by Pope Pius V. in 1570, for their luxury and cruelty, and their houses given to the Dominicans and Cordeliers.
