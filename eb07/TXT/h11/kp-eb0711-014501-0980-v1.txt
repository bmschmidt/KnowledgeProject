HARANGUE, a modern French term for a speech or oration made by an orator in public. Menage derives the word from the Italian arenga, which signifies the same thing, and is formed, according to Ferrari, from arringo i a joust, or place of jousting. Others derive it from the Latin Î±ra, an altar, by reason of the first harangues having been made before altars. s The word is also frequently used in a bad sense, for a pompous, prolix, or unseasonable speech or declamation.
