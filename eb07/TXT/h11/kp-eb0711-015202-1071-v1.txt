HARPAGINES, in Antiquity, were hooks of iron, hanging on the top of a pole, which being secured with chains to the masts of ships, and then let down with great velocity into the enemy’s vessels, caught them up into the air. By way of defence against these machines, they covered their ships with hides, which broke and blunted the force of the iron. The harpagines, by the Greeks called âf¢rayíř, owe their invention to Anacharsis the Scythian philosopher.
