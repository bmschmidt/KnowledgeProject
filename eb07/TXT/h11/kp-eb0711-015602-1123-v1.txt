HARROWGATE, a township within the parish of Knaresborough, in the wapentake of Claro, of the west riding of Yorkshire, 212 miles from London, and twenty-two from York. It is situated in a cold exposed heath, but is much visited in the summer season, on account of its mineral springs, some of which are chalybeate, and others sulphureous. There are appropriate boarding-houses and taverns, with libraries and a theatre, and the other accommodations usual at a well-frequented watering place.
