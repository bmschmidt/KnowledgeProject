HEAD, the uppermost or foremost part of the body of an animal.

HEAD~Borow, or HEAn-Eσrouph, signifies the person who is the chief of the frank-pledge, and who had anciently the principal direction of those within his own pledge. He was also called burrow-head, burshoulder, now bors-hοlder, third-borrow, tything-man, chief-pledge, and borow-elder, according to the diversity of speech in different places. This officer is now usually called a high-constable. The head-borow was the chief of ten pledges; the other nine were called lιαηd-borrows, or pleaii manuales, and the like.

HEAD-Penxe, an exaction of a certain sum formerly collected by the sheriff of Northumberland from the inhabitants of that county, without any account to be made to the king. This was abolished by the statute 23 Henry VI. cap. 7.

HEAD-Dress, amongst the Jewish, Grecian, and Roman ladies, as amongst ourselves, was various, according to the different periods of time, and the fluctuation of fashion. In general, it consisted principally of their hair differently tricked out. It was usually divided before with a bodkin, into two equal parts; sometimes it was covered with a net, or put into a kind of purse,’ or tied behind in the form of a knot, or bound back and plaited with ribands. It was washed with great care; essence and perfumes were applied to it, and gold dust was sometimes made use of as powder. Pearls and jewels formed part of their ornaments; and pendants were worn in the ears.
