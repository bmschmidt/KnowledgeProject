HAeMUS, Emineh Dag, or BÎ±lcan, a lofty chain of mountains separating Thrace from Moesia, and running from the sources of the Hebrus towards the east of the Black Sea. From its summit, it was said, the Euxine, the Adriatic, the Danube, and the Alps, could be seen at one view; and it was with the intention of beholding this magnificent prospect that Philip king of Macedon ascended the mountain. (Liv. xl. 21; Polyb. xxxiv. 10, 15; Strab. vii. 313.)
