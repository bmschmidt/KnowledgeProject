HALLEIN, a city of the circle of Salzach or Salzburg, in the Austrian province of the Upper Ens. It is situated on the river Salza, and is celebrated for its extensive saltworks, which employ upwards of two thousand workmen, partly in drawing the rock-salt from the mines, and partly in the subsequent process of refining it. As this place is close to the Bavarian frontier, that kingdom draws from thence 13,000 tons of culinary salt, and about 10,000 are furnished to the Austrian dominions. There are some manufactures of hosiery and of cotton goods. It contains three churches, 320 houses, and 4640 inhabitants.
