HUNDRED, Hundredum, or Centuria, a part or division of a county, and anciently so called from its containing an hundred families, or from its furnishing an hundred able men for the king’s wars. After Alfred’s dividing England into counties, and giving the government of each county to a sheriff, these counties were divided into hundreds, of which the constable was the chief officer.
