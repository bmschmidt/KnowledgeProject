HELICOID Parabola, or the Parabolic Spiral, is a curve arising from the supposition that the common or Apollonian parabola is bent or twisted till the axis comes into the circumference of a circle, the ordinates still retaining their places and perpendicular positions with respect[7:11:213] to the circle, and all these lines still remaining in the same plane.
