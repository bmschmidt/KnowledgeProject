HAMELN, a city of the kingdom of Hanover, in the province of Kalenberg. It stands on the river Weser, where that stream receives the water of the Hamel. It is surrounded by walls scarcely defensible; and the citadel of Fort George was destroyed by the French in 1806. It contains 674 houses, and 5454 inhabitants. There are some very large breweries, and several tanneries; and some linen goods are also made. The navigation of the Weser was dangerous near this place, but the danger has been removed by the erection of new locks.
