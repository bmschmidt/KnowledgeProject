HEMI, a word employed in the composition of different terms. It signifies the same with semi or demi, viz. half; being an abbreviate of ⅛μufaς, which signifies the same thing. The Greeks retrenched the last syllable of the word ⅛μusυς in the composition of words; and, after their example, we have done so too in most of the compounds borrowed from them.
