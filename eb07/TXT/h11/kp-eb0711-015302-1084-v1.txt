HARPOCRATES, in Mythology, the son of Isis and Osiris, an Egyptian deity, whose distinguishing attribute it is, that he is represented with his fingers applied to his mouth* denoting that he is the god of silence. The statue of this idol was fixed in the entrance of most of the Egyptian temples, and he was commonly exhibited under the figure of a young man naked, crowned with an Egyptian mitre, holding in one hand a cornucopia, in the other the flower of the lotus, and sometimes bearing a quiver.
