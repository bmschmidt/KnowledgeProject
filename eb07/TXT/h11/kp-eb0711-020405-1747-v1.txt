HECATESIA, a yearly festival observed by the Stratonicensians in honour of Hecate. The Athenians also paid particular worship to this goddess, who was deemed the patroness of families and of children. From this circumstance the statues of the goddess were erected before the doors of the houses; and at every new moon a public supper was provided at the expense of the richest people, [7:11:205] and set in the streets, where the poorest of the citizens were permitted to retire and feast upon it, whilst they reported that Hecate had devoured it. There were also expiatory offerings, to supplicate the goddess to remove whatever evils might impend on the heads of the public.
