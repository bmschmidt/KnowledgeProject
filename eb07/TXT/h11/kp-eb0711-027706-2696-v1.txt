HERMOGENES, the first and most celebrated architect of antiquity, was, according to Vitruvius, born at Al-anbada, a city in Caria. He built a temple of Diana at Magnesia, and another of Bacchus at Tros; and he was the inventor of several parts of architecture. He composed a book on the subject, which is lost.

Hermogenes Tarsensis, a rhetorician and orator, who was in every respect a prodigy. At the age of seventeen he published his system of rhetoric, and at twenty his philosophic ideas; but at twenty-five he forgot every thing he had known. It is said that his body being opened after his death, his heart was found of an extraordinary size, and all covered with hair. He died about 168 before Christ.
