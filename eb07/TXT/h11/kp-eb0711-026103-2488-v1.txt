HERBACEOUS Plants are those which have succulent stems or stalks that die down to the ground every year. Of herbaceous plants, those are annual which perish, stem, root, and all, every year; biennial, which subsist by the roots two years; perennial, which are perpetuated by their roots for a series of years, a new stem being produced every spring.
