HOUNSLOW, a town, part of the parish of Heston, in the hundred of Ossulton and county of Middlesex, ten miles from London. It is on the great western road, and more post-horses are kept there than at any other town in England. Near to it are some considerable powder-mills, and also mills for rolling copper. On what was formerly Hounslow Heath, but now enclosed, there are extensive barracks for cavalry.
