HOOD, Robin, a famous outlaw and deer-stealer, who chiefly harboured in Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire. He was a man of family, and played his pranks about the end of the twelfth century. He was famous for archery, and for his hospitable treatment of all travellers who came in the way; levying contributions on the rich, and relieving the poor. At last, having fallen sick, and requiring to have blood taken, he is said to have been betrayed and bled to death. He died in 1247, and was buried at Kirklees in Yorkshire, then a Benedictine monastery.

Hood, in Falconry, is a piece of leather, with which the head of a hawk, falcon, or the like, is covered. See Falconry. Hood’s Island, the most northerly of the Mendoza’s islands, in the South Pacific Ocean, discovered in 1774 by Captain Cook. Long. 138. 52. W. Lat. 9. 26. S.
