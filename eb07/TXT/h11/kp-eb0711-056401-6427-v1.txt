HORNERS, those people whose business it is to prepare various utensils from the horns of cattle. The homers were a considerable fraternity in the city of London some centuries ago. In the reign of Edward II. they complained to parliament, that by foreigners buying up the horns in England, they were in danger of being ruined, and their business lost to the nation. For this reason was made the statute 6 Edward IV. by which the sale of horns to foreigners, excepting such as the homers refused, was prohibited; and the wardens had powcr granted them to search all the markets in London, and twenty-four miles round, and to inspect Stourbridge and Ely fairs, to prevent such practices, and to purchase horns at stated prices. But on plausible pretences this law was repealed in the reign of James L> [7:11:565] and thereupon the old evil revived. The horners again applied to parliament, and King Edwardâ€™s statute was renewed, excepting as to the inspection of the fairs, and still, it is believed, remains in force.
