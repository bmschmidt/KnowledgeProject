HOMICIDE signifies in general the taking away of the life of a human being. It is of three kinds; justifiable, excusable, and felonious. The first has no share of guilt at all; the second very little; but the third is the highest crime against the law of nature that man is capable of committing. See Penal Jurisprudence.
