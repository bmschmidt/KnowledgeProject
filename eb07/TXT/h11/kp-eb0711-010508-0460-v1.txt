HAeMORRHAGY (compounded of αιμα, blood, and lr l γνω, fιγνυμι, or ģłjtfffw, to break, rend, or force asunder), in medicine, a flux of blood at any part of the body, arising either from a rupture of the vessels, as when they are too full or too much pressed, or from an erosion of the same, as when the blood is too sharp and corrosive. The haemorrhagy, properly speaking, as understood by the Greeks, was only a flux of blood at the nose; but the moderns extend the name to any kind of bloody flux, whether from the nose, mouth, lungs, stomaeh, intestines, fundament, matrix, or any other part.
