HELENUS, one of the sons of Priam, possessing the power of prophecy (Virg. Aen. iii. 295, 712), who distinguished himself by his valour during the Trojan war; but when Helen was given in marriage to Deiphobus, he determined to leave Troy, and retired to Chrysa, or Mount Ida. He was here discovered and taken prisoner by Ulysses. After the taking of Troy we find him the friend or slave of Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, whose favour he had gained by preventing him from embarking in a vessel which sunk with all its passengers. Being tired of Andromache, he gave her as wife to Helenus. On the death of Neoptolemus he became the natural guardian of his son Molossus, and when he came of age, restored to him a part of Epirus, reserving that which he had conquered during his regency. He had by Andromache a son called Cestrinus. (Paus. i. 11, ii. 23.) Here Helenus received Aeneas on his way to Italy, and foretold some of the calamities which threatened him. (Virg. Aen. iii. 295.)
