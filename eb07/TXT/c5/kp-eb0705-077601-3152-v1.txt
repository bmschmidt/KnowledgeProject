CAeSAREA, an ancient city of Palestine, of great celebrity, but now in ruins, and entirely deserted. It is situated on the sea-coast, and had an extraordinary harbour, whieh, according to Josephus, was constructed by Herod. Louis IX. of France is said to have rebuilt its walls during the holy wars. The adjacent ground is eovered to a great extent with numerous and magnificent remains of antiquity. When this country was visited by Pococke, Caesarea was inhabited by a few families; but at the time it was visited by Dr Clarke it was quite deserted. It is 36 miles from Acre, and 62 from Jerusalem.
