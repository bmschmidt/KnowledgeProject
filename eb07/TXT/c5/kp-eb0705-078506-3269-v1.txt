CALATHUS, in antiquity, a kind of hand-basket made of light wood or rushes, used by the women sometimes to gather flowers, but chiefly, after the example of Minerva, to put their work in. The figure of the calathus, as represented on ancient monuments, is narrow at the bottom, but widens upwards like that of a top. Pliny compares it to that of a lily. The calathus or work-basket of Minerva is no less celebrated among the poets than her distaff.

Calathus was also the name of a wine-cup used in sacrifices.
