CALAHORR A, a town of Spain, in the province of Old Castile, and in the district of Soria. It was a city of considerable distinction in past ages, and the vestiges of its grandeur are still visible around it. The vicinity of the place yields a considerable quantity of fine wool. It is on the banks of the little river Yregua, which falls into the Ebro. It is the seat of a bishop, and contains 7200 inhabitants; and there is a beautiful bridge of ten arches over the river. This town was the birth-place of Quintilian.
