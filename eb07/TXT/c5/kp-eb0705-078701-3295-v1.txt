CALCHAS, in fabulous history, a famous diviner, followed the Greek army to Troy. He foretold that the siege would last ten years; and that the fleet, which was detained in the port of Aulis by contrary winds, would not sail till Agamemnonâ€™s daughter had been sacrificed to Diana. After the taking of Troy he retired to Colophon, where, it is said, he died of grief, because he could not divine what another of his profession, called Mopsus, had discovered.
