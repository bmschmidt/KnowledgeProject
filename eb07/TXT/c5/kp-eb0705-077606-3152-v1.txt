CAeSURA, in the ancient poetry, is when, in the scanning of a verse, a word is divided, so that one part seems cut off, and goes to a different foot from the rest.

Caesura, in the modern poetry, denotes a rest or pause towards the middle of an Alexandrine verse, by which the voice and pronunciation are aided, and the verse as it were divided into two hemistichs.
