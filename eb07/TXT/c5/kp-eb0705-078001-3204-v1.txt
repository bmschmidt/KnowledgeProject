CAIROAN, or Cairwan, a city of Africa, in the kingdom of Tunis, seated in a sandy barren soil, about five miles from the Gulf of Capres. It has neither spring, well, nor river; for which reason they are obliged to preserve rain water in tanks and cisterns. It was built by the Aglabites, and was once the seat of a considerable kingdom, but it is now much decayed. There is still, however, a very superb mosque, and the tombs of the kings of Tunis are yet to be seen. Long. 9. 12. E. Lat. 35. 40. E.
