CADUCEUS, in antiquity, Mercuryâ€™s rod or sceptre, being a wand entwisted by two serpents, borne by that deity as the ensign of his quality and office, and, according to the fable, given him by Apollo for his seven-stringed harp. Wonderful properties are ascribed to this rod by the poets; as laying men asleep, raising the dead, and such like marvels. It was also used by the ancients as a symbol of peace and concord. The Romans sent to the Carthaginians a javelin and a caduceus, offering them their choice either of war or peace. Among that people, those who denounced war were called feciales ; and those who went to demand peace, caduceatores, because they bore a caduceus in their hand. The caduceus found on medals is a common symbol, signifying good conduct, peace, and prosperity. The rod expresses power, the two serpents prudence, and the two wings diligence.
