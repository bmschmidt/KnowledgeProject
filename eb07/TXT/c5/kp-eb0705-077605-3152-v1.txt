CAeSTUS, in Antiquity, a large gauntlet made of raw hide, which the wrestlers made use of when they fought at the public games. This was a kind of leathern strap, strengthened with lead or plates of iron, which encompassed the hand, the wrist, and a part of the arm, as well to defend these parts as to enforce their blows.

Caestus, or Coestum, was also a kind of girdle, made of wool, which the husband untied for his soouse the first day of marriage.
