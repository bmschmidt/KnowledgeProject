CABBALISTS, the Jewish doctors who profess the study of the cabbala. In the opinion of these men, there is not a word, letter, nor accent in the law, without some mystery in it. The Jews are divided into two general sects; the Karaites, who refuse to receive either tradition or the Talmud, or any thing but the pure texts of Scripture; and the Rabbinists, or Talmudists, who besides this receive the traditions of the ancients, and follow the Talmud. The latter are again divided into two other sects; pure rabbinists, who explain the Scripture in its natural sense, by grammar, history, and tradition; and cabbalists, who, to discover hidden and mystical senses, which they suppose God to have couched therein, make use of the cabbala and the mystical methods above mentioned.
