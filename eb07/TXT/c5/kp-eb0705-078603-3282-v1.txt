CALCAR, John de, a celebrated painter, was the disciple of Titian, and perfected himself by studying Raphael. Among various pieces, he drew a Nativity, representing the angels around the infant Christ; and so ordered the disposition of his picture as to cause the light to proceed from the child. He died at Naples in 1546, in the flower of his age.
