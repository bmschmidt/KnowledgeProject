CACHALONG, a name given by mineralogists to a peculiar variety of calcedony. It is commonly of a milk-white colour, and translucent, occurring imbedded in the trap rocks of Iceland and Faro, along with calcedony. It is met with also on the borders of the river Cach in Bukharia; whence its designation.
