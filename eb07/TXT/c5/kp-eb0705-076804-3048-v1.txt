CACHAR, a district in Asia, tributary to the Burman empire, and lying about the twenty-fifth degree of north latitude, between that country and Bengal. It is a mountainous and sterile country, bounded on the north by Assam, on the south by the Cassay country, on the east by Cassay, and on the west by the districts of Tipperah and Silhet in the province of Bengal. It is of a large though uncertain extent. The country is naturally fertile, but greatly overgrown with jungle, and thinly inhabited. The natives are Hindoos of the Khutzi tribe, and are said to be very pusillanimous. It was invaded by a Burman army in 1774, but the troops were attacked by the hill fever, and died in such numbers that they were obliged to retreat, and were finally cut off in detail by the natives. A second expedition in 1776 was more successful; and the rajah of Cachar was obliged to do homage to the Burman sovereign. The British formerly maintained an intercourse with this country, but since it has fallen under the Burman yoke this intercourse has been stopt.

CÎ›CHUNDE, the name of a medicine, highly celebrated among the Chinese and Indians, and composed of several aromatic ingredients, perfumes, medicinal earth, and precious stones. They make the whole into a stiff paste, and, according to their fancy, form out of it several figures, which are dried for use; these are principally used in the East Indies, but are sometimes brought over to Portugal. In China the principal person's usually carry a small piece in their mouths, which is a continued cordial, and gives their breath a very sweet smell.
