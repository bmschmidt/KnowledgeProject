CAKE, a finer sort of bread, so denominated from its flat round figure, <. , [7:5:783] • The Hebrews had several sorts of cakes, which they offered in the temple. These were made of the meal either of wheat or barley, and were kneaded sometimes with oil and sometimes with honey; though sometimes they only rubbed them over with oil when they were baked, or fried them with oil in a frying-pan upon the fire. In the ceremony of Aaron’s consecration, they sacrificed a calf and two rams, and offered unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil; the whole being made of fine wheaten flour.
