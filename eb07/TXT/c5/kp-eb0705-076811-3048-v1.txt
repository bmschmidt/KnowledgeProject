CADET, the younger son of ä family, is a term naturalized in our language from the French. In Spain it ιs usual for one of the cadets in great families to take the mother’s name.
[7:5:769]

Cadet is also a military term denoting a young gentleman who chooses to carry arms in a marching regiment as a private man. His views are, to aequire some knowledge in the art of war, and to obtain a commission in the army. Cadet differs from volunteer, as the former takes pay, whereas the latter serves without pay.
