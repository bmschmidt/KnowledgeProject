CALATOR, in antiquity, a crier, or officer appointed to publish something aloud, or call the people together. The word is formed from καλεω, voco, ii I call.” The pon-tificcs had such ministers, whom they used to send before them when they went to sacrifice οnferice or holidays, in order to advertise the people to leave off work. The magistrates also used calatores, to call the people to the comitia, both curìata and centuriata. The officers in the army also had calatores ; as had likewise many private families, to invite their guests to entertainments.
