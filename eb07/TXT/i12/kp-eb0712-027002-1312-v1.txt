INERTIA of Matter is defined by Sir Isaac Newton to be a passive principle by which bodies persist in a state of motion or of rest, receive motion in proportion to the force impressing it, and resist as much as they are resisted. It is also defined by the same author to be a power implanted in all matter, whereby it resists any change endeavoured to be made in its state. See Physics.
