ISAURA, or Isaurus, in Ancient Geography, a strong city of Mount Taurus, in Isauria, which was twice demolished; first by Perdiccas, or at least by the inhabitants, who, through despair, destroyed themselves by fire, rather than fall into the hands of the enemy; again by Servilius, who thence took the surname Isauricus. Strabo says there were two Isauras, the old and the new, but so near that they were often confounded.
