ICEBERGS are large bodies of ice filling the valleys between the high mountains in northern latitudes. Among the most remarkable are those of the east coast of Spitzbergen. The glaciers of Switzerland seem contemptible when compared to these, but present often a similar front into some lower valley. At times immense fragments break off and tumble into the water with an alarming splash. Frost sports wonderfully with these ieebergs, and gives them majestic and singular forms. Masses have been seen assuming what an Arabian tale would scarcely dare to relate. Ieebergs are the creation of ages, and receive annually additional height by the falling of snows, and of rain, which often instantly freezes, and more than repairs the loss occasioned by the influence of the sun.
