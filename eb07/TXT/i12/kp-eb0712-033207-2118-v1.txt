INTRODUCTION, in general, signifies any thing which tends to make another in some measure known, before we have leisure or proceed to examine it thoroughly; and hence it is used on a great variety of occasions. The term is also used to signify the actual motion of any body out of one place into another, when that motion has been occasioned by some other body.
