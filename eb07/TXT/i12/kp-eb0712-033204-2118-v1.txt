INTRIGUE, an assemblage of events or circumstances occurring in an affair, and perplexing the persons concerned in it. In this sense it is used to signify the nodus or plot of a play or romance; or that point in which the principal characters are most embarrassed, through the artifice and opposition of certain persons, or the unfortunate falling out of certain accidents and circumstances.
