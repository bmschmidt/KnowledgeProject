INVOCATION, in Theology, the act of adoring God, and especially of addressing him in prayer for his assistance and protection.

The difference between the invocation of God and of the saints, as practised by the Roman Catholics, is thus explained in the catechism of the council of Trent. “We beg of God,” says the catechism, “to give us good things, and to deliver us from evil; but we pray to the saints to intercede with God and obtain those things which we stand in need of. Hence we use different forms in praying to God and to the saints; to the former we say, hear us, have mercy on US ; to the latter we only say, pray for usľ The council of Trent expressly teaches that the saints who reign with Jesus Christ offer up their prayers to God for men, and condemns those who maintain the contrary doctrine. The Protestants reject and censure this practice as contrary to

Scripture, deny the truth of the fact, and think it highly unreasonable to suppose that a limited finite being should be in a manner omnipresent, and at one and the same time hear and attend to the prayers which are offered to him in England, China, and Peru; and hence they infer, that if the saints cannot hear their requests, it is inconsistent with common sense to address any kind of prayer to them.

Invocation, in Poetry, an address at the beginning of a poem, in which the poet calls for the assistance of some divinity, particularly of his muse, or the deity of poetry.
