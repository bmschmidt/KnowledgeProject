ILLUMINED, Illuminati, a term anciently applied to such persons as had received baptism. This name was occasioned by a ceremony in the baptism of adults, which consisted in putting a lighted taper in the hand of the person baptized, as a symbol of the faith and grace which he had received in the sacrament. fc Illumined, Illuminati, is also the name of a sect of heretics who sprang up in Spain about the year 1575, and were called by the Spaniards Alambrados. Their principal doctrines were, that by means of a sublime manner of prayer, which they had attained to, they entered into so perfect a state, that they had no occasion for ordinances, sacraments, or good works; and that they could give way even to the vilest actions without sin. The sect of Illumined was revived in France in the year 1634, and was soon afterwards joined by the Guerinets, or disciples of Peter Guerin, who together formed but one body, called also Illumined ; but being hotly pursued by Louis XIII. they were soon destroyed. The brothers of the Rosy Cross are sometimes also called Illumined. See Rosy- CRUCIAN.
