ICHTHYOPHAGI, Fish-eaters, a name given to those who lived wholly on fishes. The word is Greek, being compounded of ίγβνς, piscis, fish, and <ραγeιv, edere, to eat. This name or term has been applied to different people.

The Ichthyophagi spoken of by Ptolemy are placed by Sanson in the provinces of Nanking and Xantong. Agatharcides calls all the inhabitants between Carmania and Gedrosia by the name of Ichthyophagi. From the accounts given us of the Ichthyophagi by Herodotus, Strabo, Solinus, Plutarch, and others, it appears indeed that they had cattle, but that they made no use of them, excepting to feed fish withal.
