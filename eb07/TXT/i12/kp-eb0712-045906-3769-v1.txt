ISIDORUS, called Damiatensïs, or Pelusiota, from his having lived in a solitude near that city, was one of the most famous of all St Chrysostom’s disciples, and flourished in the time of the general council held in 421. We have upwards of two thousand of his epistles in five books. They are short, but well written, in Greek. The best edition is that of Paris, in Greek and Latin, printed in 1638, in folio.
