ILLUSTRIOUS, Illustris, in the Roman empire, a title of honour peculiar to people of a certain rank, It was first given to the most distinguished amongst the knights, who had a right to bear the latus clavus ; but afterwards those only were entitled illustrious who held the first rank amongst the persons called honorati, that is, the prÎ±fecti proetorii, praefecti urbis, treasurers, comites, and others. The Novels of Valentinian distinguish as many as five kinds of illustres, amongst whom the illustres administratores bear the first rank.
