ITINERARY, Itinerarium, a journal of travels, or an account of the distances of places. The most remarkable itinerary is that which goes under the names of Antoninus and Aethicus, or, as Barthius found in his copy, Antoninus Aethicus ; a Christian writer, posterior to the times of Constantine. There is another itinerary, called Hierosolymitanum, from Bordeaux to Jerusalem, and from LIeraclca through Aulona and Rome to Milan, under Constantine. The word Itinerarium denotes a dayâ€™s march.
