IBYCUS, a Greek lyric poet who flourished 550 b. c., and of whose works there are only a few fragments remaining. It is said that he was assassinated by robbers, and that when dying he called upon some cranes he saw flying past to bear witness. Not long afterwards one of the murderers seeing some cranes, said to his companions, “There are the witnesses of Ibycus’s death ;” which being reported to the magistrates, the assassins were put to the torture, and having confessed the fact, were hanged. And hence arose the proverb lbyci Grues.
