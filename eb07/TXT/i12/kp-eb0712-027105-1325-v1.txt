INFANTRY, in military affairs, the whole body of foot soldiers, whether consisting of independent companies or regiments. This word takes its origin from one of the infantas of Spain, who, finding that tne army commanded by the king her father had been defeated by the Moors, assembled a body of foot-soldiers, and with them engaged and totally routed the enemy. In memory of this event, and to distingush the foot-soldiers, who were not before held in much consideration, they received the name of infantry. Heavy-armed Infantry, amongst the ancients, were such as wore a complete suit of armour, and engaged with broad shields and long spears. They formed the flower and strength of the Grecian armies. See Army. Light-armed Infantry, amongst the ancients, were designed for skirmishing, and for fighting at a distance. Their weapons were arrows, darts, or slings.

Light Infantry, amongst the moderns, have only been in use since the year 165Î². They have no camp equipage to carry, and their arms and accoutrements are lighter than those of the infantry. See Army.
