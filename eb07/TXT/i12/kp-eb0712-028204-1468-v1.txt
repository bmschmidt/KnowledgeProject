INNISHANNON, a town in the county of Cork, and province of Munster, 134 miles from Dublin, and situated on the river Bandon, six miles from Kinsale. The river is navigable to Collierâ€™s Quay, about half a mile below the place. This place was formerly walled, and of some note.

The town of Innishannon, together with its ferry, were granted to Philip de Barry by letters patent from Henry V. in 1412.
