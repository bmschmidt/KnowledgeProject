INNISFALLEN, an island in the lake of Killarney, in the county of Kerry, and province of Munster, containing the ruins of a very ancient religious house, founded by St Finian, the patron saint of these parts, to whom the cathedral of Aghadoe is also dedicated. The remains of this abbey are very extensive, and its situation is retired and romantic.
