INTERLUDE, an entertainment exhibited on the theatre between the acts of a play, to amuse the spectators, or to give time for changing the scenes and decorations. In the ancient tragedy, the chorus sung the interludes, to show the intervals between the acts. Interludes, amongst us, usually consist of songs, dances, feats of activity, concerts of music, and the like. Aristotle and Horace lay it down as a rule, that the interludes should consist of songs founded on the principal parts of the drama; but since the chorus has been discontinued, dancers, buffoons, and such like performers, ordinarily furnish the interludes.
