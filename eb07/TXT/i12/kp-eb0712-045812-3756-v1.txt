ISENBERG, now a province of the principality of Hesse Cassel, having been added to it when the former sovereign, who is still the chief proprietor, was mediatised. It is about 100 square miles in extent, is a hilly district, with extensive woods, is watered by the rivers Kinzig and Bracht, and the population living in four market-towns and forty-four villages, to the amount of 47,500, subsist chiefly by agricultural occupations. None of the four towns in it, except Berstein, has a thousand inhabitants.
