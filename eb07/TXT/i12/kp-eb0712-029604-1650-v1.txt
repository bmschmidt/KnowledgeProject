INSTAURATION, the re-establishment or restoration of a religion, a church, or the like, to its former state. The word is by some derived from the old Latin instaurum, which signified the stock of things necessary for the tilling and managing of grounds, as cattle, tools, harness, and the like. But the word instaurum is only of the middle age; whilst instauratio is of much greater antiquity, and by some derived from instar, like, as importing a thingâ€™s being brought to its former likeness or appearance.
