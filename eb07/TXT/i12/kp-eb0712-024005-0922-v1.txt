ICONIUM, at present Cogni, formerly the capital of Lycaonia in Asia Minor. St Paul, proceeding to Iconium (Acts, xiii. 51, xiv. 1), in the year of Christ 45, there converted many Jews and Gentiles. It is believed, that in his first journey to this city he converted St Thecla, so celebrated in the writings of the ancient fathers. But some incredulous Jews excited the Gentiles to rise against Paul and Barnabas, and as the former were upon the point of offering violence to them, the apostles were obliged to fly for security to the neighbouring cities. St Paul undertook a second journey to Iconium in the year 51, but we know no particulars concerning his journey which relate especially to Iconium.
