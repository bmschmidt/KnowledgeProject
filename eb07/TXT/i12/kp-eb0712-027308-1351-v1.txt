INFLECTION, called also diffraction, and deflection, in Optics, is a property of light, by reason of which, when it comes within a certain distance of any body, it is either bent from it, or towards it; which is a kind of imperfect reflection or refraction. See Optics. Inflection, or Point of Inflection, in the higher geometry, is a point where a curve begins to bend in a contrary way.

Inflection, in Grammar, the variation of nouns and verbs, by declension and conjugation.
