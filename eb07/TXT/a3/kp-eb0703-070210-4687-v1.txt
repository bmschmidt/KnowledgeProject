ASNA, or Ãˆsna, a town in Upper Egypt, seated upon the Nile, and occupying the site of the ancient Latopolis. It is near the cataracts of the Nile, and is the last place of any magnitude on the side of Nubia. It contains several monuments of antiquity, and among the rest an ancient Egyptian temple, pretty entire, all painted throughout, except in some places that are effaced by time. The columns are full of hieroglyphic figures. This structure is considered by Denon as one of the most perfect monuments of ancient architecture he had seen. A little way from thence are the ruins of an ancient nunnery, said to be built by St Helena, surrounded with tombs. Asna is the principal town in these parts, and the inhabitants are rich in corn and cattle. They drive a considerable trade into Lower Egypt and Nubia, by means of the Nile, and also by the caravans that pass over the desert. The inhabitants are all Arabs, except about 200 Copts, the ancient inhabitants, and a sort of Christians. They are under the government of the Turks, who have a cadi; and the Arabs have two sherifs of their own nation. Long. 32. 35. E. Lat. 23. 15. N.
