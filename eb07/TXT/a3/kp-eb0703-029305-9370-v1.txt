APO ΓEICHISMUS, in the ancient military art, a kind of line of circumvallation drawn round a place in order to besiege it. This was also called periteichismus. The first thing the ancients went about when they designed to lay close siege to a place, was the apoteichismus, which sometimes consisted of a double wall or rampart, raised of earth; the innermost to prevent sudden sallies from the town, the outermost to keep off foreign enemies from coming to the relief of the besieged. This answered to what are called lines of coηtravallαtion and circumvallation among the moderns.

• APOTHECARY, one who practises the art of pharmacy. In London, the apothecaries are one of the city companies. They were incorporated by a charter from King James I., procured at the solicitation of Dr Mayerne and Dr Atkins: till that time they only made a part of the grocers’ company; plums, sugar, spice, &c. being sold in the same shop and by the same person. By an act which was made perpetual in the ninth year of George I. they are exempted from serving upon juries, or in ward and parish offices. They are obliged to make up their medicines according to the formulas prescribed in the college dispensatory; and are liable .to have their shops visited by the censors of the college, who are empowered to destroy such medicines as they think not good.
