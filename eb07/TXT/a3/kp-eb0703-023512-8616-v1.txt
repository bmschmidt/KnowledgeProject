ANOMOeANS, in Ecclesiastical History, the name by which the pure Arians were called in the 4th century, in contradistinction to the Semi-Arians. The word is derived from the Greek ανόμοιος, different, dissimilar : for the pure Arians asserted that the Son was of a nature different from, and in nothing like, that of the Father; whereas the Semi-Arians acknowledged a likeness of nature in the Son, at the same time that they denied, with the pure Arians, the consubstantiality of the Word. The Semi-Arians condemned the Anomoeans in the council of Seleucia; and the Anomoeans in their turn condemned the Semi-Arians in the councils of Constantinople and Antioch, erasing the word ομοιος, like, out of the formula of Rimini and that of Constantinople.
