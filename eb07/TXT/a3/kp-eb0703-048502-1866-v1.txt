ARIADNE, daughter of Minos, king of Crete. Theseus being sent to destroy the Minotaur, Ariadne was so taken with him, that, as a testimony of her love, she gave Theseus a clue of thread to guide him out of the labyrinth. Theseus, having killed the Minotaur, carried off the Athenians he had relieved, together with Ariadne, whom, however, he afterwards forsook.
