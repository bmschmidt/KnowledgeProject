ANGOUMOIS, formerly a province of France, now a district, bounded on the north by Poitou, on the east by Limosin and Marche, on the south by Perigord, and on the west by Saintonge. Through this province run the rivers Touvre and Charente. This last is full of excellent fish; and though it often overflows its banks, it is so far from doing any damage, that it greatly enriches the [7:3:154] soil. The Touvre is full of trouts. The air is generally warmer than at Paris, though the country is hilly. The soil produces plenty of wheat, rye, oats, Spanish corn, , saffron, grapes, and all sorts of fruits. Here are several iron mines, which yield a very good sort of iron.
