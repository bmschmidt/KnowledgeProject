ANTISTASIS, in Oratory, a defence of an action from the consideration that, had it been omitted, worse would have ensued. This is called by Latin writers comparativum argumentum ; such, e. g. would be the generalâ€™s defence who had made an inglorious capitulation, that, without it, the w hole army must have perished.
