ARTABAZUS, the son of Pharnaces, commander of the Parthians and Chorasmians in the famous expedition of Xerxes. After the battle of Salamis he escorted his sovereign to the Hellespont with 60,000 chosen men; and after the battle of Plataea, in which Mardonius engaged in opposition to his wishes and advice, he made a noble retreat into Asia with 40,000 men under his command.
