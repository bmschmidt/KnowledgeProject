AD ', and AD" parallel to these will mark the triple section of the angle BAC.

It may be perceived that the exterior branch of the conchoid cuts the under semicircle in another point besides F. This occurs in the extension of the radius CA, or where the diameter passing through C, the extremity of the original are, meets the opposite eireumference; the portion of the infleeted line, intercepted below BG by the conchoid, being evidently equal to the radius. The fourth intersection, however, affords no real solution, but only exhibits the amount of repeated division, as completing the arc itself.

2. But another analysis leads to a similar result. Let the angle BAD, as before, be the third part of BAC; draw BC perpendicular to AB, and CE parallel to it, meeting AD produced in E. The right angle DCE would be contained in a semicircle having DE for its diameter; join C witlι the centre H, and the triangle CHE being isosceles, the exterior angle CHA is double of CEH, or of the alternate angle BAD, and therefore equal to the remaining portion CAD of the divided angle BAC. Whence the triangle ACH is isosceles, and the side CA equal to HC, or the diameter DE must be double of AC.

The construction of the problem is thus reduced to the drawing from the vertex of the given angle a straight line ADE, such, that the part DE, intercepted between the perpendiculars BC and CE, shall be equal to the double of AC. This can only be done by describing a conchoid from the pole A to the directrix BC, and with the double of AC as the measure; the intersection of the curve with the perpendicular CE will determine the position of the trisecting line ADE. The exterior branch of the conchoid will cut the perpendicular in the point E, and the interior or nodated branch will meet and cross it at the two points E' and E". The radiating lines AE, AE', and AE", or its extension Ae", will indicate the complete trisection of the angle BAC. These lines will be found, as in the first construction, to make angles with each other that are equal to the thirds of an entire circuit. It may be worth while to examine the several cases.
[7:3:131]

In the second position D'AE' of the trisecting* line, draw CH' to the middle point. Because the triangle E'H'C is isosceles, its exterior angle CH'A is double of CE'H', or of the angle BAD'; but H'CA being also an isosceles triangle, CH'A is equal to CAH', and consequently double of BAD. Add CAD, which is double of BAD, and the compound angle DAE' is double of DAD', which would complete two right angles; whence DAE' is two thirds of two right angles, or one third of a whole circuit.

In the third position, AE"D" of the trisecting line, or rather its extension Ae", draw CH" to bisect E"D"∙ The triangles CH"D" and ACH" are then isosceles, and consequently the angle CAD" or CH"A is double of CD"A; but CAE is likewise double of CEA, and therefore the combined angle D"AE is double of the angles CD"A and CEA. Now this angle D"AE, together with the two angles CD"A and CEA, is evidently equal to the exterior angle DC"E or a right angle. Whence D"AE is two thirds of a right angle, or one third of two right angles, and therefore the adjacent angle DAe" is two thirds of r two right angles, or one third of a whole circuit.

3. The simplest and most elegant solution of the trisection of an arc was indicated by Pappus, and is given in Castillon’s Commentary on Newton’s Universal Arithmetic. The problem is there reduced to the combination of the circle with acertainkind of hyperbola. Butthegeneral property of the directrix, which belongs to all the conic sections, or the lines of the second order, affords the readiest mode of investigation. Let the arc BD be the third part of BDC. Complete the circle, and draw the chords BD, BC, and CD. The arc CD is evidently double of BD, and therefore the angle CBD is double of BCD. Bisect the angle CBD by the straight line BH, let fall the ex-ľ tended perpendicular, and draw the parallel DK. The triangle CHB is evidently isosceles, and HI bisects the base CB. But the triangle CBD having its vertical angle at B bisected, the side CB is to BD as the segment CH of the base to HD; that is, since the triangles CHI and DHK are similar, as CI to KD; wherefore, CB being the double of CI, BD is likewise double of DK. Γhe ratio of the distances BD and DK is thus given, while the point B is given, and the straight line IH given m position. Whence, from the theory of lines of the

Second Order, the locus of the point of section D is an hyperbola, of which B is a focus, and IH a directrix, with the determining ratio of two to one. Let this construction be made, and the arc CDB is trisected in D. For since BD is, from the property of the curve, double of DK, it is evident that BC is to CI as BD to DK; and the triangles CIH and KDH being similar, and CI to CH as DK to DH, it follows that BC is to CH as BD to DH, or alternately BC is to BD as CH to DH. Wherefore the vertical angle CBD is bisected by BH, or the angle CBD is double of CBH or of BCD, and consequently the arc CD is double of of the whole arc CDB.

But the opposite branch of the hyperbola, which passes through C, also comes into play; and the intersection of these two branches with the circle assigns three different positions of the point D, separated from eaeh other by intervals equal to the third of the whole circumference. Thus, in the second position D', produce the perpendicular D'K' to the opposite circumference L; and since BD' is double of D'K, it must be equal to the chord D'L, and consequently the arc BDCD' is equal to LD"MD'. Wherefore the double of BDCD', together with the interval BL or CD', is equal to the whole circumference; that is, the double of DCD', with the double of BD and CD', is equal to the whole circumference; and since the double of BD is DC, the triple of the arc DCD' must complete the circumference. In the third position D", produce the perpendicular D"K" as before: the double of this, or the chord MD", is hence equal to D"B, and the arc BLD" equal to DM: consequently the double of BLD", with the compound arc BDCM, completes the circumference; but D"M being parallel to BC, the arc BLD" is equal to CD'M, and therefore three times the arc BLD", with the arc BDC, or the triple of BD, will fill up the circumference, or the arc DBD" is a third part of it.^[1. For more illustration of this subject, see Leslie’s Geometry of Curve Lines.]

The trisection of innumerable arcs described on the same chord is rendered very conspicuous by combining the separate branches of two hyperbolas that have the determining ratio of two to one, and their foci situate in the extremities of the given line. Thus, let the chord BC be trisected at the points N and 0, anďfrom B and C, as distinct foci, and in the determining ratio of two to one, describe branches of independent hyperbolas. All the arcs erected on BC are each of them divided by those curves into three equal portions. These arcs, as they flatten, approach to the trisected chord CNOB on the [7:3:132] one hand; and as they become enlarged, they constantly tend, on the other, to the complete circumferenee which , the asymptotes of the hyperbola, making angles on each side of the axis equal to two thirds of a right angle, would themselves trisect.

It may be observed in general, that the section of an are or angle admits of as many different answers as the number of divisions proposed. Thus, the quadrisection would give four distinct results, and a quinseetion would involve no fewer than five separate products. Nay, the bisection itself of an are, though within the limits of the most elementary geometry, yet brings out a double result. Thus, the are CDB is bisected by the perpendicular or diameter DID', which not only gives BD for the half of that are, but also BDCD', or the same half-arc augmented by a semĩeireumference.

These conclusions agree with the results derived from the general theory of equations. The expression for the sine of a multiple arc is always an equation of corresponding dimensions, whieh therefore admits of as many distinct roots as the index contains units.

The ancient geometers were only acquainted with the original division of the circumferenee into two, three, or five equal portions. The only subdivisions were obtained from the differences of those arcs or their continued bisection. But the very ingenious Professor Gauss has discovered a series of more complex regular polygons, which may be inscribed in a circle by elementary geometry. The expression 2” + 1, when a prime number, will represent the sides of the figure: for the general equation of a eosine of the section can be decomposed into quadratics of the simplest kind, which can be constructed by the repeated application of circles and straight lines. A polygon of 17 sides is the first that oeeurs after the pentagon; and then follow the polygons of 257, 65537, &c. (b.) Angles, an aneient German nation, originally a branch of the Suevi; who, after various migrations, settled in that part of Denmark, and duchy of Sleswiek, of whieh the city of Flensborg is the capital. Here they were known, even in the time of Tacitus, by the name of An-glì. The origin of this name is variously accounted for. Aecording to Saxo Grammatieus, they were called Angli, from one Angulus, son of Humblus king of Denmark. Goropius derives their name from the Saxon word Angel or Engel, signifying a fish-hook; the Angles, like the other Saxon nations, being greatly addicted to piraey, and on that account being so named by the neighbouring nations; as if, like hooks, they caught all that was in the sea. To this nation the British ambassadors are said to have applied when soliciting succours against the Scots and Picts. The Angles, therefore, came over in greater numbers than any other Saxon nation, and accordingly had the honour of giving the name of Anglia to England.
