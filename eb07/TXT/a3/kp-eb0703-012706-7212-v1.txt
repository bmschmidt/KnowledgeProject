ANGELITES, in Ecclesiastical History, a sect of Christian heretics in the reign of the emperor Anastasius, and the pontificate of Symmachus, about the year 494; so called from Angelium, a place in the city of Alexandria where they held their first meetings. They were called likewise Sévérités, from one Severus, who was the head of their sect; as also Theodosians, from one among them named Theodosius, whom they made pope at Alexandria. They held that the persons of the Trinity are not the same; that none of them exists of himself, and of his own nature, but that there is a common god or deity existing in them all, and that each is God, by a participation of this deity.
