ANDRON, in Grecian Antiquity, denotes the apartment in houses designed for the use of men; in which sense it stands opposed to Gynoeceum. — The Greeks also gave their dining-rooms the title of andron, because the women had no admittance to feasts with the men.
[7:3:125]

l ANDRONA, in ancient writers, denotes a street or public place where people met and conversed together. In some writers androna is more expressly used for the 1 space between two houses; in which sense the Greeks also use the term αv¾wαg for the way or passage between two apartments.

Androna is also used, in ecclesiastical writers, for that part in churches destined for the men. Anciently it was the custom for the men and women to have separate apartments in places of worship, where they performed their devotions asunder; which method is still religiously observed in the Greek church. The avδgωv, or androna, was in the southern side of the church, and the women’s apartment on the northern.
