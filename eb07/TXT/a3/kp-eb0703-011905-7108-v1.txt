ANDRADA, Diego de Payva dâ€™, or Andradius, a learned Portuguese, born at Coimbra in 1528, who distinguished himself at the council of Trent, where King Sebastian sent him as one of his divines. He wrote several volumes of sermons, and other pieces; one of which, De Conciliorum Autoritate, was highly esteemed at Rome [7:3:120] on account of the great extension of authority which it gave to the pope. He died in 1575.
