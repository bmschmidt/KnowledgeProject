APODECTAe, in Antiquity, a denomination given to ten general receivers appointed by the Athenians to receive the public revenues, taxes, debts, and the like. The apodectae had also a power to decide all controversies arising in relation to money and taxes, except those of the most difficult nature and highest concern, which were reserved to the courts of judicature.
