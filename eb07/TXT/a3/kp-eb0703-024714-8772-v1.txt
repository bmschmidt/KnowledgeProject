Antequera, a city of Spain, in the province of Seville, in Andalusia. It is situate in a beautiful and fertile valley, covered with olive-trees, around which, in all directions, lofty mountains rise to a great height, which contain valu-Î¹ble quarries of marble of every description. Near it is i saline lake, which supplies the inhabitants of the district with salt for all their.culinary purposes. As longas the Moors possessed the kingdom of Granada, this city, from being the point which commands the eastern entrance to the plain, was a military post of vast importance, and its possession was perpetually contested by the rival monarchs on both sides of it. An ancient castle still remains, in which are preserved specimens of the various military weapons and accoutrements both of the Moors and the Christians of the 14th century. It contains about 14,000 inhabitants, employed in cultivation and in the manufactures of cloth and leather.
