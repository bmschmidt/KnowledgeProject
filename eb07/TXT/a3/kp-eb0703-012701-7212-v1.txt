ANGARIA, in Roman Antiquity, a kind of public 7 service imposed on the provincials, which consisted in providing horses and carriages for the conveyance of military stores and other public burdens. It is sometimes also used for a guard of soldiers, posted for the defence of a place. In a more general sense it is used for any kind of oppression, or services performed through compulsion.
