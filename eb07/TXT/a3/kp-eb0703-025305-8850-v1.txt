ANTIPAROS, an island in the Archipelago, opposite’ to Paros, from which it is separated by a strait about Seven miles over. It is the Oleares or Oliaros mentioned by Strabo, Pliny, Virgil, Ovid, &c.; and was, according to Heraclides Ponticus, as quoted by Stephanus, first peopled by a Phoenician colony from Sidon. According to Mr Tourneforťs account, it is about 16 miles in circumference, and tolerably fertile.

This island is remarkable for a subterraneous caverm or grotto, accounted one of the greatest natural curiosi-· ties in the world. It is 300 fathoms below the surface of the earth, and appears to be about 40 fathoms high’ and 50 wide, penetrating far into the bosom of the island. It is full of large and beautiful stalactites. There have been many descriptions of this celebrated grotto, of which that by Tournefort is supposed to be very complete and exact. (^Relation d’un Voyage du Levant.)
