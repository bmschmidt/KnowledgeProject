ARACHNE, in fabulous history, a young maid of Lydia, said to have been' the inventress of spinning. She is fabled to have been so skilful in this art as to challenge Minerva at it, who tore her work, and struck her; which disgrace driving her to despair, she hanged herself. Minerva, from compassion, brought her to life, and transformed her into a spider, which still employs itself in spinning.
[7:3:347]
