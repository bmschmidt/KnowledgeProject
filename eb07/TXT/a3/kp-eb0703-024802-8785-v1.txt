ANTHONY, Saint, was born in Egypt in 251, and inherited a large fortune, which he distributed among his neighbours and the poor, retired into solitude, founded a religious order, built many monasteries, and died anno 356. Many ridiculous stories are told of his conflicts with the devil, and of his miraeles. There are seven epistles extant attributed to him.

St Anthony is sometimes represented with a fire by his side, signifying that he relieves persons from the inflammation called after his name; but always aeeompanied by a hog, on aeeount of his having been a swine-herd, and curing all disorders in that animal. To do him the greater honour, the Romanists in several plaees keep at eommon charges a hog denominated St Anthony's hog, for which they have great veneration. Some will have St Anthony’s picture on the walls of their houses, hoping by that to be preserved from the plague; and the Italians, who do not know the true signification of the fire painted at the side of their saint, concluding that he preserves houses from being burnt, invoke him on sueh oeeasions. Both painters and poets have made very free with this saint and his followers; the former by the many ludicrous pictures of his temptation, and the latter by divers epigrams on hiş diseiples or friars.

Anthony, or Knights of St Anthony, a military order instituted by Albert duke of Bavaria, Holland, and Zealand, when he designed to make war against the Turks in 1382. The knights wore a eollar of gold made in form of a hermit’s girdle, from whieh hung a stiek eut like a eruteh, with a little bell, as they are represented in St Anthony’s pictures.

St ANTHONY also gives the denomination to a religious order founded in France about the year 1095, to take eare of those afflicted with St Anthony’s fire (see the next artiele). It is said that in some plaees these monks assume to themselves a power of giving, as well as removing, the ignis sacer, or erysipelas; a power whieh stands them in great stead, for keeping the poor people in subjection, and extorting alms.

St Anthony's Fire, a name properly given to the erysipelas. Apparently it took this denomination, as those afflicted with it made their peeuliar application to St Anthony of Padua for a cure. It is known that, aneiently, particular diseases had their peculiar saints. Thus, in the ophthalmia, persons had recourse to St Lueia; in the toothache, to St Apollonia; in the hydrophobia, to St Hubert, &e.
