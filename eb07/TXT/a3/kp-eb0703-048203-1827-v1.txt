ARGO, in Antiquity, a ship or vessel celebrated among the poets, being that wherein the Argonauts, of whom Jason was the chief, made their expedition in quest of the golden fleece. Jason having happily accomplished his enterprise, consecrated the ship Argo to Neptune, or, as others say, to Minerva, in the isthmus of Corinth, where, they add, it did not remain long before it was translated into heaven, and made a constellation.
