ANDROMEDA, in Astronomy, a northern constellation, behind Pegasus, Cassiopeia, and Perseus. It represents the figure of a woman chained, and is fabled to have been formed in memory of Andromeda, daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia, and wife of Perseus, by whom she had been delivered from a sea monster, to which she had been exposed to be devoured for her motherâ€™s pride. Minerva translated her into the heavens.
