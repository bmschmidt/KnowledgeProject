ASSELYN, John, a famous painter, was born in Holland, and became the disciple of Isaiah Vandervelde, the battle-painter. He distinguished himself in history-painting, battles, landscapes; animals, and particularly horses. He travelled into France and Italy, and was so pleased with the manner of Bambochio that he always followed it. He painted many pictures at Lyons, where he married the daughter of a merchant of Antwerp, and returned with her to Holland. Here he first discovered to hiś countrymen a fresh and clear manner of painting landscapes like Claude Lorraine; upon which all the painters imitated his style, and reformed the dark brown they had hitherto followed. Asselyn’s pictures were so much admired at Amsterdam that they sold there at a high price. He died in that city in 1660. Twenty-four pieces of landscapes and ruins, which he painted in Italy, have been engraved by Perelle.
