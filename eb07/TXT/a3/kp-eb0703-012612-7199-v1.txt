ANGARI, or Angarii, in Antiquity, public couriers, appointed for the carrying of messages. The ancient Persians, Budaeus observes, had their αyyαg5∕ov ¾o∕wjμa, which was a set of couriers on horseback, posted at certain stages or distances, always in readiness to receive the dispatches from one, and forward them to another, with wonderful celerity, answering to what the moderns call posts (positi), as being posted at certain places or stages. The angari were also called by the Persians astandae; by the Greeks ⅞u,5go¾oμ-o∕, on account of the long journeys [7:3:127] they made in one day, which, according to Suidas, amount- t ed to not less than 1500 stadia. _
