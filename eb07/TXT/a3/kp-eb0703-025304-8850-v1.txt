ANTIPAeDOBAPTISTS, (derived from αvr∕, against, ι Jraις, ναιδος, child, and βa∙τr~ιζω, I baptize, whence βa ι ZτιGτr ∣ ς), is a distinguishing denomination given to those who object to the baptism of infants; because they say infants are incapable of being instructed, and of making that profession of faith which entitles them to this ordinance, and an admission into church communion.
