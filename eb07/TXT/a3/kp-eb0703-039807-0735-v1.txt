ARCHENA, a town of Murcia, in Spain. It is situated on the river Segura, at the eastern extremity of the delicious valley of Ricote, and celebrated for its thermal springs. The waters retain a uniform heat of 41° of Reaumur, or 112° of Fahrenheit. These springs are much resorted to, though the situation is most melancholy, and the accommodations for invalids very bad.
