AROO, an island in the Eastern Seas, 140 miles in length by about 40 in breadth, lying to the south of Papua. The Chinese merchants settled at Banda carry on a traffic with this island, from which they procure pearls, edible bird-nests, esteemed so great a delicacy by the Chinese epicures, tortoise shell, and stones. An aromatic vegetable substance called the Missoy bark is found here: it is also conjectured to be the haunt of the bird of paradise. The centre of the island is in long. 135. E. and lat. 6. S.
