ANJENGO, a small seaport town and fortress of Hindostan, in Travancore, nearly encircled by a deep and broad river, at the mouth of which it is situated. The fort was built by the English in 1684, and it was retained till 1813, when the factory was abolished on account of the useless expense attending it. Anjengo is infested with snakes, scorpions, and centipedes; those animals finding shelter in the matted leaves of the cocoa-tree, with which the houses are mostly thatched. Here and at Cochin are manufactured, of the fibres of the Lucadine cocoa-nut, the best coir cables on the Malabar coast. The exports are pepper, coarse piece goods, coir, and some drugs.
