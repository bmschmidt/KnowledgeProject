ASAPH, St, a small episcopal city in the county of Flint, in North Wales, at the confluence of the rivers Clwd and Elwy, said to have been founded in the year 560. The situation is fine, but the town itself has a poor appearance, the houses being small and ill built. The chief objects are the cathedral, a plain building about 170 feet in length and 90 in height; the bishop’s palace, a co ’ mmodious but simple dwelling; and another church, i∏ which divine service is performed in the Welsh language. The diocese consists of parts of Flintshire, Derbyshire, Montgomeryshire, Merionethshire, and comprehends a few parishes in Shropshire. The deanery, in the gift of the bishop, is a more valuable benefice than the bishopric itself. It is 209 miles from London, and 21 from Chester. No market is held there. Population, in 1801,1513; in 1811, 1724; in 1821, 2294.
