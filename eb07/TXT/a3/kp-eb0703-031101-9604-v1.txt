APPROACHING, in fowling, a term used to express such devices as are contrived for the getting within shot of shy birds. It is principally used in marshy low places. The best method of approaching is by means of three hoops tied together at proper distances, according to the height of the man that is to use it, and having boughs of trees tied all round it, with cords to hang it over his shoulders. A man getting into this conceals himself, and approaches by degrees towards his game in the form of a moving bush. Geese, ducks, and teal, quit the waters in the evening, and pass the night in the fields; but at the approach of morning they return to the water, and even when on the water they will retire to great distances on the approach even of a horse or cow, so that the business of the stalking-horse is of little use; but this device of approaching by the moving bush is more successful.
