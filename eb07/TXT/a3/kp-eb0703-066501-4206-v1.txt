ASCOL1, one of the delegations into which the Papal States in Italy are divided. It comprises a part of the ancient mark of Ancona or of Fermo. It is bounded on the north-west and north by Fermo, on the east by the Adriatic Sea, on the south by the territory of Naples, and on the west by Spoleto. The extent is 480 square miles, or 307,200 acres. The Appennines are in part included in this province. It contains 3 cities, 4 markettowns, and 44 villages, with 69,058 inhabitants. The soil is generally fruitful, and the climate salubrious.—The capital of the delegation is of the same name, the see of a bishop, and the tribunal of law. It is situated atthe junction of the river Castellano with the Tronto. In the mouth of the latter is a small harbour for coasting vessels. The city contains a cathedral, 12 parish churches, 12 monasteries, 6 nunneries, a Jesuit’s college, and 7550 inhabitants. Long. 13. 28. 25. E. Lat. 42. 51. N.
