APOSPHRAGISMA (from αwo, and o ’ %α∕∕ζω, I seal), in Antiquity, the figure or impression of a seal. It was forbidden among the ancients to have the figure or image of God on their rings and seals. To this purpose the precept of Pythagoras, Er oαzτ∪λ∕ω s/zorø Θsou μr, π ’ ipφiζnv! But in process of time this was little regarded; it was usual enough to have the figures of Egyptian and other deities, as well as of heroes, monsters, friends, ancestors, and even brutes, on their dactyli or ring-seals.
