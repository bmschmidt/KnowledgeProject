ASSHETON, William, doctor of divinity, and rector of Beckenham in Kent, was born in the year 1641, and was educated at Brazen-nose College, Oxford. After entering into orders he became chaplain to the duke of Ormond, and was admitted doctor of divinity in 1673. Soon after he was nominated to a prebend in the church of York, presented to the living of St Antholin, London, and to the rectory of Beckenham in Kent. He was the first projector of the scheme for providing for clergymen’s widows and others, by a jointure payable out of the mercers’ company. He wrote several pieces against the papists and dissenters, and some devotional tracts. He died at Beckenham in September 1711, in the 70th year of his age.
