ANTITYPE, a Greek word, properly signifying a type or figure corresponding to some other type. The word antitype occurs twice in the New Testament, viz. in the Epistle to the Hebrews, ix. 24, and in St Peter, 1 Ep. iii. 21, where its genuine import has been much controverted. The former says that “Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are, αιwιwα, the figures or antitypes of the true—now to appear in the presence, of God for us.” Now rυvος signifies the pattern by which another thing is made; and as Moses was obliged to make the tabernacle, and all things in it, according to the pattern shown him in the mount, the tabernacle so formed was the antitype of what was shown to Moses: any thing, therefore, formed according to a model or pattern is an antitype.

Antitype, among the ancient Greek fathers, and in the Greek liturgy, is also applied to the symbols of bread and wine in the sacrament. Hence it has been argued by many Protestants, that the Greeks do not really believe the doctrine of transubstantiation, because they call the bread and wine antitypes, αντίτυπα, q. d. figures, similitudes, and this even after the consecration.
