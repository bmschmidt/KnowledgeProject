ANUBIS, a symbolical deity of the Egyptians, was regarded as the faithful companion of Osiris and of Isis. Temples and priests were consecrated to him, and lus image was borne in all religious ceremonies. Cynopohs> [7:3:277] situated in the Lower Thebais, was built in honour of 'Anubis. The temple in which he was worshipped no longer exists. The priests celebrated his festivals there with great pomp, and consecrated the dog to him as his living representation. “Anubis,” says Strabo, “is the city of dogs, the capital of the Cynopolitan prefecture. These animals are fed there on sacred aliments, and religion has decreed them a worship.” An event, however, related by Plutarch, brought them into considerable discredit with the people. Cambyses having slain the god Apis, and thrown his body into a field, all animals respected it except the dogs, which alone ate of his flesh. This impiety diminished the popular veneration for them.

Cynopolis was not the only city which burned incense on the altars of Anubis. He had chapels in almost all the temples. On solemnities, his image always accompanied those of Isis and Osiris. Rome having adopted the ceremonies of Egypt, the emperor Commodus, to celebrate the Isiac feasts, shaved his head, and himself carried the god Anubis. The statue of this god was either of massive gold or gilt, as well as the attributes that accompanied him. Anubis signifies gilded. The denomination was mysterious; and the Egyptian priests, it would seem, had not given it without reason.

The signification of this emblematical deity is thus explained by Plutarch: “The circle which touchesand separates the two hemispheres, and which is the cause of this division, receiving the name of horizon, is called Anubis. He is represented under the form of a dog, because that animal watches day and night.” St Clemens of Alexandria, who was well informed in the mystic theology of the Egyptians, favours this explication. The two dogs, says he (the two Anubis), are the symbols of two hemispheres which environ the terrestrial globe. He adds in another place,—others pretend that these animals, the faithful guardians of men, indicate the tropics, which guard the sun on the south and on the north like porters.

According to the former of these interpretations the priests, regarding Anubis as the horizon, gilded his statue, to mark that this circle, receiving the first rays of the sun, appears sparkling with brightness on his rising, and that at his setting he reflects his last rays upon the earth. They said, in their sacred fables, that Anubis was the son of Osiris, but illegitimate. In fact, he only gives to the earth a borrowed light, and cannot be esteemed, like Horus, as the father of the day, or as the legitimate offspring of Osiris. It may be added, that the visible horizon, turning with the sun, is his inseparable companion.

In the latter of these explications, where Anubis represents the tropics, he is also the faithful guardian of Isis and Osiris. In fact, the course of the sun and of the moon is contained between the circles wherein the solstices are performed. They neither deviate to the right nor left. These limits, assigned by the Author of nature, might, therefore, in hieroglyphic language, be represented by a divinity with the head of a dog, who seemed to oppose the passage on the side of the two poles. The other opinion, notwithstanding, seems more natural, and to be more analogous to the ideas of the priests.

Upon the whole, it is reasonable to imagine that Anubis at first was only a symbolical image, invented by astronomers to give a sensible expression of their discoveries; that afterwards the people, accustomed to see it in their temples, which were the depositories of science, adored it as a deity; and that the priests favoured their ignorance by connecting it with their religion. The worship of Anubis being introduced, that of the dog became his emblem. . Almost all the gods of· the Gentiles have originated i∏ this manner. l ΑN ∖ IL, in smithery, and other manufactures of the malleable metals, is an instrument on vvhich substances are laid for the purpose of being hammered.

For some purposes anvils are made of cast iron; but when the face of the anvil is required to possess great hardness, or a bright surface, it is made of wrought iron and faced with steel. The core or body of wrought iron anvils is prepared at the forge, where malleable iron is first formed into bars, or into masses for any particular purpose. The body of the anvil is formed by welding a number ot smaller masses together under the forge-hammer. These are rude blocks of different sizes, according to the size of the anvil. Smaller masses are also furnished in this way, which the anvil-maker occasionally welds to the large blocks, for giving to the anvil any particular form.

The fire-place or hearth of the anvil-maker’s forge is similar to the common smith’s forge. His bellows are not double, like the latter. His fuel is cork, which produces a great heat without much flame. Adjacent to the hearth is a crane, which, turning upon a pivot, brings the heated masses of iron from the fire to the anvil. The latter is a large mass of cast metal, about 18 inches square on the face, and about a foot from the ground. When the core of the anvil to be formed is heated, the first thing is to make three square holes, one in the bottom, and one at each end of the anvil. These holes are about 11- inch long, 1 inch broad, and about 2 inches deep. They are for the purpose of receiving a bar of iron, which is connected with the crane by which the anvil is held in the fire, and by which it is turned and guided while forming with the hammers.

The common smith’s anvil is generally made of seven pieces, namely, the core or body; the four corners, for the purpose of enlarging its base; the projecting end, which contains a square hole, for the reception of a set, or chisel, to cut oft’ pieces of iron; and the seventh piece is the beak, or conical end, used for turning pieces of iron into a circular form, welding hoops, &c. These pieces are each separately welded to the core, and hammered so as to form a regular -surface with the whole. When large pieces are required to be welded to the core, one fire is not sufficient to heat both at the same time. In this case two hearthš are employed. The core and the piece are both raised to a welding heat. The piece being put into its place, is hammered by a quick succession of blows till it adheres. The whole is again heated and hammered till the due form is obtained. The hammering is performed by a number of men at the same time, each using a large swing-hammer. The blows follow each other in regular succession, great experience and care being required to prevent the hammers from coming in contact with each other.

When the anvil has received its due form, it now requires to be faced with steel. This is performed by first preparing the steel face to the size of the anvil. The anvil is then heated to a strong welding heat in one fire, while the steel facing is heated in another, but not. so hot as the iron. The anvil is now brought out and placed in a proper position, and the facing is brought to it. The surfaces which are to be brought together are brushed, and the facing is then laid on and hammered as rapidly as possible, till it is closely united. The whole is finished by repeated heating-and hammering.

The next process iş that of hardening the anvil. This consists in heating the face, in particular, to a full red heat, and quenching it in cold water. When a stream of water can be employed it is better. Where this cannot be had, the mass of water should be great, and the anvil moved about as quick as possible. The facing should be laid on as thin as it can be firmly welded; when it is too thick it is apt to crack in the hardening. τ [7:3:278] After hardening, the face is ground till it is perfectly even, and the edges made sharp or round, as may be required. When the anvil is required for planishing metals, it is polished with emery, and afterwards with crocus.

The smith’s anvil is generally placed loose upon a wooden block, the root-end of an oak-tree being preferred. The anvils used in cutlery and for files are fastened into a large block of stone, which is doubtless better than having the anvil loose upon a small block. The more firmly the anvil is connected with the earth and the substance it stands upon, the greater will be the effect of the blow of the hammer.
