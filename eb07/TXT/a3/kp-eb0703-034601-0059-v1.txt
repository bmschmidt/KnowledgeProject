ARABICI, a sect who sprung up in Arabia about the year 207, whose distinguishing tenet was, that the soul died with the body, and also arose again with it. Eusebius (lib. vi. c. 38) relates that a council was called to stop the progress of this rising sect; and that Origen assisted at it, and convinced them so thoroughly of their error that they abjured it.
