ASTARAKAT, a town of Persiaj in the province of Segistan or Seistan. 100 miles N. of Zareng; 220 W.NΛV. of Candahar.

• ASTAROTH, or Ashtaroth, in Antiquity, a goddess of the Sidonians. The word is Syriac, and signifies sheep, especially when their udders are turgid with milk. From the fecundity of these animals, which in Syria continue to breed a long time, they formed the notion of a deity, whom they called Astarοth or Astarte. Solomon, in compliment to one of his queens, erected an altar to her. In the reign of Ahab, Jezebel caused her worship to be performed with much pomp and ceremony; she had 400 priests; the women were employed in weaving hangings or tabernacles for her; and Jeremiah observes, that “thè children gathered the wood, the fathers kindled the fire, and the women kneaded the dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven.”
