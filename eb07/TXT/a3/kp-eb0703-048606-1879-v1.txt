ARIOLI, in Antiquity, a kind of prophets or religious conjurers, who, by abominable prayers and horrible sacrifices at the altars of idols, procured answers to their questions concerning future events. Isid. Orig. lib. viii. cap. 9. These are also called harioli, and their operation hario-lation. Sometimes they were denominated antspices or haruspices. The arioli were distinguished by a slovenly dress, disorderly and matted beards, hair, &c.

ARION, an excellent musician and poet, inventor of dιthyι ambies. Periander entertained him at his court, where, getting an estate, and returning to Corinth, the sailors, in order to possess themselves of his money, threw him into the sea, when, according to the poets, a dolphin, charmed with his music, took him on her back and carried him safe to shore.

Arion, an admirable horse, much more famous ⅛ poetic history than Bucephalus in that of Alexander. Authors speak variously of his origin, though they agree in giving him a divine one. His production is most commonly ascribed to Ncptune. This god, according to some, raised him out of the ground by a stroke of his trident; according to others, he begot him upon the body of the fury Erinnys; according to others, upon that of Ceres, whom he ravished in the form of a horse, she having previously assumed the form of a mare to elude his pursuit This horse was nursed by the Nereids; and being sometimes yoked with the sea-horscs of Neptune to the chariot of this god, he drew him with incredible swiftness through the sea. He had this singularity in him, that his right fect resembled those of a man. Neptune gave him to Capreus, king of Haliartus. Capreus made a present of him to Hercules, who mountcd him when he took the city of Elis, gained the prize with him in the race against Cygnus, the son of Mars, near Troecena, and at last made a present of him to Adrastus. It is under this last master that Arion has signalized himself the most: he won the prize at the Nemean games, which the princes who went to besiege Thebes instituted in honour of Archemo-rus; and was the cause that Adrastus did not perish in this famous expedition, as all the other chiefs did.
