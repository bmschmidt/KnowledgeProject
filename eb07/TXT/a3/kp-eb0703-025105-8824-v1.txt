ANITMENSIUM, a kind of consecrated table-cloth, occasionally used in places where there is no proper altar.

Antimensium, in the Greek church, answers to the αltαre portabile, or portable altar, in the Latin church. They are both only of late invention, though Habertus would have them as old as St Basil. But Durant and Bona do not pretend to find them in any author before the time of Bede and Charlemagne.— Antimensia is also applied to other tables used in offices of religion, besides those whereon the eucharist is administered: such, e. g. are those whereon the host is exposed, &c.
