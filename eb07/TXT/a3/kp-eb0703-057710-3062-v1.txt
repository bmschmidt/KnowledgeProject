ARMORIC, or Aremoric, something that belongs to the province of Bretagne or Britany, in France. The [7:3:578] name Armorica was anciently given to all the northern and western coast of Gaul, from the Pyrenees to the Rhine, under which name it was known even in Caesar’s time. The word is of Bas-Breton origin, and signifies maritime; compounded, according to Μ. Menage, of ar, upon, and more, sea.
