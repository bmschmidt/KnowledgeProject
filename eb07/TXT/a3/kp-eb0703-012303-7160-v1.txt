ANDROGEUS, in Fabulous History, the son of Minos, king of Crete, was murdered by the Athenian youth and those of Megara, who envied his being always victor at the Attic games. But Minos having taken Athens and Megara, obliged the inhabitants to send him an annual tribute of seven young men and as many virgins, to be devoured by the Minotaur. From this tribute they were delivered by Theseus.
