ANDRA, or Andros, a Turkish paschaliac, including the island of that name and the neighbouring islands of Tine, Mitone, Delos, Syra or Syros, Thermia Zea, and Hydra. The inhabitants are estimated at 96,800, almost wholly Greeks; the most industrious, and, exclusive of the effects of the present war, the most flourishing people of the Archipelago. There are some smaller islands included in the pasehaliac, whose whole extent is 474 square miles. The island of Andros contains 12,000 inhabitants, mostly Greeks, who raise much silk, wine, and oil, and sufficient corn for their own consumption.
