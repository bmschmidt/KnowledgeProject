ASHBURTON, a market and borough-town in the hundred of Teignbridge, and county of Devon, 191 miles from London and 19 from Exeter. It stands in a valley surrounded on every side by hills, on the great road to Plymouth. The parish-church is in the cathedral form, with a lofty tower and spire. It is one of the four towns in which a court is held for the mining districts. There was formerly an extensive trade in the manufacture of serges, which has declined much of late years. It is an ancient borough, returning two members to Parliament, who are chosen by the freeholders, in number about 200. The market is held on Saturday. The population was, in 1801, 3080; in 1811, 3058; and in 1821, 3403.
