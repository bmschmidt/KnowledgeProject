ANNE, queen of Great Britain, second daughter of King James II. by his first wife, Anne Hyde, was born in 1664. In 1683 she married George prince of Denmark, by whom she had several children, but none of them arrived at the age of maturity. On the death of King William she ascended the throne, A. d. 1702, and her reign comprehends one of the most illustrious periods of English history. Possessed, however, of a very feeble character, which did not permit her to act for herself, this period is the reign of her counsellors and favourites; and she exhibited no decided inclination which could influence state affairs, except a strong passion for tory principles, both in church and state. She died in August 1714, of a dropsy, in the 50th year of her age and 13th of her reign.
