ASCETERIUM, in ecclesiastical writers, is frequently used for a monastery, or place set apart for the exercise of virtue and religion. The word is formed from ascesis, exercise; or ascetra, one who performs exercise. Originally it signified a place where the athletae or gladiators performed their exercises.
