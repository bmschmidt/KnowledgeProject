ANCIENT Demesne, in English Law, is a tenure whereby all manors belonging to the crown in the times of William the Conqueror and St Edward were held. The numbers, names, &c. were entered by the Conqueror in the record called Domesday Book; so that such lands as by that book appeared to have belonged to the crown at that time are called ancient demesne.
