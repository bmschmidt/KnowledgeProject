ANNULOSA (from annulus, a ring or segment), a term in zoology applied by naturalists to a great division of the animal kingdom. It contains five classes, viz. Crustacea, Myriopoda, Arachnides, Insecta, and Vermes. These classes will be treated of separately in this work, as explained under the words Animal Kingdom. See the concluding part of that article.
