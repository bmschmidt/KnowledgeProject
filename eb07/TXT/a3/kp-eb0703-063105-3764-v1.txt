ARTEMISIA, wife of Mausolus, king of Caria, has immortalized herselfby the honours which she paid to the memory of her husband. She built for him, in Halicarnassus, a very magnificent tomb, called the Mausoleum, which was one of the seven wonders of the world, and from which the title of Mausoleum was afterwards given to all tombs remarkable for their grandeur; but she died of regret and sorrow before it was finished. She appointed panegyrics to be made in honour of him, and proposed a prize of great value for the person who should compose the best. She died about the end of the 106th Olympiad, 351 years before the Christian era.

Artemisia, queen of Caria, and daughter of Ligdamĩs, marched in person in the expedition of Xerxes against the Greeks, and performed wonders in the sea-fight near Salamis, 480 years before the Christian era. She was passionately fond of a man named Dardanus, of Abydos; but, enraged at his neglect of her, she put out his eyes while he was asleep. The gods punished her for this, by increasing the passion she entertained for him; so that the oracle having advised her to go to Leucas, which was the usage of desperate lovers, she took the leap from thence, and was interred at that place. Many writers cönfound this Artemisia with the former, the wife of Mausolus.
