ANTWERP, one of the provinces which compose the kingdom of the Netherlands. It is formed out of the two Freneh departments of the two Drenthes, or out of the more ancient county of Antwerp, and barony of Mechlin. It is bounded on the north-east and north by North Brabant, on the south-east by Limburg, on the south by South Brabant, and on the west by West Flanders, from whieh it is divided by the Scheldt. It is an extensive plain, with scarcely an elevation; and the soil is a light sand mixed with a clayey loam, which is highly fertile. The land is protected from inundation by extensive embankments, and these dams inclose some of the most productive and highly cultivated spots, provincially known as polders. The northern and eastern part of the province is sandy and poor, and filled with morasses. The chief river is the Scheldt, which, before its junction with the sea, reeeives the Rupel, Nuthc, and Dyle. It is 2160 feet broad and 30 feet decp at Antwerp. There are two navigable canals, one from Brussels and the other from Louvain. The province is highly productive, both in agricultural and manufacturing commodities. The extent is 1004 square miles, or 642,560 acres. The inhabitants, at the last eensus, were 287,347. It is divided into three circles or arrondissements, 17 eantons, and 141 communes. This province elects five deputies to the states-general of the kingdom.

Antwerp, the ehief city of the province of that name, as well as of a eircle comprehending six cantons, 55 communes, and 131,169 inhabitants. The city is in the form of a crescent, on the right bank of the Scheldt; is strongly fortified, and protected by a citadel w hich connects the walls with the river. The houses are large and handsome, the streets tolerably wide, well paved, and at night well lighted. The most remarkable building is the Gothic cathedral, 500 feet in length and 240 in breadth, adorned by two of the best productions of the pencil of Rubens, with a tower 380 feet in height. Besides the cathedral, the chureh of St James, the exchange, the town-house, the easterling’s-house, the theatre, and the hotel de eharité, invite the attention of strangers. There are many manufactures of all kinds. The most considerable is that of silk goods. The breweries, distilleries, sugar-refineries, and tanneries, are numerous. One art, that of cutting diamonds, had been long practised here,.and very extensively till the French ruled the country; and since their expulsion it has been onee more revived. The city is well situated for foreign trade, from its easy connection by canals with the interior, and from its conveniencies for landing and shipping goods, to whieh last the docks constructed by the French vastly contribute. I he trade has not, however, hitherto made rapid progress, but has gradually increased sinee the port has been opened. The inhabitants, at the last census, were 60,057. It is in lat. 51. 13. 22. N. and long. 4. 18. 14, E.
