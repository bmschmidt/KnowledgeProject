ARDENNES, a department of France, formed out of a part of the ancient forest of the same name. It is bounded by the Netherlands and the department of the Meuse on the north and east, by the department of the Aine on the west, and that of the Marne on the south. The extent is 1,142,720 acres, and the population 258,896. It is divided into five arrondissements. It produces wood from its forests, breeds much cattle, grows some medium wine, and obtains coals, iron, and slate.

- ARDENTES, among middle-age writers, an appellation I Ä©ven to those afflicted with the ignis sacer, or erysipelas. They were so called from their appearing as if scorched or burned with the disease. . The abbey of St Genevieve at Paris is said to have received the name of Domus Ardentium because great numbers were cured of that distemper at the shrine of this saint in the reign of Louis VI.
