ANTONOMASIA, a form of speech, in which, for a proper name, is put the name of some dignity, office, profession, science or trade; or when a proper name is put in the room of an appellative. Thus a king is called his majesty ; a nobleman, his lordship. We say the philosopher instead of Aristotle, and the orator for Cicero. Thus a man is called by the name of his country, a German, an Italian ; and a grave man is called a Cato, and a wise man a Solomon.

ANTOSIANDRĪANS, a sect of rigid Lutherans, who oppose the doctrine of Osiander relating to justification. These are otherwise denominated Osiandromαstiges. The Antosiandrians deny that man is made just with that justice wherewith God himself is just; that is, they assert that he is not made essentially, but only imputatively, just; or, that he is not really made just, but only pronounced so.
