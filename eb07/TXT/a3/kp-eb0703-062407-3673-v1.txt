ARNULPH, or Ernulph, bishop of Rochester in the reign of Henry I. He was born in France, where he lived some time a monk of St Lucien de Beauvais. The monks led most irregular lives in this monastery, for which reason he resolved to quit it, but first took the advice of Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, under whom he had studied in the abbey of Bee, when Lanfranc was prior of that monastery. This prelate invited him over to England, and placed him in the monastery of Canterbury, where he lived a private monk till Lanfrauc’s death. When Anselm came to the archiépiscopal see, Arnulph was made prior of the monastery of Canterbury, and afterwards abbot of Peterborough. In 1115 he was consecrated bishop of Rochester, which see he held nine years, and died in March 1124, aged 84. Arnulph wrote a piece in Latin concerning the foundation, endowment, charters, laws, and other things relating to the church of Rochester: it is generally known by the title of Textus Roffensis, and is preserved in the archives of the cathedral church of Rochester. It has been printed in Thorpe’s Registrurn Roffense.
