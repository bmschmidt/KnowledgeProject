ARDFERT a town of Ireland, in the county of Kerry, of which it was formerly the capital, though it is now a ruinous and decayed village. It had at one time a university, and was a bishop’s see; but it is now united to that of Limerick. Here are several religious edifices· and a pillar tower, which stood near the cathedral, and was one of the loftiest and finest in the kingdom. It fell in 1771. Four miles N. W. of Tralee.
