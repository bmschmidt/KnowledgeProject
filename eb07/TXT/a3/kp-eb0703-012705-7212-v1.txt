ANGELICS, Angelici, in Ecclesiastical History, an ancient sect of heretics, supposed by some to have got this appellation from their excessive veneration of angels; and by others, from their maintaining that the world was created by angels.

Angelics is the name of an order of knights, instituted in 1191, by Angelus Flavius Comnenus, emperor of Constantinople: also of a congregation of nuns, founded at Milan in 1534, by Louisa Torelli, countess of Guastalla. They observe the rule of St Augustin.
