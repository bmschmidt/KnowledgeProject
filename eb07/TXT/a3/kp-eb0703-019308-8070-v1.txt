ANKLAM, a circle in the government of Stettin and the Prussian province of Pomerania. It extends over 566 square miles, or 363,240 English acres. There are within it 4 cities, 6 towns, and 201 villages. The inhabitants are 30,856. The land is a plain, with extensive woods, and about twenty fresh-water lakes, the largest of which is the Ahlbeckr. The feeding of cattle and growing of corn are the chief objects of agriculture; besides which, some hops and tobacco, and much flax, are grown. The woods afford much profitable employment, and furnish charcoal to the iron-works in Pomerania. The capital of the circle is of the same name. It is situated on the river Peene, and is now without fortifications. It contains 3 churches, 3 hospitals, 599 houses, and 5833 inhabitants. By means of the river, which is navigable, it carries on some trade; and it has manufactures of cloth, hosiery, tobacco, snuff, and leather. It is in long. 24. 1. 59. E. lat. 53. 49.15. N.
