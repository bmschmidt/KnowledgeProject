ANGARA, a river of Siberia, which has its rise in the Lake Baikal. It passes the town of Irkutsk with a rapid course, and receiving the Oka, it changes its name to Toungooska, and falls into the Yenesei or Jenesei after a course of 700 miles. It is navigable, and is noted for the clearness of its waters.
