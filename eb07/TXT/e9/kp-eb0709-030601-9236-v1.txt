EPHRAIM, in Ancient Geography, one of the tribe divisions of Palestine. Ephraim and the half tribe of Manasseh are blended together by the sacred writer; and it appears that Ephraim occupied the more southern, and the half tribe of Manasseh the more northern parts, but both seem to have extended from the Jordan to the sea. Ephraim also denotes a kingdom, on the separation of the ten tribes from the house of David, called the kingdom of Israel and Samaria.
