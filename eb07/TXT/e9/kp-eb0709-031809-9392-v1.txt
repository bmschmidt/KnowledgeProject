EPPING, a market-town of the county of Essex, in the hundred of Waltham, seventeen miles from London. It was remarkable for its situation in a district formerly very woody, and preserved by our ancient monarchs for the enjoyment of the sports of the held. It was then called Waltham Forest, and extended almost to the capital. I∏ the same neighbourhood also was Hainault Forest, where a fair was held for many centuries under a remarkable tree, well known by,the name of Fairlop Oak, which has existed till recently, and was of prodigious size. The greater part of these districts have been disforested, and converted into fertile fields. The town of Epping has a market, which is held on Friday, but at a small distance from the buildings. It preserves the fame it has long enjoyed for its butter, its sausages, and its pork, in the London markets. The population amounted in 1801 to 1729 in 1811 to 1874, in 1821 to 2146, and in 1831 to 2313. ’
