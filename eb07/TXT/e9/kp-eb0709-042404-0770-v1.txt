EVANDER, a king of Arcadia, said to be son, sometimes of Mercury and sometimes of Echemuş, king of Arcadia, had as his mother the nymph Nicostrate or Carmenta, according to the Latins. Various reasons are given to account for his emigration to Italy. According to Servius (Virg. Aem. viii. 51, 130), he had killed his father by accident; but Ovid says that he was compelled by civil broils to abandon his kingdom to his brother Ladocos. This event is supposed to have taken place about fifty years before the taking of Troy. Faunus, who then reigned in Italy, received Evander and his companions with great kindness, granting to him as much land as was necessary to build a city. Its foundations were laid on the Palatine hill; and it was called Pallatium or Pallanteum, either in honour of his son Pallas, or in remembrance of a village of the same name in Arcadia. Evander was greatly annoyed by the thefts of a giant named Cacus, who dwelt on the Aventine hill; but Hercules, whom he received with much hospitality, freed him from this formidable enemy. At a later period Virgil introduces him to us, as forming an alliance with Aeneas, and furnishing him with a body of troops commanded by his son Pallas. (Aeŉ. viii. 154). He gave laws to his people, taught the: aborigines of Italy agriculture, invented music, and introduced into his new country the knowledge of letters. After his death he was by the gratitude of his subjects , ranked among the gods.

ι EVANGELISTS, the inspired authors of the Gospels, i The word is derived from the Greek ίυαγγιλιον, formed of i εu, bene, well, and αyytλoς, angel or messenger.

The denomination of evangelists was likewise given in , the ancient church to those who preached the gospel in different parts, without being attached to any particular i church, being either commissioned by the apostles to in-ι struct the nations, or having of their own accord aban-; cloned every worldly attachment, and consecrated themselves to the sacred office of preaching the gospel. In this sense it is, according to some interpreters, that St Philip, who was one of the seven deacons, is called the evangelist in the twenty-first chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. Again, St Paul, writing to Timothy (Ep. ii. ? chap. iv. ver. 5), bids him do the work of an evangelist; whilst the same apostle (Eph. iv. 11) ranks the evangelists after the apostles and prophets.
