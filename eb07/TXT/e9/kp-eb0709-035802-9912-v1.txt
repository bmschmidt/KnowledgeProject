ERATO (from tsaÏ‰, I love), in Mythology, the name of one of the nine muses, who presided over amatory poetry. To this muse some have ascribed the invention of the lyre and the lute. She is represented with a garland of myrtles and roses, holding a lyre in one hand and a bow in the other, and at her side is a Cupid with his torch. There is also a Nereid of the same name.
