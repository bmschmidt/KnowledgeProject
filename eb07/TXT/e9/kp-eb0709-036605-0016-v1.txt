ESARHADDON, the son of Sennacherib, and his successor in the kingdom of Assyria. He is said to have reigned twenty-nine years at Nineveh, from the year 3294 to 3322; besides which he reigned thirteen years at Babylon, making in all forty-two years. He died in the year of the world 3336, and was succeeded by Saosduchinus. Esarhaddon Sir Isaac Newton considers as the same with the Sardanapalus, who, according to Clectarchus, died of old age, after the revolt of Syria; the name Sardαηαραlui being derived from Asserhadon Pul.
