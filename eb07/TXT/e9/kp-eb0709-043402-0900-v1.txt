EVESHAM, a market and borough town of Worcestershire, in the hundred of Blakenhurst, 96 miles from London. It is finely situated in the midst of the rich vale of the same name, on both sides of the river Avon. A great number of market gardeners in the vicinity raise large quantities of the rarer vegetables, but especially of asparagus, for the supply of Oxford, Birmingham, and other large towns. It returns two members to parliament, chosen by the freemen. The market is held on Monday. The population amounted in 1801 to 2837, in 1811 to 3068, in 1821 to 3487, and in 1831 to 3991.
