EXTRAORDINARY, something out of the common course.

Extraordinary Couriers are those sent expressly on some urgent occasion.

Extraordinary Ambassador, or envoy, is one who is sent to treat or negotiate some special and important affair, as a marriage, a treaty, confederacy, or even on occasion of some ceremony, as condolence, congratulation, and the like.

A gazette, journal, or other newspaper extraordinary, is that which is published after some notable event, containing the detail or particulars thereof.
