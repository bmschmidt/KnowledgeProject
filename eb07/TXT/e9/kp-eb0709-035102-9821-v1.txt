EQUERY, or Ecury, a grand stable or lodge for horses, furnished with all suitable conveniences, as stalls, manger, rack, &c. The word is formed from the French Ã©curie, which signifies the same thing. Some, again, derive ecurie from the Latin scuria, which not only denotes a place for beasts to be stalled in, but also a grange or barn. But a more probable derivation is from equile, a stable for horses, from equus, horse. Some think that the word stable properly relates only to bullocks, cows, sheep, hogs, &c. and equery to horses, mules, &c.

A simple equery is that provided for one row of horses; a double equery that provided for two, with a passage in the middle; or two passages, the horses being placed head to head.

Under the term equery are sometimes also comprehended the lodgings and apartments of the equeries, grooms, pages, and others.

Equery {pcuyer) is also an officer who has the care and management of the horses of a king or prince.
