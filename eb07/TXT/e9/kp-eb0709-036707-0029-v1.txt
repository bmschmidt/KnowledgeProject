ESNE, or Esneh, a considerable town of Upper Egypt. “Esneh,” says Denon (Travels, ii. 103), “is the ancient Latopolis. Some remains are still visible of its port or quay on the bank of the Nile, which has often been repaired, but, notwithstanding all that has been done for it, still remains in a very miserable condition. This town also contains the portico of a temple, which appears to me to be the most perfect monument of ancient architecture. It is situated near the bazar in the great square, and would make an incomparable ornament to this spot, if the inhabitants[7:9:368] had any idea of its merit; but instead of this, they have deformed it by the most miserable ruined hovels, and have devoted it to the vilest purposes. The portico is very well preserved, and possesses great richness of sculpture. It is composed of eighteen columns with broad capitals: these columns are noble and elegant, though they now appear in the most disadvantageous light: the rubbish should be cleared to find if any part of the cella remains.” See article Egypt.
