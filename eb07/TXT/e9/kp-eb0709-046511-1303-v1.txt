EXODIUM, in the ancient Greek drama, one of the four parts or divisions of a tragedy, being as much of the piece as included the unravelling and catastrophe of the plot, and answering nearly to our fourth and fifth acts.

Exodium, amongst the Romans, consisted of certain humorous verses rehearsed by the exodiary at the end of the Fabulae Atellanoe. Exodium, in the SeptuagÄ©nt, signifies the end or conclusion of a feast; and, in particular, it is used for the eighth day of the feast of tabernacles, which, it is said, had a special view to the commemoration of the exodus or departure out of Egypt.
