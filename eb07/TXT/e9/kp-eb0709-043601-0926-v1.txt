EXAUCTORATIO, in the Roman military discipline, differed from the missio, which was a full discharge, and took place after a soldier had served in the army twenty years; whereas the exauctoratio was only a partial discharge. The exauctorati lost their pay indeed, but still remained under their colours or vexilla, though not under the aquila or eagle, which was the standard of the legion; and hence, instead of legionarii, they were called subsignani, and were retained till they had either served their full time or had lands assigned them. The exαu<Λο-ratio took place after a soldier had served seventeen years. ∣ EXCALCEATION, amongst the Hebrews, was a particular law, by which a widow, whom her husband’s brother refused to marry, had a right to summon him to a court of justice, and, upon his refusal, to excalceate him· that is, to pull off one of his shoes and spit in his face, both of which actions inferred great ignominy.
