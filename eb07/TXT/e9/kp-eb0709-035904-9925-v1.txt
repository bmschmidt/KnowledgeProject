ERFURT, a city of the Prussian province of Saxony, and the capital of a circle of its own name, as well as of the provincial government. It is strongly fortified, and is defended by two forts, the Petersburg and the Cyrials-burg, both of most skilful construction. It is situated in a district of peculiar fertility, especially in garden fruits and seeds, the latter of which supply the seedsmen in distant parts of Germany. It sells large quantities of annis, canary, coriander, cummin, mustard, and poppy seeds; and much urplus corn. There was formerly a university, but it has declined, as well as most of the convents and monaste- ‚àèes which existed before its secularization. It now possesses a gymnasium and elementary schools, as well as many charitable establishments. It is a clean and well-built city, containing an ancient cathedral, with a lofty spire, and a bell weighing fourteen tons; eight Catholic and eight Lutheran churches, 2897 houses, and (in 1817) 18,218 inhabitants, now much increased in number. There have been lately erected some cotton spinning-mills; and other Manufactures have since the peace very greatly extended. Being on the great road from Frankfort to Dresden and Leipsic, it has a considerable transit trade. Long. 11. 57. 17 E. Lat. 50. 59. 8. N.
