ESCUTCHEON, or Scutcheon, in Heraldry, is derived from the French escusson, which is a corruption of the Latin scutum, and signifies the shield on which coats of arms are represented or emblazoned. Most nations, even from the remotest antiquity, were wont to have their shields distinguished by certain marks painted on them; and to be able to display these on their shields was a token of honour, none being permitted to have such until they had performed some honourable action.
