EUCHARIST, the sacrament of the Lord’s supper. The word in the original Greek, Eo^ag/ďna, literally imports thanksgiving ; being formed from íu, bene, well, and %αg∕,, gratia, thanks. This sacrament was instituted by Christ himself; and the participation of it is called communion.

As to the manner of celebrating the eucharist among the ancient Christians; after the customary oblations were made, the deacon brought water to the bishops and presbyters, standing round the table, to wash their hands; according to the words of the psalmist, “I will wash my hands in innocence, and so will I compass thy altar, 0 Lord.” Then the deacon cried aloud, “mutually embrace and kiss each other ;” which being done, the whole congregation prayed for the universal peace and welfare ot the church, for the tranquillity and repose of the world, for the prosperity of the age, for propitious weather, and for all ranks and degrees of men. After this followed the mutual salutations of the minister and people; and then the bishop or presbyter, having sanctified the elements by a solemn benediction, broke the bread, and handed it to the deacon, who delivered it to the communicants; and in like manner afterwards the cup. The sacramental wine was usually diluted or mixed with water. During the time of administration hymns and psalms were sung; and the whole concluded with prayer and thanksgiving, upon which the people saluted each other with the kiss of peace, and so the assembly broke up.

, EUCHITES or Euchitae, a sect of ancient heretics, who were first formed into a religious body towards the end of the fourth century, though their doctrine and discipline existed in Syria, Egypt, and other eastern countries, before the birth of Christ. They were so called because they prayed without ceasing, imagining that prayer alone was sufficient to save them. They rested chiefly on the injunction of St Paul, Pray without ceasing- The name is formed from the Greek, ιυχ ι η, prayer, whence w χιται, the same with the Latin precatores. They were also called Enthusiasts and Messalians, terms denoting the same thing as Euchites.

ĽUCHOLOGIUM, Euχτλoχ∕ov, a Greek term, signify* ing literally α discourse on prayer. The word is formed form sυχ ι η, prayer, and λoyoς, discourse. The eucholoġiuae is properly the Greek ritual, in which are prescribed the [7:9:391] order and manner of every thing relating to the order and administration of their ceremonies, sacraments, ordinances, and the like. Gore has given an edition of the Greek euchologium in Greek and Latin, with notes.
