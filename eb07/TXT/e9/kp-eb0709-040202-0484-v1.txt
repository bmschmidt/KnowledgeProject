EUPHONY, in Grammar, an easiness, smoothness, and elegance of pronunciation. The word is formed from tu, bene, well; and <pωv ι η, vox, voice. Quintilian calls euphonia, vocalitas; ScaVιger, facilis proηunciatiο.

Euphonia is properly a kind of figure by which we suppress a letter that is too harsh, or convert it into a smoother, contrary to the ordinary rules. Of these there are numerous examples in all languages.
