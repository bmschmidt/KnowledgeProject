EVAGRIUS Scholasticus, an historian, bornât Epiphania about the year 536. He practised the profession of advocate, from which he was called Scholasticus, a name which was then given to the pleaders at the bar; and he was also tribune and keeper of the prefect’s dispatches. He wrote an ecclesiastical history, which begins where those of Socrates and Theodoret ended; besides other works, for which he was rewarded by the emperors Tiberius and Mauricius. M. de Valois published at Paris a good edition of Evagrius’s ecclesiastical history in fólio; and it was republished at Cambridge in 1620, in folio, by William Reading, with additional notes of various authors.
