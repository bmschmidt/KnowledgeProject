The north-east coast rises suddenly, but the north-west consists of valleys, meadows, and plains, abounding with groves of fruit trees, sugar-canes, bananas, shaddocks, and vegetables of various sorts. It was discovered in 1643, by Tasman, who called it Middleburg. Long. 174. 30. E. Lat. 21. 24. S.
