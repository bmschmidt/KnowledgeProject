FRONT, the forehead, or that part of the face above the eyebrows. The word is formed of the Latin frons ; and that from the Greek pfo>s∕>, to think, perceive; of <pξr,>, mens, the mind, thought. Martinius, to make out this etymology, observes, that from the forehead of a person we perceive what he is, what he is capable of, and what he thinks of. Front is also used where several persons or objects are ranged side by side, and show their front or fore parts.
