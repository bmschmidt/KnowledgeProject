FRESNOY, Charles Alphonse du, a poet and painter, was born at Paris in 1611. He was instructed by Perrier and Simon Vouet in painting; but he did not long adhere to Vouet ’ s manner of colouring; for as soon as he had fixed himself at Rome, he made the works of Titian the models for his imitation. He was, however, more celebrated as a poet than as a painter, and gave more [7:10:232] attention to the theory than to the practice of the pencil. Accordingly he is better known by his celebrated poem De Arte Graphica than byhis performances on the canvass; ' and on this work he bestowed so much labour that he died in 1665, before it was published. It was printed afterwards with a French prose translation and notes by Μ. de Piles, and was translated into English by Dryden, who prefixed to it an original preface containing a parallel between painting and poetry.
