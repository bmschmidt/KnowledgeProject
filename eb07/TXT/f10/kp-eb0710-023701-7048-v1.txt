FRITZLAR, one of the provinces into which the prinâˆ™ cipality of Hesse-Cassel is divided. It extends over 136 square miles, comprehends four cities, twenty-five villages, and thirteen hamlets, with 15,328 inhabitants. It is generally a fertile district, depending on agriculture chiefly, which yields corn nearly equal to the consumption, and much flax, with some tobacco. The capital is the city of the same name on the river Edder. It is walled, contains 478 houses, and 2467 inhabitants.
