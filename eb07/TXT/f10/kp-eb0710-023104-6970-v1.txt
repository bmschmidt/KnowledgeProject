FREJUS, a town on the shore of the Mediterranean, in the department of the Var, in France. It is in a district rich in citrons, oranges, figs, and pomegranates, but marshy and unhealthy. It was enlarged, if not built, by Julius Caesar, who gave it the name Forum Julii. It has been since celebrated as the landing-place of Bonaparte on his return from Egypt. It contained in 1837 a cathedral, and 2665 inhabitants, chiefly occupied in the Sardinia fishery. Long. 6. 38. E. Lat. 43. 25. N.
