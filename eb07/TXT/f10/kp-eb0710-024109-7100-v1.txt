FUGUE, in Music (from the Latin fuga, a flight), is a piece of music, either vocal or instrumental, or both, in which one part leads off a succession of notes forming the subject. This is taken up successively by the other parts, and is dispersed through the movement according to the taste of the composer. There are three kinds of fugues; the simple fugue, which contains only one subject, and is hence the least intricate; the double fugue, which consists of two subjects, occasionally intermingled and moving together; and the counter fugue, in which the subjects move in a direction contrary to each other. In all fugues, the parts fly after or follow each other, and hence the general name by which this kind of music is designated. See the article Music.
