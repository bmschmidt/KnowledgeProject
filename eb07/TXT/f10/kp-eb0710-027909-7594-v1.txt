FYZABAD, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Oude, situated on the southern bank of the river Dewah or Gogra. This city is said to have owed its origin to the nabob Sufder Jung, who, in √ç740, erected some temporary houses in an extensive garden at this place. His son Shuja Addowleh, after the battle of Buxar, removed his residence to this place, and gave orders for erecting a palace and other public buildings. The city was in consequence quickly enlarged, and rose into importance; but the nabob Assup Addowleh having transferred his residence to Lucknow, many of the houses, having been hastily built, fell into decay. It is still, however, a considerable city, and contains a numerous population, chiefly of the lower classes, the merchants and bankers having removed to Lucknow along with the court. It was the residence [7:10:280] of the two celebrated Begums, the mother and grandmother of the last-mentioned nabob. Adjoining is the ancient city of Oude or Ayodha, the capital of the great Ram, who conquered Ceylon. The city contains some handsome tombs belonging to the reigning family; and its gardens are celebrated for grapes and other fruits. It is eighty miles east from Lucknow. Long. 82. 10. E. Lat. 26. 46.
