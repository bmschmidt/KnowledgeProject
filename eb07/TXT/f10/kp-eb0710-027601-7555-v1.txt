FURNEAUX Islands, a cluster of islands in Bass Strait, between New Holland and Van Diemenâ€™s Land. The exact number of these islands has never been ascertained. The principal are, Great Island, which exceeds forty miles in length, Cape Barren Island, and Clarke's and Preservation Islands. There are, besides, several other smaller islands, and numerous islets. These islands are barren and unproductive, being sandy in the lower parts, [7:10:277] containing swamps and pools, and being overrun with brushwood and stunted trees, which rarely exceed the height of twelve feet. A singular phenomenon appears in Preservation Island, where, in a certain spot, the trees have undergone a partial petrifaction towards the roots. Two species of seals are found here; as also the kangaroo, wombat, and duck-billed ant-eater. Innumerable flocks of sea-birds, amongst which is the sooty peterel, haunt the shores. These islands are resorted to for the seal fishery, and afford a temporary residence to those employed in it, the islands being uninhabited. The navigation is intricate; and there is a scarcity of fresh water. These islands were first visited by Mr Bass, along with Captain Binders, in 1798.
