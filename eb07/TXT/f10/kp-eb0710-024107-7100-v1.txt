FUGALIA, in Roman antiquity, a feast supposed by some to be the same with the regifugium, held on the 24th of February, in memory of the expulsion of the kings and the abolition of monarchical government. Others again distinguish the fugalia from the regifuge. And some think that the fugalia was the same with the poplifugia, or the feast of Fugia, the goddess of joy, occasioned by the rout of an enemy, for which reason the people abandoned themselves to riot and debauchery.
