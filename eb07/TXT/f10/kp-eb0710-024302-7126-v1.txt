FULTA, a large village of Hindustan, ip the province of Bengal, situated on the east bank of the river Hooghly, twenty miles south-south-west in a straight line from Calcutta, but much more by the windings of the river. It has safe anchorage for ships, where they are protected from the swell of the sea, and where the anchors hold fast, the bottom being stiff clay.
