ZUYDER-ZEE, a great gulf or bay of the German Ocean, which extends from south to north in the United Provinces, between Friesland, Overyssel, Guelderland, and Holland. It is so called from its situation towards the south. It is said that the Zuyder-zee was formerly a lake, and that the land is swallowed up which united North Holland with Friesland.
