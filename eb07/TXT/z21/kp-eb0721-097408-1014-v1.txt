ZAMA, an ancient town of Chamane, a district of Cappadocia, of unknown situation. Another Zama, of Mesopotamia, on the Saocoras, to the south of Nisibis. A third, of Numidia, distant five daysâ€™ journey to the west of Carthage. It was the other royal residence of the kings of Numidia, hence called Zama Regia. It stood in a plain, was stronger by art than nature, richly supplied with every necessary, and abounding in men, and every weapon both of defence and annoyance. This town is remarkable for the decisive battle fought between the two greatest commanders in the ancient world, Hannibal the Carthaginian, and Scipio Africanus.
