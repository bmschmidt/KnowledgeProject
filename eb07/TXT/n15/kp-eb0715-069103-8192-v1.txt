NANKING, a large city of China, and at one time the capital of the southern division of the empire; but, since Pekin became the seat of government, it has lost its former importance, and its population has also diminished. Nanking is situated on the southern bank of the river Yang-tse-Kiang; it was formerly visited by vessels of great burden, and still communicates by smaller barks with all the interior of the empire, and with Pekin by the great canal. It has fine manufactures of silk, which are considered as its staple; and also plain and flowered satins, besides thin woollen stuffs. It is considered as a seat of Chinese learning, being the residence of many great doctors; and the booksellersâ€™ shops are better furnished than any in the empire. The city is kept very clean, though the streets are narrower than those of Pekin. The public eating-houses are numerous, and well supplied. Formerly Nanking had a magnificent palace, which was destroyed in 1645, by the Mantchoo Tartars. It is still adorned with lofty and splendid gateways, and with temples attached to them. It has also a very curious porcelain tower. This celebrated pagoda is of an octagonal form, nine stories in height, and the date of the structure is 1411. Long. 118. 34. E. Lat. 32. 4. N.
