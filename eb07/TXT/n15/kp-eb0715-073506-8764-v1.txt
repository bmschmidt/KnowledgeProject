NARRATION, in oratory, poetry, and history, a recital or rehearsal of facts as they occurred, or as it is supposed they occurred. Lord Kames, in his Elements of Criticism, has detailed and illustrated, at great length, the rules and directions which appeared to him necessary to be observed in the use of narration; and, in other works of a similar description, the same subject is also treated of, with greater or less minuteness, according to the particular objects which the authors had in view.
