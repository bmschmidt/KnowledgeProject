NAGY-BANYA, a city of the Austrian kingdom of Hungary, of the circle of the Farther Theiss, and the capital of a district of the same name. It is situated in the centre of a mining country, from which much gold, silver, and lead are extracted; and it has an institution for the education of the miners. There is a mint, in which the metals produced around it are coined into money. The inhabitants are a mixed population of Germans, Hungarians, and Greeks, and have a Catholic, a Lutheran, a Calvinist, and a Greek church, for the adherents of those several modes of worship; the whole number is 5800. Around the city there are some vast woods of chestnut trees, the fruit of which is a valuable article of trade; and there is a considerable commerce in corn. Long. 23. 29. E. Lat. 47. 37. N.
