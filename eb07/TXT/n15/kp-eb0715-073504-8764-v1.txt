NARNI, a city of Italy, in the delegation of Spoleto, in the ecclesiastical territory. It is beautifully situated on the side of a hill, at the foot of which the river Nera runs through a valley of great fertility, producing abundance of figs, raisins, and currants. The town is neat, but not well peopled, the inhabitants not much exceeding 5000, though it is the see of a bishop, and has a cathedral, five parish churches, seven monasteries, and five nunneries. Here are the remains of an aqueduct, which furnishes spring water to the city. It was built by the Emperor Augustus, and is a prodigious pile of masonry. Long. 12. 16. 15. E. Lat. 42. 31. N.
