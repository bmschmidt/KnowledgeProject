BRAY, Sir Reginald, an architect and politician, was the sęcond son of Sir Richard Bray, one of the privy eouncil to King Henry VI. Sir Reginald was instrumental in the advancement of King Henry VII. to the throne of England, and was greatly in favour with that prinee, who bestowed honours and wealth upon him. His skill in arehiteeture appears from Henry VIĽs ehapel at Westminster, and the ehapel of St George at Windsor; he had a principal eoneern and direction in building the former, and in finishing and bringing to perfection the latter, to whieh he was also a liberal benefaetor. He died in 1501, and was interred in the above chapel, probably under the stone where Dr Waterland lies; for, on opening the vault to admit the body of that gentleman, who died in 1740, a leaden coffin of aneient form was found, whieh, by other appcaranees, was judged to be that of Sir Reginald, and was, by order of the dean, immediately arched over.

Bray, Br Thomas, a learned and pious divine, was born at Marton, in Shropshire, in the year 1656, and educated at Oxford. He was at length presented to the viearage of Over-Whitacre, in Warwickshire; and in 1690 he obtained the reetory of Sheldon, where he composed his Catechetical Leetures. These procured him such reputation, that Dr Compton, bishop of London, pitehed upon him as a proper person to model the infant church of Maryland, and establish it upon a solid foundation; and for that purpose he was invested with the office of eommissary. Fie now engaged in several important undertakings. He caused sums to be raised for purehasing small libraries for the use of the poor ministers in the several parts of our plantations; and the better to promote this design, he published two books. One of these is entitled Bibliotheca Parochialis, or a scheme of such theologieal and other heads as seem requisite to be perused or [7:5:188] occasionally consulted by the clergy, together with a catalogue of books which may be profitably read on each of those points; the other, Apostolical Charity, its nature and excellency considered. He endeavoured to get a fund established for the propagation of the gospel, especially among the uncultivated Indians; and by his means a patent was obtained for erecting the corporation called The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. By his industry he also procured relief for prisoners, and formed the plan of the society for the reformation of manners, charity schools, and other like purposes. He wrote Martyrology, or Papal Usurpation, in one volume, folio; Directorium Missionarium; and other works. Dr Bray died in 1730, aged seventy-three.
