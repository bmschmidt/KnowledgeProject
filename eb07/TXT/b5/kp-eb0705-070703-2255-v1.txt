BUOY, in sea affairs, a sort of close cask, or block of wood i fastened by a rope to the anchor, to determine the place where the anchor is situated, that the ship may not come too near it, to entangle her cable about the stock, or the flukes of it.

Can Buoys are in the form of a cone, and of this construction are all the buoys which are floated over dangerous banks and shallows, as a warning to passing ships, that they may avoid them. They are extremely large, that they may be seen at a distance; and are fastened by strong chains to the anchors which are sunk for this purpose at such places.

Cable Buoys are common casks employed to buoy up the cables in different places from rocky ground.
