BRABANCIONES, in the writers of the middle age, a kind of Netherlands soldiery, infamous for rapine; a sort of commissioned banditti, who hired themselves to fight for any one who could pay them. The word is variously written by the historians of those days; but every variety is derived from the country of Brabant, which was the chief nursery of these troops. They are also frequently confounded with the Routiers, Roturiers, RuptÎ±rii, Ru-terarii, Corteraux, and others.
