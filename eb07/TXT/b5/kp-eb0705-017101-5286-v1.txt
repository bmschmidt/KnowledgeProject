BRACKET, among carpenters and others, means a kind of wooden stay, serving to support shelves and the like.

Brackets, in a ship, the small knees, serving to support the galleries, and commonly carved. The timbers that support the grating in the head are also called brackets. Brackets, in Gunnery, are the cheeks of the carriage of a mortar. Being made of strong planks of wood, of almost a semicircular figure, and bound round with thick iron plates, they are fixed to the beds by four bolts, which are called bed-bolts, and, rising up on each side of the mortar, serve to keep her at any elevation by means of some strong iron bolts, called bracket-bolts, which go through these cheeks or brackets.
