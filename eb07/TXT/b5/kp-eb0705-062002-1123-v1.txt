BUC, George, a learned English antiquary, flourished in the beginning of the seventeenth eentury. In the reign of King James I. he was made one of the gentlemen of his majestyâ€™s privy ehamber, and knighted; he was also constituted master of the revels. What he mostly distinguished himself by was his writing the History of the Reign of Richard III.; in which he takes great pains to wipe off the bloody stains whieh have tarnished the eharaeter of that prinee, and represents his person and aetions in a much less odious light than any other historian has done. He also wrote, a Treatise of the Art of Revels; and a work entitled the Third Universitie of England.
