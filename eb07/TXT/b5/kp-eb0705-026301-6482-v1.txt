BRIDEWELL, a work-house, or place of correction for vagrants, and other disorderly persons.

Bridewell, near Flect-street, is a foundation of a mixed and singular nature, partaking of the characters of hospital, prison, and work-house. It was founded in 1553 by Edward VL, who gave the place where King John had formerly kept his court, and which had been repaired by Henry VIII., to the city of London, with seven hundred merks of land, bedding, and other furniture. Several youths are sent to the hospital as apprentices to manufacturers, who reside there, and they are clothed in blue doublets and breeches, with white hats. Having faithfully served their time of seven years, they become entitled to their freedom, along with a donation of ten pounds each to enable them to carry on their respective trades.
