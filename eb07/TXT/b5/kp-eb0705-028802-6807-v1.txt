BRIGITITNS, or Bridgetins, more properly Erigit-tins, a religious order, so called from their founder, St Bridget, or Birgit, a Swedish lady of the fourteenth century, whom some represent as a queen, but Fabricius, on better grounds, considers as a princess, the daughter of King Birgcnes, legislator of Upland, and famous for her revelations. The Brigittins are sometimes also called the Order of our Saviour, from their pretending that Christ himself dictated to St Bridget the rules and constitutions observed by them. In the main, the rule is the same as that of St Augustin; only with certain additions supposed to have been revealed by Christ, and hence called the Rule of our Saviour. This order spread considerably through Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, and other parts. In England we read but of one monastery of Brigittins, which was built in 1415 by Henry V., opposite to Richmond, and is now called Sion House. The revenues were reckoned at L.1495 per annum.
