BURDEN, or Burdon, in Music, the drone or bass, and the pipe or string which plays it; hence that part of a song which is repeated at the end of every stanza is called the burden of it. A chord which is divided so as to perform the intervals of music, when open and undivided, is also called the burden. Burden of a Ship is its contents, or number of tons it will carry. âˆ™
