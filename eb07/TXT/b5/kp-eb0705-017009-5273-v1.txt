BRACHYLOGY, (from βξαχυς, short, and λογος, expression), in Rhetoric, the expressing of any thing in the most concise manner. This, as far as is consistent with perspicuity, is a virtue and beauty of style; but if obscurity be the consequence, which is often the case, it becomes a blemish and defect. Quintilian gives an instance of brachylogy from Sallust: Mithridates corpore ingenti perinde armatus; “ Mithridates, as it were, armed with the hugeness of his stature.”
