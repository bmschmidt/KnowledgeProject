BULK of a Ship, the whole space in the hold for the stowage of goods.

BuLK-Heads are partitions made athwart the ship with boards, by which one part is divided from the other; as the great cabin, gun-room, bread-room, and several other divisions. The bulk-head afore is the partition between the forecastle and gratings in the head.
