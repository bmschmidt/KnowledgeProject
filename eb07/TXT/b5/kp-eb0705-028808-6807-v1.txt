BRINDISI, a city on the shores of the Adriatic, in the province of Otranto and kingdom of Naples. It was formerly fortified, but its defences are now dilapidated. It contains a cathedral, several cloisters and nunneries, and at present only 6150 inhabitants. The harbour is now nearly choked up with sand, and hence its importance has declined gradually from the state which it had attained under the name of Brundusium, when the population amounted to 60,000, and it enjoyed an extensive trade. Long. 17. 55. E. Lat. 40. 52. N.
