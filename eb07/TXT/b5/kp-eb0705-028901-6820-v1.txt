BRINE, or Pickle, water saturated with saline particles.

Brine also denotes a pickle pregnant with salt, wherein things are steeped for preservation.

ERiNE-Pans, the pits where the salt water is retained, and suffered to stagnate, that by the action of the sun it may be converted into salt. There are divers sorts of salt-pans, as the water-pans, second pan, sun-pan; the water being transferred only from one to another.

BniNE-Pit, in salt making, the salt spring from which the water to be boiled into salt is taken. There are some of these springs in many places. That at Namptwich in Cheshire is alone sufficient, according to the account of the people of the place, to yield salt for the whole kingdom; but it is under the government of certain individuals who, that the market may not be overstocked, permit only a certain quantity of the salt to be made yearly.

Brine- Springs are fountains which flow with salt water instead of fresh. Of these there arc a good number in England; but, though not peculiar to this island, they are far from being common in the countries on the Continent.

To BRING-τo, in Navigation, to check the course of a ship when she is advancing, by arranging the sails in such a manner that they shall counteract each other, and prevent her either from retreating or moving forward. In this situation the ship is said to lie by, or to lie to; having, according to the sea phrase, some of her sails aback, to oppose the force of those which are full; or having them otherwise shortened by being furled, or hauled up in the brails.

Bringing-το is generally used to detain a ship in any particular station, in order to wait the approach of some other that may be advancing towards her; or to retard [7:5:290] her course occasionally near any port in the course of a voyage.
