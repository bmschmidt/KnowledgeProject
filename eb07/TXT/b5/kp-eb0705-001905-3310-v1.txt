BOSCOI, or Boscι, in Ecclesiastical History, denotes a class or tribe of monks in Palestine, who fed on grass like the beasts of the field. The word is Greek, ∕3otfκω, graziers, formed from βοδκω, pasco. The Boscoi are ranked amongst the number of Adamites, not so much on account of their habit as their food. They took no care about provision; but when eating time came, they went into the fields, each with his knife in his hand, and gathered and ate what they could find.
