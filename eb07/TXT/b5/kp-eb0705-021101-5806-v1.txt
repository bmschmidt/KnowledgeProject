BRAZING, the soldering or joining two pieces of iron together by means of thin plates of brass, melted between the pieces that are to be joined. If the woţk be very fine, as λvhcn two leaves of a broken saw are to be brazed together, it is covered with pulverized borax, melted with water, that it may incorporate with the brass powder, which is added to it; then the piece is exposed to the fire without touching the coals, and heated till the brass is seen to run.

Brazing is also the joining of two pieces of iron together by beating them hot, the one upon the other.
