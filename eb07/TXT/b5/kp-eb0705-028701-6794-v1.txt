BRIGADIER, a military officer, whose rank is next above that of colonel, and who is intrusted with the command of a brigade. In Great Britain this rank is in abeyance during peace, but revived in actual service in the field. Every brigadier marches at the head of his brigade upon duty. The brigadier des arm√©es of the French service corresponds to our brigadier-general, and, like him, has the command of a brigade of cavalry, dragoons, or infantry.
