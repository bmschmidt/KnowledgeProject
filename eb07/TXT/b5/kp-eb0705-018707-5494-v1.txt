BRAWN, the flesh of a boar soused or piekled. For this end the boar should be old, beeause the older he is the more horny will the brawn be. The method of preparing brawn is as follows: The boar being killed, it is the flitches only, without the legs, that are made brawn; the bones of these are to be taken out, and the flesh sprinkled with salt and laid in a tray, that the blood may drain off; then it is to be salted a little, and rolled up as hard as possible. The length of the collar of brawn should be as mueh as one side of the boar will bear, so that when rolled up it may be nine or ten inehes in diameter. The eollar being thus rolled up, it is to be boiled in a eopper or large kettle till it bceome so tender that a straw may be run through it, and then set by till it is thoroughly cold, and put into a pickle prepared in the following manner: For every gallon of water add a handful or two of salt and as mueh wheat-bran; boil them together, then drain the bran clear off from the liquor, and when it is quite eold put the brawn into it.
