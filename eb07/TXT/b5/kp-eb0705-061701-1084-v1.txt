BRUTTI, in Ancient Geography, one of the two peninsulas of Italy (the ancient Calabria being the other); stretching to the south towards Sicily; bounded by the sea on every side except by the isthmus, between the river Laus and the Thurii, where it is terminated by Lucania; and inhabited by the Brutii, for whose country the ancient Romans had no peculiar name, calling both the people and the country indiscriminately Pruti√Ø.
