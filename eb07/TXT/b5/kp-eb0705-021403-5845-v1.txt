BREAKERS, a name given by sailors to those billows that break violently over rocks lying under the surface of the sea. They are distinguished both by their appearance and sound, as they cover that part of the sea with a perpetual foam, and produce a hoarse and terrible roaring, very different from the sound which the waves usually produce in a deeper bottom. When a ship is unhappily driven among breakers, it is hardly possible to save her.
