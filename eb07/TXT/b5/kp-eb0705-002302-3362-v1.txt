BOSNIA, the farthest north-east province of Turkey in

Europe. It is bounded on the north by Austria, from' which it is divided by the rivers Unna and Save; on the east by Semendra and Aladsehaissar; on the south-east by Beldseh terin and Dukagin; on the south by Iscan-dria and Austria; and on the west by Austria. It extends over 13,000 square miles. The whole province is mountainous, many of the summits reaching to the height of 6000 feet. From the nature of the soil, it is more appropriate for the breeding of cattle than the operations of the plough. ’ The drief kind of cattle reared are sheep in large flocks, some good horses and cows, with here and there a few buffaloes and goats. There are a few mines of copper; and formerly some of gold and silver were worked, especially a very celebrated one at Jlatnizza; but they are now neglected. There are some quarries of good marble; and at Tuzla a very copious and strong spring of salt water, which is converted into culinary salt. The manufactures are of the domestic kind, and upon a small scale, for making leather, cloth, and iron wares. The number of inhabitants, as in all Turkey, is doubtful. The country is thinly peopled; some accounts stating the inhabitants at 850,000, others at no more than 600,000, but all agreeing that the majority are Christians chicfly of the Catholic clιureh.
