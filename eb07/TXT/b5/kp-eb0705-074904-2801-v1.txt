BUSTUARII, in Homan Antiquity, gladiators who fought about the bustum or funeral pile of a person of distinction, in order that the blood which was spilt might serve as a sacrifice to the infernal gods, and render them more propitious to the manes of the deceased. This custom was introduced in the room of the more inhuman one of sacrificing captives at the bustum, or on the tombs of warriors.
