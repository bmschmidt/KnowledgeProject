BOTANY Bay, a spacious bay on the south-east coast of New Holland, so named by Captain Cook, by whom it was discovered in 1770, from the profusion of hitherto unknown plants growing on its shores. Great Britain has established a settlement here for transported criminals. The bay does not afford either good shelter or anchorage, the water being too shallow for large vessels, which must remain exposed to all the dangers of an open road; and on this account the British settlement, though it still retains the name of Botany Bay, is at some miles distance. See Australasia, and Wales, New South.
