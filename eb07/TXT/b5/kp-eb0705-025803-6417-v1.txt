BRIAREUS, in fabulous history, a giant, the son of Aether, Titan, or Coelus, and Terra. This was his name in heaven; but on the earth he was called Aegeon. He was of singular service to Jupiter, when Juno, Pallas, Neptune, and the rest of the gods, endeavoured to bind him in chains and dethrone him; but he afterwards conspired with the rest of his gigantic brethren to dethrone the father of the gods. In adverting to this legend, Virgil describes him as having a hundred hands and fifty heads, and breathing out fire. The fable says that Jupiter, to punish him, thrust him under Aetna, and that, as often as he moves, the mountain belches out fire.
