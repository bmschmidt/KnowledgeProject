BRAHMAPOOTRA, or Burrampooter, the largest river in India, which rises on the opposite side of the same narrow range of snow-elad mountains from which the Ganges flows. Its source has never been exaetly explored, but it is supposed to be about the 32d degree of north latitude and 82d of east longitude. After winding eastward with a rapid current through Thibet, to the south of the Himalaya Mountains, where it is called Sanpoo, it washes the border of the territory of Lassa, and passes within thirty miles to the south of this eapital of the Teshoo Lama. Thence it flows in a widely extended bed, and through many channels, in whieh is formed a multitude of islands. It receives the Painomtehieu, and many other lesser streams, before it passes Lassa, and penetrates the frontier mountains that divide Thibet from Assam. It then makes a vast sweep, and extending far to the east, until it approaches within 220 miles of Yunan, the most western province of China, it makes a sudden curve in east longitude 96, first to the south and afterw ards to the west, where it enters the province of Assam. Here it receives numerous tributary streams; and in longitude 91° 18' it divides into two great branches, whieh inelose an island of 120 miles in length. Continuing its eourse westward, it enters the province of Bengal, near to the town of Goalpara; after whieh it makes a eireuit round the Garrow Mountains; and then altering its eourse to the south, it s joined by the Megna in latitude 24° 10', in the district of Daeea; and finally unites with the Ganges, about 40 miles from the sea. This great river, ineluding its windings, has a eourse of about 1650 miles in length. Until 1765, the Brahmapootra was unknown in Europe as a great river, and Major Rennell, on exploring it, was surprised to find it larger than the Ganges. A small portion of the Brahmapootra flows through territories known to Europeans, and its navigation is supposed to be obstructed by eataracts on its entranee into Assam. This great river, during a eourse of 400 miles through Bengal, in all respeets resembles the Ganges, except in one particular, namely, that during the last 60 miles before its junction with the Ganges it forms a stream which is regularly from four to five miles wide, and, but for its freshness, might be considered an arm of the sea. The junction of the two mighty streams of the Brahmapootra and the Ganges produces an immense body of fresh water, sueh as is only exceeded by some of the great rivers in Africa, whieh lie entirely within the limits of the tropieal rains, or the Amazons and Orinoeo in South America. The bore, which is known to be occasioned by the sudden influence of the tide into a river or narrow strait, prevails in all the passages between the islands and sands situated in the gulf formed by the confluence of the Brahmapootra and the Ganges, in a greater degree than in other rivers.
