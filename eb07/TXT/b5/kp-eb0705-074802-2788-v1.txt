BUSH, Paul, the first bishop of Bristol, became a student in the university of Oxford about the year 1513, and in 1518 took the degree of baehelor of arts. He afterwards became a brother of the order called bonhommes; of whieh, after studying some time among the friars of St Austin, now Wadhaιn College, he was elected provincial. In that station he lived many years, till at length King Henry VIII. being informed of his great knowledge in divinity and physie, made him his chaplain, and in 1542 appointed him to the new episcopal see of Bristol; but Bush having, in the reign of Edward VI., taken a wife, he was on the accession of Alary deprived of his dignity, and spent the remainder of his life in a private station at Bristol, where he died in the year 1558, aged sixty-eight, and was buried on the north side of the ehoir of the cathedral. Wood says, that while he was a student at Oxford, he was numbered among the celebrated poets of that university; and Pitt gives him the character of a faithful Catholic, notwithstanding his want of chastity. He wrote, 1. An Exhortation to Margaret Burgess, wife to John Burgess, clothier, of King’s Wood, in the county of Wilts. London, printed in the reign of Edward VI. 8vo. 2. Notes on the Psalms. 3. Treatise in Praise of the Cross. 4. Answer to certain Queries concerning the abuse of the Mass, Records, No. 25. 5. Dialogues between Christ and the Virgin Mary. 6. Treatise of Slaves, and Curing Remedies. 7. A little treatise called the Extirpation of Igno-rancy. 8. Carmina diversa.
