BROSSARD, Sebastian de, an eminent French musician. In the early part of his life he had been prebendary and ehapcl-master of the eathedral ehureh of Strasburg, but afterwards beeame grand ehaplain and also maître de ehapelle in the eathedral of Meaux. There is extant of his a work entitled Prodromus Musicalis, in two volumes folio. He was also author of a very useful book entitled Dictionnaire de Musique, printed at Amsterdam, in folio, 1703; and afterwards at the same plaee in oetavo, without a date. At the end of this book is a catalogue of authors aneient and modern, to the amount of nine hundred, who have written on musie, divided into elasses; wherein are interspersed many eurious observations of the author relating to the history of musie. From Μ. Boivin’s Catalogue General des Livres de Musique for the year 1729, it appears that Brossard was the author of two sets of motets, as also of nine Leçons de Tenebres, therein mentioned. It seems that these several publications were made at a time when the author was far advanced in years; for Walther takes notice that in the Mercure Galante he is mentioned as an abbé and eomponist as early as the year 1678. He died on the 10th August 1730, aged upwards of seventy.
