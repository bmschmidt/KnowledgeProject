BRIDLE, a contrivance made of straps or thongs of leather and pieces of iron, in order to keep a horse in subjection and obedience.

The several parts of a bridle are the bit or snaffle; the head-stall, or leathers from the top of the head to the rings of the bit; the fillet, over the fore-head and under the fore-top; the throat-band, which buttons from the head-band under the throat; the reins or thongs of leather, which, proceeding from the rings of the bit, and cast over the horse’s head, are held by the rider in his hand; the nose-band, passing through loops at the back of the head-stall, and buckled under the cheeks; the trench; the cavesan; the martingal; and the chaff-halter.

Pliny assures us that one Pelethronius first invented the bridle and saddle, though Virgil ascribes the invention to the Lapithae, to whom he applies the epithet Pelethronii, from a mountain in Thessaly named Pelethronium, where horses were first begun to be broken.

The first horsemen, not being acquainted with the art of governing horses with bridles, managed them only with a rope or a switch, and the accent of the voice. This was the practiee of the Numidians, Getulians, Libyans, and Massilians. The Roman youth also learned the art of fighting without bridles, which was an exercise or lesson in the manege; and hence it is that on Trajan’s column soldiers are represented riding at full speed without any bridles on.
