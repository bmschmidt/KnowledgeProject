BUGGERS (Bιιlgarii) anciently signified a kind ofhere-tics, otherwise called Pateriηi, Cathari, and Albigenses. The word is formed from the French Bougres, and that from Bougria or Bulgaria, the country where they chiefly appeared. Among other errors, they held that men ought to believe no scripture but the New Testament; that baptism was not necessary to infants; that husbands who conversed with their wives could not be saved; and that an oath was absolutely unlawful. They were strenuously refuted by Friar Robert, a Dominican, surnamed the Bugger, as having formerly made profession of this heresy. The Buggers are mentioned by Matthew Paris, in the reign of Henry III. under the name of Bugαres∙ Circa dies autem illos invaluit haeretica pravitas eorum qm vulgariter dicuntur Paterini ct Bugares i de quorum erroribus malo tacere quam loqui.
