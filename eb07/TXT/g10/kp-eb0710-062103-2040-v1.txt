GOTTLAND, a province in the south of Sweden, including the island of that name, with the others near it on the Baltic Sea, about forty-five mites from the east of Sweden. The province has a surface of 528 square miles, comprehends one city, with 1088 insulated settlements, and contains 32,988 inhabitants. The chief occupation is the fishing and agriculture, the latter of which supplies the scanty demands of the province for food; but potatoes make a great portion of the products. The only trade is at Wisby, the capital of the province.
