GLAMOUR, or Glamer, an old term of popular superstition in Scotland, denoting a kind of magical mist, believed to be raised by sorcerers, and which deluded the spectators with visions of things that had no real existence, altered the appearance of those which really did exist, and produced other effects equally wonderful. The eastern nations have a similar superstition, as we learn from the Arabian Nights Entertainments, and other works of oriental fiction.
