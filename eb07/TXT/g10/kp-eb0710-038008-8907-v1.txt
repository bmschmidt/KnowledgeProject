GENERALISSIMO, called also captain-general, and simply general, is an officer who commands all the military powers of a nation; who gives orders to all the other general officers, and receives no orders himself excepting from the king. Îœ. Balzac observes, that the Cardinal de Richelieu first coined this word, of his own absolute authority, upon his going to command the French army in Italy.
