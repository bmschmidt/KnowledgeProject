GRIERSON, Constantia, one of the most learned women on record, though she died in 1733, at the early age of twenty-seven, was the daughter of poor parents resident in the county of Kelkenny, in Ireland. She was an excellent Greek and Latin scholar, and understood history, divinity, philosophy, and mathematics. She proved her skill in Latin by her dedication of the Dublin edition of Tacitus to Lord Carteret, and by that of Terence to his son, to whom also she addressed a Greek epigram. She wrote many elegant English poems, several of which were inserted by Mrs Barber amongst her own. When Lord Carteret was lord lieutenant of Ireland, he obtained for her husband Mr Grierson the patent office of kingâ€™s printer; and to reward the uncommon merit of his wife, caused her life to be included in it.
