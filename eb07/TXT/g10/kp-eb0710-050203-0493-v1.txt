GIBBET, a machine in manner of a gallows, on which notorious criminals, after execution, are hung in irons or chains, as spectacles in terrorem. The word in French, gibet, properly denotes what we call gallows; and it is supposed to come originally from the Arabic gibel, a mount, or elevation of ground, by reason that gibbets are usually placed on hills or eminences.
