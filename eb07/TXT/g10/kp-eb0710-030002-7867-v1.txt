The haven is connected by a mole, but the entrance is dangerous on account of the rocks. It is strongly fortified both on the land and the sea side. It contains, besides the cathedral, ten churches, an ecclesiastical seminary, with some other establishments for education, and, with the suburbs, 8141 inhabitants.
