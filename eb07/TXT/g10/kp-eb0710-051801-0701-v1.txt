GIFT, in the law of England, is a conveyance which passes either lands or goods, and is of a larger extent than a grant, being applied to things moveable and immoveable; yet as to things immoveable, when taken strictly, it is applicable only to lands and tenements given in tail. But gift and grant are too often confounded.

New Year’s Gifts, presents made on new year’s day, as a token of the giver’s good will, as well as by way of presage of a happy year. This practice is very ancient, the origin of it among the Romans being referred to Tatius king of the Sabines, who reigned at Rome conjointly with Romulus, and who, having considered as a good omen a present of some sprigs of vervain gathered in a wood consecrated to Strenia, the goddess of strength, which he received on the first day of the new year, authorized this custom afterwards, and gave to these presents the name of Strenoe. But however this may be, the Romans on that day celebrated a festival in honour of Janus; paid their respects at the same time to Juno; and avoided passing it in idleness, lest they should become indolent during the rest of the year. '1 hey sent presents to one another of figs, dates, honey, and other articles, to show their friends that they wished them a happy and agreeable life. Clients, that is to say, those who were under the protection of the great, carried presents of this kind to their patrons, adding to them a small piece of silver. Under Augustus, the senate, the knights, and the people, presented such gifts to the emperor, and in his absence deposited them in the Capitol. Of the succeeding princes, some adopted this custom, and others abolished it; but it always continued amongst the people. The early Christians condemned it, because it. appeared to be a relic of paganism, and a species of superstition; but when it began to have nó other object than that of being a mark of veneration and esteem, the church ceased to disapprove of it.
