GHENT, a city, the capital of the province of East Flanders. It stands on the river Scheldt, where it receives the waters of the Lys, the Lieve, and the More, and is connected with several navigable canals, which form twenty-six islands, over which there are many bridges. It contains about 10,000 houses, and 30,000 inhabitants. It is a sumptuously built ancient city, with many public buildings, some venerable for their antiquity, and others for their architecture. It was before 1830 a place of most extensive manufactures, which had grown up in the preceding fifteen years with a degree of rapidity which has no parallel on the Continent. The commerce and the benevolent institutions were, up to the same period, in a most meritorious state, and yet improving. It is to be hoped that peace may restore the city to its former state of prosperity. Long. 3. 38. 30. E. Lat. 51. 3. 21. N.
