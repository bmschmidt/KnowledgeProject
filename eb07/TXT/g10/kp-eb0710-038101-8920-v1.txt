GENERATOR, in Music, signifies the principal sound or sounds by which others are produced. Thus the lowest C for the treble of the harpsichord, besides its octave, will strike an attentive ear with its twelfth above, or G in alt, and with its seventeenth above, or E in alt. The C, therefore, is called their generator, the G and E its products or harmonics. But in the approximation of chords for G, its octave below is substituted, which constitutes a fifth from the generator, or lowest C; and for E, is likewise substituted its fifteenth below, which, with the above-mentioned C, forms a third major. To the lowest notes, therefore, exchanged for those in alt by substitution, the denominations of products or harmonics are likewise given, whilst the C retains the name of their generator. But still, according to the system of Tartini, two notes in concord, which when sounded produce a third, may be termed the concurring generators of that third. (See Génération Harmonique, by Μ. Rameau; also the delineation of Tartini’s system, called The Power and Principles of Harmony.)
