GALATAeA, or Galathaea, in fabulous history, a sea nymph, daughter of Nereus and Doris. She was passionately beloveα by the Cyclops Polyphemus, whom she treated with coldness and disdain; whilst Acis, a shepherd of Sicily, «enjoyed her unbounded affection. But the happiness of these two lovers was disturbed by the jealousy of the Cyclops, who crushed his rival to pieces with a piece of a broken rock whilst he reposed on the bosom of Galataea. The nymph was inconsolable for the loss oť Acis; and as she could not restore him to life, she changed him into a fountain.
