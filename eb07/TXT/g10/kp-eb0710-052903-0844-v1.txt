GISBOROUGH, a market-town of the north riding of the county of York, in the wapentake of East Langborough. It is situated at the mouth of the river Tees, where a bay is formed, having good anchorage for ships. This place worked some mines of alum; but the discovery of others of greater nchness has caused them to be given up. A priory once stood here, richly endowed, but there are no other remains of it except the superb arch of the east window. The narrow vale in which the town stands is highly fertile. The market is held on Saturday, and is well supplied. It is 248 miles from London. The population amounted in 1801 to 1719, in 1811 to 1834, in 1821 to 2180, and in 1831 to 2210.
