GANJAM, a town and sea-port of Hindustan, in the Northern Circars, and capital of a district of the same name. It is situated on the north-eastern bank of a river, which is only navigable during the rainy season, when a great part of the surrounding country is inundated. It possesses a fort, which is a regular pentagon on plain ground, well fortified, and capable, when properly garrisoned, of making a respectable defence. Ganjam is one of the five districts into which the Northern Circars have been subdivided, and is the residence of a judge and collector. This port is much frequented by country vessels; and formerly the East India Company were provided with a large investment from it. But since the great improvements which have taken place in the cotton manufactures in England, the demand for India cotton goods has greatly decreased, and the establishment now scarcely pays its expenses. Long. 85. 19. E. Lat. 19. 23. N. The district of Ganjam is in Cicacole, and one of the Northern Circars.
