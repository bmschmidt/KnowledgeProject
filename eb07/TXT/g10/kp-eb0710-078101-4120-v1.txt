GROSS, amongst us, means twelve dozen .

Gross H eight, is the weight 0 f merchandise and goods Γ i Ä . a h V n r ° 8s, a8 ∙ also ° , ' the ba S- cask > chest, &c. in which they are contamed; and out of this gross weight allowance is to be made for tare and tret.

Gross, or Grossus, in our ancient law writers, denotes a thing absolute, and not depending on another. Thus, villein in gross, villanus in grosso, was a servant who did not belong to the land, but immediately to the person of the lord; or a servile person not appended or annexed to the lord or manor, or an accessory of the tenures as an appurtenant, but, like other personal goods and chattels of his lord, at his lord’s pleasure and disposal.
