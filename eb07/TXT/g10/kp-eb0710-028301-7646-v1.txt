GALATZ, a city of Moldavia, in the circle of Kohur-lui. It is built on the banks of the Danube, is surrounded with walls, and is by far the best-constructed city in the whole principality. It contains seven Greek churches, 1200 houses, and 7000 resident inhabitants, besides nuπιe-rous strangers always resorting t o it as the chief place of trade for both Wallachia and Moldavia. These consist of Greeks, Arminians, and Jews, who bring German and Austrian manufactured goods, and some from more distant countries. The harbour in the river is very good, and admits ships of 300 tons to lie close to the quays. There are many vessels built as well for sea as for river navigation. Long. 28. 17. E. Lat. 45.24. N.
