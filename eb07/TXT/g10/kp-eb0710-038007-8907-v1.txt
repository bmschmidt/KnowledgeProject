GENERAL, an appellation given to whatever belongs to a whole genus.

General, in the art of war, he who commands a brigade, a division, a corps, or an army. See Army. General is also used for the chief of an order of monks, or of all the houses and congregations established under the same rule. Thus we say the general of the Franciscans, Cistertians, and so on.
