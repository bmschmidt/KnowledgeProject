GREAT, a term of comparison, denoting that one thing has more extension than some other to which it is referred. Thus we say, a great space, a great distance, a great figure, a great body, and the like.

Great is likewise used figuratively in matters of morality, &c. to signify ample, noble, elevated, extraordinary, important, and the like. Thus we say, Shakspeare was a great genius, Da Vinci a great painter, Galileo a great philosopher, Bossu a great critic, and so on.

Great is also a title or quality appropriated to certain princes and other illustrious personages. Thus we say, the great Turk, the great Mogul, the great Khan of Tartary, the great Duke of Florence.
