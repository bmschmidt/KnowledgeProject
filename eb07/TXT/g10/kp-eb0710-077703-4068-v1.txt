GRIMALDI, Fbancisco, an eminent painter, generally known by the appellation of Bolognese, was born at Bologna in 1606, where he became a disciple of Annibal Caracci, and proved an honour to that illustrious master. From the school of Annibal he went to âˆžmplete his studies at Rome, and improved himself daily by copying the works of those artists in which he observed the greatest excellence. He died of a dropsy at Rome in 1680, and left a considerable fortune to his children. The genius of Grimaldi directed him chiefly to landscape, which he executed most happily. His colouring is strong, and his touch light and delicate; his situations are uncommonly pleasing, and the leafing of his trees is admirable.
