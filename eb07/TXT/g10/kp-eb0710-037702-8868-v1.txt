GEHENNA, a Scripture term which has given some trouble to the critics. The authors of the Louvain and Geneva versions retain the word gehenna as it stands in the Greek, and so does Μ. Simon; the English translators render it by “hell” and “hell-fire,” and so do the translators of Mons and Father Bohours. The word is formed from the Hebrew gehinnom, or valley of Hinnom. In that valley, which was near Jerusalem, there was a place named Tophet, where some Jews sacrificed their children to Moloch, by making them pass through the fire. King Josias, to render this place for ever abominable, made it a cloaca or common sewer, into which all the filth and carcasses in the city were thrown. The Jews further observed, that there was a continual fire kept there to burn and consume those carcasses; for which reason, as they had no proper term in their language to signify “hell,” they made use of gehenna or gehinnom to denote a fire unextinguishable.
