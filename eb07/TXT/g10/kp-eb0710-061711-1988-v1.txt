GOTEBORG, or Gottenbvrg, a province in the southern part of Sweden. It is bounded on the north by Norway, on the east by Elfsborg, on the south by Halland, and on the west by the German Ocean. It extends over 1894 square miles, is divided into five bailiwicks, comprehends five cities or towns, and 2891 rural establishments; and has a population of 119,504 individuals. The surface is generally mountainous, but has some plains in the southern parts; but even in these, the soil is so thin as to be scantily productive. The chief food of the inhabitants, as well as the chief exports, consists of fish, which abound on the coasts and in the rivers.
