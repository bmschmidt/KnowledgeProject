GENEALOGICA Arbor, or Tree of Consanguinity, signifies a genealogy or lineage drawn out under the figure of a tree, with its root, trunk or stem, and branches. The genealogical degrees are usually represented in circles, ranged over, under, and beside each other. This the Greeks called stemmata, a word signifying crown, garland, or the like.
