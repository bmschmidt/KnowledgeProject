GENEVIEVE, Fathers or Religious of, the name of a congregation of regular canons of the order of St Augustin, established in France. The congregation takes its name from the abbey of St Genéviève, which is the chief of the order, and whose abbot is the general thereof. The abbey itself took its name from St Genéviève, the patroness of the city of Paris, who died in the year 512. Five years after her death, Clovis erected the church of St Genéviève, under the name and invocation of St Peter, where her relics are still, or were till lately preserved, her shrine visited, and her image carried in procession with great ceremony upon extraordinary occasions.
