GOSHEN, a canton of Egypt, which Joseph procured for his father and his brethren when they came to dwell in that country. It was the most fruitful part of the country; and its name seems to be derived from the Hebrew, Geshem, which signifies â€œrain because this province lying very near the Mediterranean, was exposed to rains, which were very rare in other cantons, and more especially in Upper Egypt.
