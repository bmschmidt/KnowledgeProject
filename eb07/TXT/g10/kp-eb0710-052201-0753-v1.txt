GILEAD, the son of Machir, and grandson of Manasseh, had his inheritance allotted him in the mountains of Gilead, whence he took his name. The mountains of Gilead were part of the ridge which runs from Mount Lebanon southward, on the east of the Holy Land; and they gave their name to the whole country which lies on the east of the sea of Galilee, and includes the mountainous region called in the New Testament Trachonitis.
