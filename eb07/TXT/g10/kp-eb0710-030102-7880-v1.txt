GALLOP, in the manege, is the swiftest natural pace of a horse, performed by reaches or leaps; the two forefeet being raised almost at the same time, and when these are in the air, and just ready to touch the ground again, the two hind feet arc lifted almost at once. The word is borrowed from the barbarous Latin calupare, or calpare, to run. Some, however, derive it from caballicare ; and others from the Greek καλταζso, to spur a horse.
