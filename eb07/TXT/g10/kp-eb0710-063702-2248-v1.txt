GRAFTING, or Engrafting, in Gardening, is the taking a shoot from one tree, and inserting it into another, in such a manner that both may unite closely and become one tree. By the ancient writers on husbandry and gardening, this operation is called incision, to distinguish it from inoculation or budding, which they call inserere oculos.
