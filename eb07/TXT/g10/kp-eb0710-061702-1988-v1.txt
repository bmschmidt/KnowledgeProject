GORLAeUS, Abraham, an eminent antiquary, bom at Antwerp, who gained a great reputation by collecting medals and other antique remains. He was chiefly fond of the rings and seals of the ancients, of which he published a prodigious number in 1601, under the title of Dactyliotheca ; sive Annulorum Sigillarium, quorum apud priscos tam Gτ<εcos quam Romanos usus ex ferro, cere, argento, et auro, Promptuarium. This was the first part of the work; the second, entitled Variarum Gemmarum, quibus antiquitas in signando uti solita sculptures, appeared afterwards. This work has undergone several editions, the best of which is that of Leyden, 1695, containing a great number of cuts, and also a short explanation of these by Gronovius. In 1680 he published a collection of medals, which, however, if we may believe the Scaligerana, it is not safe always to trust. Gorlaeus selected Delft as the place of his residence, and died there in 1609.
