GABRES, or GÎ»vres, called also Gebres, Guebres, Gevres, and Giaours, a religious sect in Persia and India. The lurks call the Christians Giaours, or people of a false religion, or rather, as Leunclavius observes, Heathens or Gentiles; the word amongst the Turks having the same signification as Pagan or Infidel amongst the Christians, and denoting any thing not Mahommedan. In Persia the word has a more peculiar signification, being applied to a sect dispersed throughout the country, and said to be the remains of the ancient Persians, or followers of Zoroaster.
