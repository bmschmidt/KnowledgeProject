ADRASTEA, in Mythology, was the daughter of Jupiter and Necessity, and, according to Plutarch, the only fury who executed the vengeance of the gods. The name is derived from King Adrastus, who first erected a temple to that deity.

Adrastea Certamina, in Antiquity, a kind of Pythian games instituted by Adrastus, king of Argos, in the year of the world 2700, in honour of Apollo, at Sicyon. These are to be distinguished from the Pythian games celebrated at Delphi.
