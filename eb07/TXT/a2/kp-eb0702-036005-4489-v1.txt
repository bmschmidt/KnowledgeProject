AGUR. The xxxth chapter of the Proverbs begins with this title,—“The words of Agur, the son of Jakeb which, according to the signification of the original terms, may be translated, as the Vulgate has it, Verba congre- ∣ gantis, filii vomentis; which translation Le Clerc condemns, supposing these to be proper names which ought not to be translated. These words are rendered by Louis de Dieu, “the words of him who has recollected himselζ the son of obedience.” The generality of the fathersand commentators will have it that Solomon describes himself under the name of Agur the son of Jakeh; others conjecture that Agur, as well as Lemuel (in chap. xxxi. 1), were wise men who lived in the timo of Solomon, and were his interlocutors in the book of Proverbs; an opinion which F. Calmet thinks is without the least show of probability, this book being nothing like a dialogue. This last expositor thinks it probable that Agur was an inspired author different from Solomon, whose sentences it was thought fit to join with those of this prince, because of the conformity of their matter.
