AGNOETAe (from αy≡w, to be ignorant of), in church history, a sect of ancient heretics, who maintained that Christ, considered as to his human nature, was ignorant of certain things, and particularly of the time of the day of judgment. Eulogius, patriarch of Alexandria, ascribes this heresy to certain solitaries in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, who built their opinion upon the text, Mark xiii. 32, “Of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not the angels who are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father only.” The same passage was made use of by the Arians; and hence the orthodox divines of those days were induced to give various explications thereof. Some allege that our Saviour here had no regard to his divine nature, but only spoke of his human. Others understand it thus: that the knowledge of the day of judgment does not concern our Saviour considered in his quality of Messiah, but of God.
