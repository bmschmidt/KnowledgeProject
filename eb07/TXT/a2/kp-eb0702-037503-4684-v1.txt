ALB, or Albe, in the Romish Church, a vestment of white linen-hanging down to the feet, and answering to the surplice of the English clergy. In the ancient church it was usual with those newly baptized to wear an alb, or white vestment; and hence the Sunday after Easter was called dominica in albis, 0 n account of the albs worn by the baptized on Easter-day.

Alb is also a name of a Turkish coin, otherwise called Î±sper.
