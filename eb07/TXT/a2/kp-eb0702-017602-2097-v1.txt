AERA, in Chronology, a fixed point of time from whenee any number of years is begun to be counted. It is sometimes also written in aneient authors Era. The origin of the term is contested, though it is generally allowed to have had its rise in Spain. Sepulveda supposes it formed from A. ER. A. the notae or abbreviatures of the words annus erat Augusti, occasioned by the Spaniards beginning their computation from the time their country eame under the dominion of Augustus, or that of receiving the Roman calendar. This opinion, however ingenious, is rejected by Sealiger, not only on aeeountthat in the aneient abbreviatures A never stood for annus, unless when preceded by V for vixit ; but that it seems improbable they should put ER for erat, and the letter A, without any discrimination, both for annus and Augustus. Vossius nevertheless favours the eonjeeture, and judges it at least as probable as either that of Isidore, who derives aera from aes, the tribute-money wherewith Augustus taxed the world; or that of Sealiger himself, who deduces it likewise from aes, though in a different manner. Aes, he observes, was used among the ancients for an article or item in an aeeount; and hence it eame also to stand for a sum or number itself. From the plural aera, eame by corruption aera, aerum, in the singular; mueh as Ostia, Ostiam, the name of a plaee, from Ostia, the mouths of the Tiber.

The difference between the terms aera and epoch is, that the aeras are certain points fixed by some people or nation, and the epoehs are points fixed by ehronologists and historians. The idea of an aera comprehends also a certain succession of years proceeding from a fixed point of time, and the epoeh is that point itself. Thus, the Christian aera began at the epoeh of the birth of Jesus Christ.
