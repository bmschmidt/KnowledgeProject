There are the ruins of a castle here, whieh is supposed by some to have been built before the Norman conquest; but Dr Plot is of opinion that it was erected by Theobald de Verdun in the beginning of the reign of Edward II. A great part of the walls are still standing, but they are in a very ruinous condition.
