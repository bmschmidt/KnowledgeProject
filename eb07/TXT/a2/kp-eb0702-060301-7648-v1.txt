AMBROSIA, in Heathen Antiquity, denotes the solid food of the gods, in contradistinction to their drink, which was called nectar. It had the appellation ambrosia, compounded of the particle α privative, and βgοτος, mortal, as being supposed to render those immortal who fed on it.

Ambrosia is also a splendid kind of title, given by some physicians to certain alexipharmic compositions of extraordinary virtue. The name was particularly given to a famous antidote of Philip of Macedon against all poisons, bites, and stings of venomous creatures, as well as many internal diseases.
