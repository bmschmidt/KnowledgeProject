ANACLINOPALE, Avα%λ∕voffαλ}⅛ in Antiquity, a kind of wrestling, wherein the champions threw themselves voluntarily on the ground, and continued the combat by pinching, biting, scratching, and other methods of offence. The Anaclinopαle was contradistinguished from the Or-thapale, wherein the champions stood erect. In the Anaclinopale the weaker combatants sometimes gained the victory.
