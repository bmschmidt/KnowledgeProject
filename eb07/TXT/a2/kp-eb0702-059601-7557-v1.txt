AMBOULE, a province of Madagascar, somewhat to the northward of lat. 23. S. It is a fertile and agreeable country, watered by the river Manampani, whose mouth lies in lat. 23.30. S. The country produces plants and fruits in plenty. Iron mines are also found here. The blackcattle are extremely fat, and their flesh excellent. In this province stands a large town of the same name, near which is a fountain of hot water, within 20 feet of a small river whose sand is almost burning. The water of the fountain is said to boil an egg hard in two hours; and the inhabitants affirm it to be a sovereign remedy against the gout. The people here are employed in different preparations of iron and steel, and forge several instruments with tolerable skill.
