ALLEYN, Edward, a celebrated English actor in the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, and founder of the college of Dulwich in Surrey, was born at London, in the parish of St Botolph, on the 1st of September 1566, as appears from a memorandum of his own writing. Dr Füller says that he was bred a stage-player, and that his father would have given him a liberal education, but that he was not turned for a serious eourse of life. > He was, however, a youth of an excellent eapacity, a eheerful temper, a tenacious memory, a sweet eloeution, and in his person of a stately port and aspeet; all which advantages might well induce a young man to take to the theatrical profession. By several authorities we find he must have been on the stage some time before 1592; for at that time he was in high favour with the town, and greatly applauded by the best judges, particularly by Ben Jonson.

Haywood, in his prologue to Marlow’s Jew of Malta, calls him Proteus for shapes, and Roseius for a tongue. He usually played the capital parts, and was one of the original actors in Shakspeare’s plays; in some of Ben Jonson’s he was also a principal performer: but what characters he personated in any of thqir plays, it is difficult now to determine. This is owing ,to the inaeeu-racy of their editors,, who did not print the names of the players opposite to, the characters they performed, as the modern custom is; but gave one general list of actors to the whole set of plays, as in the old folio edition of Shak-speare; or divided one from the other, setting the dramatis personae before the plays, and the catalogue of performers after them, as in Jonson’s.

It may appear surprising how one of Mr Alleyn’s profession should be enabled to ereet sueh an edifiee as Dulwich College, and liberally endow it for the maintenance θf so many persons. But it must be observed that he had some paternal fortune, whieh, though small, might lay a foundation for his future affluenee; and it is to be presumed, that the profits he received from aeting, to one of his provident and managing disposition, and one who by his excellence in playing drew after him sueh erowds of spectators, must have considerably improved his fortune: besides, he was not only aetor, but master of a playhouse built at his own expense, by whieh he is said to have amassed considerable wealth. He was also keeper of the king’s wild beasts, or master of the. royal bear-garden, which was frequented by vast erowds of spectators; and the profits arising from these sports are said to have amounted to L.500 per annum. He was thriee married; and the portions of his first two wives, they leaving him uo issue to inherit, might probably contribute to this benefaction. Such donations have been frequently thought to proeeed more from vanity and ostentation than real piety; but this of Mr Alleyn has been aseribed to a very singular cause, for the devil has been said to be the first promoter of it. Mr Aubrey mentions a tradition, that Mr Alleyn playing a demon, with six others, in one of Shakspeare’s plays, was in the midst of the play surprised by an apparition of the devil; whieh so worked on his fancy, that he made a vow, whieh he performed by building Dulwich College. He began the foundation of this eollege, un der, the direction of Inigo Jones, in 1614; and the buildings, gardens, &c. were finished in 1617, in which he is said to have expended about L.10,000. After the eollege was built, he met with some difficulty in obtaining a eharter for settling his lands in mortmain; for he proposed to endow it with L.800 per annum, for the maintenance of one master, one warden, and four fellows, three whereof were to be clergymen, and the fourth a skilful organist; also six poor men and as many women, besides twelve poor boys to bę educated till the age of fourteen or sixteen, and then put out to some trade or ealling. The obstruction he met with arose from the lord ehancellor Baeon, who wished King James to settle part of those lands for support of two academical lectures; and he wrote a letter to the marquis of Buckingham, dated August 18, 1618, entreating him to use his interest with his majesty for that purpose. Mr Alleyn’s solicitation was, however, at last complied with, and he obtained the royal licence, giving him full power.to lay his foundation, by his majesty’s letters patent, bearing date the 21st of June 1619; by virtue whereof lie did, in the ehapel at the said new hospital at Dulwich, called The College oj God's Gift, on the 13th of September following, publiely read and publish a quadripartite writing in parchment, whereby he created and established the said college; he then subscribed it with his name, and fixed his seal to several parts thereof, in presenee of several honourable persons, and ordered eopies of the writings to four different parishes· He was himself the first master of his eollege; so that, to make use of the words of Mr Haywood, one of his contemporaries, ‘ He was t so mingled with humility and eharity, that he became his own pensioner, humbly submitting himself to that proportion of diet and elothes whieh he had bestowed on others.’ We have no reason to think he ever repented of this distribution of his substanee; but, on the contrary, that he was entirely satisfied, as appears from the following memorial in his own writing, found amongst his papers.—‘ May 26, 1620. My wife and I acknowledged the fine at the eommon pleas bar, of all our lands to the college: blessed be God that he hath given us life to do it.’” His wife died in the year 1623; and about two years afterwards he married Constance Kinehtoe, who survived him, and received remarkable proofs of his affeetion, if at least we may judge of it by his will, in whieh he left her considerable property. He died on the 25th of November 1626, in the 61st year of his age, and was buried in the ehapel.of his new college, where there is a tomb-stone over his grave, with an inscription. His original diary is also there preserved.

The subjoining aneedote is entertaining in itself, and shows the high esteem in which Mr Alleyn was held as an aetor :—“Edward Alleyn, the Garriek of Shakspeare’s time, had been on the most friendly footing with our poet, as well as Ben Jonson. They used frequently to spend their evenings together at the sign of the Globe, somewhere near Blaekfriars, where the playhouse then was. The world need not be told, that the eonvivial hours of such a triumvirate must be pleasing aş well as.profitable, and may be said to be .sueh pleasures as might bear the refleetions of the morning. In eonsequenee of one of these meetings, the following letter was written by G. Peele, a student of Christ Church College, Oxford, and a dramatie poet, who belonged to the Club, to one Marle, an intimate of his [7:2:526] ‘ Friend Marle,

‘ I must desyr that my syster hyr watch, and the cookerie book you promysed, may be sente bye the man. I never longed for thy company more than last night: we were all very merrye at the Globe, when Ned Alleyn did not scruple to affyrme pleasauntly to thy Friende Will, that he had stolen his speech about thee Qualityes of art actor’s excellencye in Hamlet hys Tragedye, from conversations manyfold which had passed betweene them, and opinyons given by Alleyn touching the subjecte. Shakspeare did not take this talke in good sorte; but Janson put an ende to the strife with wittylye remarkinge, This affaire needeth no Contentione; you stole it from Ned, no doubte; do not marvel: Have you not seen him act tymes out of number?— Believe me most syncerilie yours, G. Peele. ’”
