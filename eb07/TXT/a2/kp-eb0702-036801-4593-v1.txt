AIRANI, in Church History, an obscure sect of Arians in the fourth century, who denied the con substantiality of the Holy Ghost with the Father and the Son. They are otherwise called Airanists; and are said to have taken their name from one Airos, who distinguished himself at the head of this party in the reigns of Valentinian and Gratian.
