ABSTINENTS, or Abstinentes, a set of heretics that appeared in France and Spain about the end of the third century. They are supposed to have borrowed part of their opinions from the Gnostics and Manicheans, because they opposed marriage, condemned the use of flesh' meat, and placed the Holy Ghost in the class of created beings. We have, however, no certain account of their peculiar tenets.
