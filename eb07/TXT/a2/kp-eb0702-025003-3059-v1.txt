AGRARIAN Laws, among the Romans, those relating to the division and distribution of lands; of which there were a great number; but that called the Agrarian Law, by way of eminence, was published by Spurius Cassius, about the year of Rome 268, for dividing the conquered lands equally among all the citizens, and limiting the number of acres which each citizen might enjoy. For some learned and ingenious inquiries on this subject, see Niebuhrâ€™s Roman History.
