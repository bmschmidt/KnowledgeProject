ABYDOS, in Ancient Geography, anciently a town built by the Milesians, in Asia, on the Hellespont, where it is scarce a mile broad, opposite to Sestos, on the European side. It was famous for Xerxesâ€™s bridge, and for the loves of Leander and Hero (Musaeus, Ovid); celebrated also for its oysters (Ennius, Virgil). The old castle of the Dardanelles, built by the Turks, lies a little southward of Sestos and Abydos.
