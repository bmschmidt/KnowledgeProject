ACIDUM Aereum, the same with fixed air; or, in modern chemistry, carbonic acid. ACIDUÎœ pingue, an imaginary acid, which some German[7:2:106] chemists supposed to be contained in fire, and by combining with alkalies, lime, &c. to give them their caustic properties; an effect which is found certainly to depend on the loss of their carbonic acid.
