AMENTUM, in Botany, the name of a speeies of ealyx, consisting of valves, and hanging down in different directions from the eaulis. Common oats afford a good example of the amentum.

Amentum, in Roman Antiquity, a thong tied about the middle of a javelin or dart, and fastened to the fore-finger, in order to recover the weapon as soon as it was diseharged. The ancients made much use of the amentum, thinking it helped to enforce the blow. It also denotes a latchet that bound their sandals.
