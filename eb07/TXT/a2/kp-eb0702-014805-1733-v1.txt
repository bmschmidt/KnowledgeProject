ADELSCALC, in ancient customs, denotes a servant of the king. The word is also written adclscalche, and adelscalus. It is compounded of the German adel, or edel, noble, and scale, servant. Among the Bavarians, adel-scalcs appear to have been the same with royal thanes among the Saxons, and those called ministri regis in ancient charters.
