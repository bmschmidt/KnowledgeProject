AFFORESTING, Afforestatio, the turning of ground into forest. The Conqueror and his successors continued afforesting the lands of the subject for many reigns, till the grievance became so notorious, that the people of all degrees and denominations were brought to sue for relief; which was at length obtained, and commissions were granted to survey and perambulate the forest, and separate all the new-afforested lands, and reconvert them to the uses of their proprietors, under the name and quality of purlieu or pouralle land.
