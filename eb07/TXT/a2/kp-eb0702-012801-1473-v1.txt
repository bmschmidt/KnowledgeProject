ACRISIUS, in fabulous history, king of Argos, being told by the oracle that he should be killed by his grandchild, shut up his only daughter Danäe in a brazen tower; but Jupiter coming ’down in a golden shower, begot Perseus by her. After Perseus had slain the Gorgons, he carried Medusa’s head to Argos; which Acrisius seeing, was turned into a statue.
