AEGEUS, in fabulous history, was king of Athens, and the father of Theseus. The Athenians having basely killed the son of Minos, king of Crete, for carrying away the prize from them, Minos made war upon them; and being victorious, imposed this severe condition on Aegeus, that he should annually send into Crete seven of the noblest of the Athenian youths, chosen by lot, to be devoured by the Minotaur. On the fourth year of this tribute, the choice fell on Theseus; or, as others say, he himself entreated to be sent. The king, at his son’s departure, gave orders, that as the ship sailed with black sails, it should return with the same in case he perished; but, if he became victorious, he should change them into white. When Theseus returned to Crete, after killing tlιe Minotaur, and forgot to change the sails in token of his victory, according to the agreement with his father, the latter, who watched the return of the vessel, supposing by the black sails that his son was dead, cast himself headlong into the sea, which afterwards obtained the name of the Aegcan Sea. The Athenians decreed Aegeus divine honours, and sacrificed to him as a marine deity the adopted son of Neptune.
