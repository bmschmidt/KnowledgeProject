ABATELMENT, in commerce, a term used for a prohibition of trade to all French merchants in the ports of the Levant who will not stand to their bargains, or refuse to pay their debts. It is a sentence of the French eonsul, which must be taken off before they can sue any person for the payment of their debts.
