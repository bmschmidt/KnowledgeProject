ACHAeUS, cousin-german to Seleucus Ceraunus and Antiochus the Great, kings of Syria, became a very powerful monarch, and enjoyed the dominions he had usurped for many years; but at last he was punished for his usurpations in a dreadful manner, in the 140th year of Rome, as related by Polybius.^[1. Lib. iii. cap. 56.]
