ALDERNEY, an island in the British channel, subject to the crown of Great Britain. It is about eight miles in compass, and is separated from Cape la Hogue, in Normandy, by a narrow strait, called the Pace of Alderney, which is a very dangerous passage in stormy weather, when the two currents meet; otherwise it is safe, and has depth of water for the largest ships. Through this strait the French fleet made their escape after their defeat at La Hogue in 1692. It is a healthful island, has but one church, is fruitful both in corn and pasture, and is remarkable for a fine breed of cows. The inhabitants live together in a town of the same name. It has but one harbour, called Crabby, which is at a good distance from the town, and is only fit for small vessels. To the west lie the range of rocks called the Caskets, so dangerous to mariners. Long. 2. 7. W. Lat. 49. 45. N.
