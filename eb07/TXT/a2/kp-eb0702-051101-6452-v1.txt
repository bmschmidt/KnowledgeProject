ALGOA Bay, or Zwart-hops, in Southern Africa, is situated in long. 26. 53. E. lat. 33. 56. S. and 500 miles distant from the Cape of Good Hope. Mr Barrow, who visited this place, found, in an adjoining valley, a species of antelope called the riet-boh, or red-goat, previously unknown to naturalists. The land in its vicinity is more fertile than in most other parts of the Cape settlement, in consequence of which an English colony has been formed there; but it has hitherto somewhat disappointed the expectations formed from it. See Good Hope, Cape of.
