ADVANCED, in a general sense, denotes something posted or situated before another. Thus, ADVANCED Ditch, in Fortification, is that which surrounds the glacis or esplanade of a place.

Advanced Guard, or Vanguard, in the art of war, the first line or division of an army, ranged or marching in order of battle; or, it is that part which is next the enemy, and marches first towards them.

Advanced Guard is more particularly used for a small party of horse stationed before the main guard.
