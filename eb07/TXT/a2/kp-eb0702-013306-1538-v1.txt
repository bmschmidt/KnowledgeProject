ACTUATE, to bring into act, or put a thing in action. Thus an agent is said, by the schoolmen, to actuate a power, when it produces an act in a subject. Thus the mind may be said to actuate the body; and thus a medicine is said, by ancient physicians, to be actuated or brought into action, when by means of the vital heat it is made to produce its effect.
