AMBARVALIA, in Antiquity, a ceremony amon°∙ the Romans, when, in order to procure from the gods a happy harvest, they conducted the victims thrice round the cornfields in procession before sacrificing them. Arnbαrvαliα were either of a private or public nature: the private were performed by the master of a family, and the public by the priests who officiated at the solemnity called fratres arvales. The prayer preferred on this occasion, the formula of which we have in Cato de Re Rustica, cap. cxlii. was called carmen ambarυale. At these feasts they sacrificed to Ceres a sow, a sheep, and a bull or heifer; whence they took the name of suovetaurilia. The method of celebrating them was, to lead a victim round the fields, while the peasants accompanied it, and one of their number, crowned with oak, hymned forth the praises of Ceres, in verses composed on purpose. This festival was celebrated twice a year; at the end of January, according to some, or in April, according to others; and, for the second time, in the month of July.
