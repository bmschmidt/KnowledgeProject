ADAR, the name of a Hebrew month, answering to the end of February and beginning of March, the 12th of their sacred and 6th of their civil year. On the 7th day of it the Jews keep a fast for the death of Moses; on the 13th they have the feast of Esther; and on the 14th they celebrate the feast of Purim, for their deliverance from Hamanâ€™s conspiracy. As the lunar year, which the Jews followed in their calculations, is shorter than the solar by about eleven days, which at the end of three years make a month, they then intercalate a thirteenth month, which they call Veadar, or the second Adar.
