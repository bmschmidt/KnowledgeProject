ALTELAND, a district in the province of Bremen, in the kingdom of Hanover, denominated a royal justiceship, hėnigliche Gerichte. It is situated on the barfkś of the Elbe, and is divided into three portions by the small rivers Schwinge, Este, and Lube, which cross it. The extent is 'θ square miles, or 50,560 acres. The soil is peculiarly fertile, and produces bountiful crops öf corn, rapeseed, flax, garden and orchard fruits; and on the meadows large herds of cattle are depastured. The inhabitants amount to 14,125, mostly living on separate farms, in prosperous circumstances, and enjoy some peculiar privileges. By means of the rivers which cross this narrow strip of land there is a communication with the Elbe, which affords easy access to the large cities on that river.
