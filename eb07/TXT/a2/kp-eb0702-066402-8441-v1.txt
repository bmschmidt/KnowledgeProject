AMNESTY, in matters of policy, denotes a pardon granted by a prince to his rebellious subjects, usually with some exceptions: such was that granted by Charles II. at his restoration. The word is formed from the Greek αμνίΰτιοο, the name of an edict of this kind published by Thrasybulus, on his expulsion of the tyrants out of Athens.
