ANAGRAM (from the Greek αvα, backwards, and γζaμμa, letter), in matters of literature, a transposition of the letters of some name, whereby a new word is formed, either to the advantage or disadvantage of the person or thing to which the name belongs: thus the anagram of Galenus is angelus ; that of Logica, caligo ; that of Alstedius, sedulitas. Calvin, in the title of his Institutions, printed at Strasburg in 1539, calls himself Al-cuinus, which is the anagram of Calvinus, and the name of an eminently learned person in the time of Charlemagne, who contributed greatly to the restoration of learning in that age.

Those who adhere strictly to the definition of an ana [7:2:682] gram take no other liberty than that of omitting or retaining the letter H at pleasure; whereas others make no scruple to use e for ae, v for w, s for z, and c for κ; and vice versa. Besides anagrams formed as above, we meet with another kind in ancient writers, made by dividing a single word into several; thus, sus tinea mus are formed out of the word sustineamus. Anagrams are sometimes also made out of several words; such as that on the question put by Pilate to our Saviour, Quid est veritas? whereof we have this admirable anagram, viz. Est vir qui adest.

The cabbalists among the Jews are professed anagram-matists; the third part of their art, which they call the-rnuru, i. e. changing, being nothing but the art of making anagrams, or finding hidden and mystical meanings in names; which they do by changing, transposing, and differently combining the letters of those names. Thus, of ∏≡, the letters of Noah’s name, they make ∏, grace; of rτ'orn, the Messiah., they make πnur>, he shall rejoice.
