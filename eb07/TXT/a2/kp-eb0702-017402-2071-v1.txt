AEOLIS, or Aeolia, in Ancient Geography, a country of the Hither Asia, settled by colonies of Aeolian Greeks. Taken largely, it comprehends all Troas and the coast of the Hellespont to the Propontis, because in those parts there were several Aeolian colonies. In a more limited sense it is applied to the district between Troas to the north and Ionia to the south. The people are called Aeoles or Aeolii.
