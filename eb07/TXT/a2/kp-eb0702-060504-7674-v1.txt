AMENDMENT, in a general sense, denotes some alteration or ehange made in a thing for the better.

Amendment, in Law, the correction of an error committed in a process, which may be amended after judgment, unless the error lies in giving judgment; for in that ease it is not amendable, but the party must bring a writ of error. A bill may be amended on the file at any time before the plea is pleaded; but not afterwards, without motion and leave of the eourt.
