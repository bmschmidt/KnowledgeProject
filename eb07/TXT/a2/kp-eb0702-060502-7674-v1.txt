AMEN, ∙jnχ, signifies true, faithful, certain. It is made use of likewise to affirm any thing, and was a sort of affirmation used often by our Saviour: Αμήν, hμrμ, λtγω υμιν, ι. e. Verily, verily, I say unto you. Lastly, it is understood as expressing a wish: as, amen, so be it, Numb. v. 22; or an affirmation, amen ; yes, I believe it, 1 Cor. xiv. 16. The Hebrews end the five books of Psalms, according to their way of distributing them, with the words amxn, amen ; whieh the Septuagint have translated γ i wιτο, γtνοιη ; and the Latins flat, fiat. The Greek and Latin churches have preserved this word in their prayers, as well as alleluiah and hosannah; beeause they observed more energy in them than in any terms whieh they could use in their own languages. At the conclusion of the publie prayers, the people answered with a loud voiee, Amen; and St Jerome says, that at Rome, when the people answered amen, the sound of their voiees was like a clap of thunder: In similitudine coelestis tonitrui amen reboat. The Jews assert that the gates of heaven are opened to him who answers amen with all his might.
