AMAUROSIS, in Medicine, a deprivation of'sight, the eye remaining fair and seemingly unaffected. A perfect amaurosis is when the blindness is total. When there is still a power of distinguishing light from darkness, the disease is called by M. de St Ives an imperfect amaurosis. There is a periodical sort, which comes on instantaneously, continues for hours or days, and then disappears.
