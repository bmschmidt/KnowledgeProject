ABACK (a sea term), the situation of the sails when the surfaces are flatted against the masts by the force of the wind. The sails are said to be taken aback when they arc brought into this situation, either by a sudden change of the wind, or by an alteration in the shipâ€™s course. They are laid aback, to effect an immediate retreat, without turning to the right or left; or, in the sea phrase, to give the ship stern-way, in order to avoid some danger discovered before her in a narrow channel, or when she has advanced beyond her station in the line of battle, or otherwise. The sails are placed in this position by slackening their lec braces, and hauling in the weather ones; so that the whole effort of the wind is exerted on the fore part of their surface, which readily pushes the ship astern, unless she is restrained by some counteracting force.
