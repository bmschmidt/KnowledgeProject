ACONCROBA, in Botany, the indigenous name of a plant which grows wild in Guinea, and is in great esteem among the natives for its virtues in the small-pox. They give an infusion of it in wine. The leaves of this plant are opaque, and as stiff as those of the philyrea; they grow in pairs, and stand on short foot-stalks; they are small at each end, and broad in the middle; and the largest of them are about three inches in length, and an inch and a quarter in breadth in the middle. Like those of our bay, they are of a dusky colour on the upper side, and of a pale green underneath.
