AGORANOMUS, in Grecian Antiquity, a magistrate of Athens, who had the regulation of weights and measures, tlιe prices of provisions, &c.—The agoranomi, at Athens, were ten in number, five belonging to the city, and as many to the Piraeus; though others make them 15 in all, of whom they assign 10 to the city. To these a certain toll or tribute was paid by all who brought any thing to sell in the market.
