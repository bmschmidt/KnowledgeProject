ALICATA, a city of Sicily, in the intendancy of Cala-tanisera. It is a seaport and a parliamentary city, at the mouth of the river Salso, from which corn, fruit, and sulphur are exported. There is a roadstead, but no harbour. It contains 11,000 inhabitants. Near it are the vestiges of the ancient city of Gela.

Alicata, a mountain of Sicily, near the valleys Me-zara and Noto, upon which was situated, as is generally thought, the famous Daedalion, where the tyrant Phalaris kept his brazen bull.
