ABBA, in Ancient Geography, a town of Africa Propria, near Carthage.

Abba, in the Syriac and Chaldee languages, literally signifies a father ; and figuratively, a superior, reputed as a father in respect of age, dignity, or affection. It is more particularly used in the Syriac, Coptic, and Ethiopie churches, as a title given to the bishops. The bishops themselves bestow the title of Abba more eminently on the bishop of Alexandria; whieh occasioned the people to give him the title of Babba, or Papa, that is Grandfather ; a title which he bore before the bishop of Rome. It is a Jewish title of honour given to certain Rabbis called Tanaites : and it was particularly used, by some writers of the middle age, for the superior of a monastery, usually called abbot.
