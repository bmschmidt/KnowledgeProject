ALFAQUES, a seaport in the province of Catalonia, in Spain. It is on a peninsula formed by the river Ebro, near its mouth. The government has expended vast sums [7:2:415] in the improvement of this navigation, but without correspondent success, chiefly owing to the insalubrity of the situation.

Alfaques, among, the Moors, the name generally used for their clergy, or those who teach the Mahometan religion; in opposition to the Morabites, who answer to monks among Christians.
