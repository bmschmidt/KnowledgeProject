ALVEARIUM, in Anatomy, the bottom of the concha, or hollow of the outer ear.

Alvearium also signifies a bee-hive. The word is formed of alveus, channel or cavity, in allusion to the alveoli or cells in bee-hives. Some of the ancients also used the word alvearium for a bee-house, more usually called among us apiary. Alvearium is sometimes also used figuratively to denote a collection; in which sense alvearium amounts to much the same'with what we otherwise call thesaurus, cornucopia, or the like. Vine. Boreus has published an alvearium of law.
