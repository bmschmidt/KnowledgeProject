ALMONER, in its primitive sense, denotes an officer in religious houses, to whom belonged the management and distribution of the alms of the house. By the ancient canons, all monasteries were to spend at least a tenth part of their income in alms to the poor. The almoner of St Paul’s is to dispose of the moneys left for charity, according to the appointment of the donors, to bury the poor who die in the neighbourhood, and to breed up eight boys to singing, for the use of the choir. By an ancient canon, all bishops are required to keep almoners.

Lord ALMONER, or Lord High ALMONER of England, is an ecclesiastical officer, generally a bishop, who has the. forfeiture of all deodands, and the goods of felos de se, which he is to distribute among the poor. He has also, by virtue of an ancient custom, the power of giving the first dish from the king’s table to whatever poor person he pleases, or, instead of it, an alms in money.
