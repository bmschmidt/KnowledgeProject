ALCMAER, a city of the United Provinces, seated in North Holland, about four miles from the sea, 15 from Haerlem, and 18 from Amsterdam. The streets and houses are extremely neat and regular, and the public buildings very beautiful. It had formerly two parish churches, dedicated to St Matthew and St Lawrence. The latter had so high a tower, that it served for a seamark to the vessels that were in the open sea; but in 1464 it tumbled down, aud damaged the other church so much that they were both demolished in 1670, and one church was built in their stead, dedicated to the same [7:2:388] saints. The Spaniards, under the command of Frederick of Toledo, son of the duke of Alva, came to besiege it, after they had taken Haerlem in 1573; but were forced to raise the siege after lying three months before it, as well on account of the infection of the air, as the stout resistance of the inhabitants and soldiers; even the women signalizing themselves bravely in its defence. It is recorded in the register of this city, that, in the year 1637, 120 tulips, with the offsets, sold for 90,000 florins. The town has a very great trade in butter and cheese. It was taken by the British in 1799, but soon abandoned. Long. 4. 26. E. Lat. 52. 28. N.
