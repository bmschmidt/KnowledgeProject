AGRICOLA, Cnaeus Julius, born at Frejus, in Provence, was in Vespasian’s time made lieutenant to Vet-tius Bolanus in Britain; and upon his return was ranked by that emperor among the patricians, and made governor of Aquitania. This post he held for three years; and upon his return was chosen consul, and afterwards appointed governor of Britain, where he greatly distinguished himself. He reformed many abuses occasioned by the avarice or negligence of former governors, put a stop to extortion, and caused justice to be impartially administered. Vespasian dying about this time, his son Titus, knowing the great merit of Agricola, continued him in the government. In the spring he marched towards the north, where he made some new conquests, and ordered forts to be built for the Romans to winter in. He spent the following winter in concerting schemes to bring the Britons to conform to the Roman customs. He thought the best way of diverting them from rising and taking arms was to soften their rough manners, by proposing to them new kinds of pleasure, and inspiring them with a desire of imitating the Roman manners. Soon after this the country was adorned with magnificent temples, porticoes, baths, and many other fine buildings. The British nobles had at length their sons educated in learning; and they who before had the utmost aversion to the Roman language, now began to study it with great assiduity. They wore likewise the Roman habit; and, as Tacitus observes, they were brought to consider those things as marks of politeness, which were only so many badges of slavery. Agricola, in his third campaign, advanced as far as the Tweed; and in his fourth he subdued the nations betwixt the Tweed and the friths of Edinburgh and Clyde, into which the rivers Glotta and Bodotria discharge themselves; and here he built fortresses to shut up the nations yet unconquered. In his fifth he marched beyond the friths, where he made some new acquisitions, and fixed garrisons along the western coasts, over against Ireland. In his sixth [7:2:251] campaign he passed the river Bodotria; ordering his fleet, the first which the Romans ever had in those parts, to row along the coasts, and take a view of the northern parts. In the following spring, the Britons raised an army of 30,000 men; and the command was given to Galgacus, who, according to Tacitus, made an excellent speech to his countrymen on this occasion. Agricola likewise addressed his men in very strong and eloquent terms. The Romans gained the victory, and 10,000 of the Britons are said to have been killed. This happened in the reign of the emperor Domitian, who, growing jealous of the glory of Agricola, recalled him, under pretence of making him governor of Syria. Agricola died soon after; and his death is suspected to have been occasioned by poison given him by that emperor. Tacitus the historian married his daughter, wrote his life, and laments his death in the most pathetic manner.

Agricola, George, a German physician, famous for his skill in metals. He was born at Glaucha, in Misnia, on the 24th of March 1494. The discoveries which he made in the mountains of Bohemia gave him so great a desire of examining accurately into every thing relating to metals, that though he had engaged in the practice of physic at Joachimstal by advice of his friends, he still prosecuted his study of fossils with great assiduity, and at length removed to Chemnitz, where he entirely devoted himself to this study. He spent in pursuit of it the pension he had from Maurice duke of Saxony, and part of his ow n estate; so that he reaped more reputation than profit from his labours. He wrote several pieces upon this and other subjects; and died at Chemnitz on the 21st of November 1555, a very firm Papist. In his younger years he seemed not averse to the Protestant doctrine; and he highly disapproved of the scandalous traffic of indulgences, and several other things in the church of Rome. In the latter part of his life, however, he attacked the Protestant religion, which rendered him so odious to the Lutherans, that they suffered his body to remain unburied for five days. It was then removed from Chemnitz to Zeitz, where it was interred in the principal church.

Agricola, John, a Saxon divine, born at Eisleben in 1492. He went as chaplain to Count Mansfeld, when that nobleman attended the elector of Saxony to the diet at Spire in 1526, and that of Augsburg in 1530. He was of a restless, ambitious temper, rivalled and wrote against Melanchthon, and gave Count Mansfeld occasion to reproach him severely. He obtained a professorship at Wittemberg, where he taught particular doctrines, and became founder of the sect of Antinomians; which occasioned warm disputes between him and Luther, who had before been his very good friend. But though he was never able to recover the favour either of the elector of Saxony or of Luther, he received some consolation from the fame he acquired at Berlin, where he became preacher at court; and was chosen, in 1548, in conjunction with Julius Phlug and Michael Heldingus, to compose the famous Interim, which made so much noise in the world. He died at Berlin in 1566.

Agriculture.

IT is our principal object in this article to lay before our readers a view of the present state of British agriculture, particularly as the art is practised in our best cultivated counties. Much of what we shall state is derived from our own experience and observation; but we shall nevertheless be careful, on all matters of importance, to refer to the most approved authorities.

It is sufficiently evident that the culture of the soil must have somewhat preceded, and always kept pace with, the increase of population. When we read of the large armies brought into the field in the early ages, and the great number of inhabitants which some of the ancient cities are said to have contained, we must necessarily conclude that the labours of agriculture were conducted with skill, and that its produce was abundant. A considerable population may, no doubt, subsist upon a rich soil, even in a very rude state of the art, drawing from it onlξ the supply of their own wants; but if much of the cultivator’s tune be required in the service of the public, and still more, if he has to provide for the subsistence and the luxury of large cities, he can obtain the necessary surplus produce only by successive improvements in his art. Not only his gross produce, but his net disposable produce, must be proportionally increased.

But of the rural economy even of the most civilized nations of antiquity, we are almost wholly ignorant. From the age of Moses, almost down to the commencement of the Christian era, though something may be gleaned from incidental notices in the Scriptures, and in the writings of a few ancient authors, we are quite unacquainted with the means by which food was obtained from the soil to support the rapid increase of mankind; especially when we find it accumulated on spots which seem to have been always naturally unproductive. We ought, perhaps, to except the Works and Days of Hesiod, who lived in the tenth century before our era, and who has described at some length the labours and the products of the agriculture of Greece at that early period. His work contains almost all the information we possess respecting the rural economy of that celebrated people.

Among the Romans this art seems to have obtained a high degree of improvement. It was practised by the rich and the great, and described by their poets and historians, several of whose works have reached our own times. These must be familiar to the classical scholar, and have been rendered accessible to all by Dickson, in his Husbandry of the Ancients, and other writers. We need therefore only mention the names ðf Cato, Varro, Virgil, Columella, Pliny, and Palladius, in the order in which they wrote. The treatises De Re Rustica of Varro and Columella are the most complete; but none of the Roman writers enables us to trace the rise and progress of agriculture, either in Italy or in any other country under their dominion. The most useful lesson they convey to the present age, perhaps, is the importance of attending to minute details, which their greatest names did not consider beneath their notice in the best period of their history.

From the fall of the Roman empire till the revival of learning in the fifteenth century, little is known of the state of agriculture in any part of Europe. The historians of the period were too much occupied in recording military achievements, and with the rude policy and intestine broils of their respective countries, to give much attention to the peaceful, and at that time degraded, labours of the husbandman. The policy of the feudal system, the distribution of society which it occasioned, and the perpetual dissensions and petty hostilities which it engendered, furnish the best evidence of the low state of an art which can flourish only under the protection of law, and be carried on with success only by the energy of free [7:2:252] men. But, during this long interval, the population of Europe was divided into two great classes, of which by far the larger one was composed of bondmen, without property, or the power of acquiring it, and small tenants, very little superior to bondmen; and the other class, consisting chiefly of the great barons and their retainers, was more frequently employed in laying waste the fields of their rivals, than in improving their own. The superstition of the times, which destined a large portion of the country to the support of the church, and which, in some measure, secured it from predatory incursions, was the principal source of what little skill and industry were then displayed in the cultivation of the soil. “If we consider the ancient state of Europe,” says Mr Hume,^[1. History of England, chap, xxiii.] “we shall find, that the far greater part of society were everywhere bereaved of their personal liberty, and lived entirely at the will of their masters. Every one that was not noble was a slave; the peasants were not in a better condition; even the gentry themselves were subjected to a long train of subordination under the greater barons, or chief vassals of the crown, who, though seemingly placed in a high state of splendour, yet, having but a slender protection from law, were exposed to every tempest of the state, and, by the precarious condition on which they lived, paid dearly for the power of oppressing and tyrannizing over their inferiors.”—“The villains were entirely occupied in the cultivation of their master’s land, and paid their rents either in corn or cattle, and other produce of the farm, or in servile offices, which they performed about the baron’s family, and upon farms which he retained in his own possession. In proportion as agriculture improved and money increased, it was found that these services, though extremely burdensome to the villain, were of little advantage to the master; and that the produce of a large estate could be much more conveniently disposed of by the peasants themselves, who raised it, than by the landlord or his bailiff, who were formerly accustomed to receive it A commutation was therefore made of rents for services, and of money-rents for those in kind; and as men in a subsequent age discovered that farms were better cultivated where the farmer enjoyed security in his possession, the practice of granting leases to the peasant began to prevail, which entirely broke the bonds of servitude, already much relaxed from the former practices. The latest laws which we find in England for enforcing or regulating this species of servitude were enacted in the reign of Henry VII. And though the ancient statutes on this subject remain still unrepealed by Parliament, it appears, that before the end of Elizabeth, the distinction between villain and freeman was totally, though insensibly, abolished; and that no person remained in the state to whom the former laws could be applied.”

But, long before the fifteenth century, it is certain that there was a class of tenants holding on leases for lives, or for a term of years, and paying a rent in land produce, in services, or in money. Whether they gradually sprung up from the class of bondmen, according to Lord Kames,^[2. Karnes’s Law Tracts.] or existed from the earliest period of the feudal constitution, according to other writers,^[3. Bell’s Treatise on Leases.] their number cannot be supposed to have been considerable during the middle ages. The stock which these tenants employed in cultivation commonly belonged to the proprietor, who received a proportion of the produce as rent; a system which still exists in France and in other parts of the Continent, where such tenants are called metayers, and some vestiges of which may yet be traced in the steel-bow of the law of Scotland. Leases of the thirteenth century still remain;^[4. Sir John Cullum’s History and Antiquities of Haτestcd (Suffolk.)] and both the laws and chartularies^[5. Chalmers’s Caledonia, book iv∙ c. G.] clearly prove the existence in Scotland of a class of cultivators distinct from the serfs or bondmen. Yet the condition of these tenants seems to have been very different from that of the tenants of the present day; and the lease approached nearer in its form to a feu charter than to the mutual agreement now in use. It was of the nature of a beneficiary grant by the proprietor, under certain conditions, and for a limited period: the cousent of the tenant seems never to have been doubted. In the common expression, “granting a lease,” we have retained an idea of the original character of the deed, even to the present time.

The corn crops cultivated during this period seem to have been of the same species, though all of them probably much inferior in quality to what they are in the present day. Wheat, the most valuable grain, must have borne a small proportion, at least in Britain, to that of other crops; the remarkable fluctuation of price, its extreme scarcity, indicated by the extravagant rate at which it was sometimes sold, as well as the preparatory cultivation required, may convince us that its consumption was confined to the higher orders, and that its growth was by no means extensive. Rye and oats furnished the bread and drink of the great body of the people of Europe. Cultivated herbage and roots were then unknown in the agriculture of Britain. It was not till the end of the reign of Henry VIII. that any sallads, carrots, or other edible roots were produced in England. The little of these vegetables that was used, was formerly imported from Holland and Flanders. Queen Catharine, when she wanted a sallad, was obliged to dispatch a messenger thither on purpose.^[6. Hume’s History of England, chap, xxiii.]

The ignorance and insecurity of those ages, which necessarily confined the cultivation of corn to a comparatively small portion of country, left all the rest of it in a state of nature, to be depastured by the inferior animals, then only occasionally subjected to the care and control of man. Cultivators were crowded together in miserable hamlets; the ground contiguous was kept continually under tillage; and beyond this, wastes and woodlands of a much greater extent were appropriated to the maintenance of their flocks and herds, which pastured indiscriminately, with little attention from their owners.

The low price of butcher-meat, though it was then the food of the common people, when compared with the price of corn, has been justly noticed by several writers as a decisive proof of the small progress of civilisation and industry.

According to the reports of a writer who has had access to the best sources of information, in addition to his own observations, the present state of the agriculture of the greater part of the Continent of Europe is not very different from what it was in Britain during the prevalence of the feudal system. “The greater part of France,” he says, “a still much greater portion of Germany, and nearly the whole of Prussia, Austria, Poland, and Russia, present a wretched uniformity of system. It is called the three-course husbandry, consisting of, Hi, one year’s clean fellow; 2cf, winter corn, chiefly rye, with a proportion of wheat commensurate to the manure that can be applied; 3(Z, summer corn, or barley and oats. There are occasional and small deviations from this system. In some few cases potatoes, in others peas, are grown, in the fallow year; [7:2:253] but they are only minute exceptions to the generally established system. It is not surprising that under such a system the produce should not be much more than four times the quantity of seed, at which rate it is calculated, as appears to be rightly, by Baron Alexander Humboldt.”

« The fields are almost universally uninclosed, and exposed to the most injurious effects of a changeable and an intemperate climate. The ancient feudal system of tenure is still continued, modified indeed, and softened in some few parts, but not to a degree or an extent that deserves to be taken into account in the view now under consideration of the countries as a whole. The peasants, for the most part, are adstricti glebae ; and where, by recent laws, their condition has been changed, the practical effect has yet hardly had time to exhibit'any observable improvement in their state. Labour, whether of men or of cattle, is usually exchanged for the occupancy of land; and hence the labour is performed in the most negligent and imperfect manner, that the vigilance of an overseer, who cannot be everywhere present, will allow.

“The lords of the soil, besides their demesnes, have the right of pasturage on the fields of their tenants from harvest to the next seed-time: hence none of those intervening crops which tend to enrich the soil can be cultivated without infringing on their rights.

“Among the cultivators of the land little or no accumulation of capital has been formed; from the lord to the lowest grade of the peasantry, all are alike destitute of disposable funds. The lords are only rich in land, and sufficiently at their ease, if that land be unencumbered with mortgages or annuities. The peasants, whether owners of the live stock and of the implements, or having the use of them with the land from its owners, are content to live on, from year to year, eating their own produce, growing their own wool and flax, and converting them into garments. They are quite satisfied if they can dispose of as much surplus produce as will pay the small share of money rent which becomes due to their lord.” (Tracts relating to the Corn Trade and Corn Laws, by William Jacob, Esq. 1828.)

It is certain, however, that an improved system has been introduced, and is extending itself, though slowly, in many parts of the countries which this writer has mentioned. Public establishments have been formed, which afford examples of correct management; and by these means knowledge is diffused among the principal land-owners in the first instance, and must ere long descend to the cultivator. Since the peace, many of the former class have visited other countries, and particularly Great Britain, with a view to the improvement of their estates. Some of them have held out encouragement to settlers from this country; others carried back our best implements, with farmbailiffs capable of instructing their people in the use of them, and of introducing our system of management generally; and not a few individuals of rank and influence in most parts of the Continent of Europe are now well acquainted with our agriculture, by their own personal observation. Prompted by interest, their active minds, no longer occupied in war, seem to enter eagerly upon this new field of employment. It is evident, indeed, from the great increase which has taken place of late in the population of these countries, as well as of our own, that a corresponding increase of produce must now be drawn from the soil. In all old peopled countries, the extension of tillage to fresh lands, without any improvement in the management, presents only a temporary and very limited resource.

At present, however, we have certainly little to learn from the agriculture of other countries; at least very little that can be beneficially introduced into our climate, which forbids any attempt at cultivating the fruits of the south of Europe. Even on a similar soil, and in the same latitude, the labours of the husbandman must be to a considerable extent directed and controlled by the local circumstances in which he is placed. This, perhaps, is the principal reason why the old system of successive crops of corn still prevails so generally throughout the Continent. The demand for butcher-meat, for instance, may not be such as to afford a suitable return for the extended culture of turnips and other ameliorating crops, which are found so beneficial in this country.

We should except from this remark much of the Netherlands, and probably a part of Italy. Flanders has long been celebrated for its agriculture; and tlíe care and success with which its labours are conducted seem not unworthy the attention of our best cultivators. The culture of the Vale of Arno, in Italy, also presents an interesting object, and has been warmly eulogized by Chateauvieux and other travellers. But instead of going into details here, we shall notice, under the heads to which they belong, the practices that appear to us of most importance in the agriculture of other countries, when we come to describe our own.

Before entering upon this our main object, it may not be without its interest to present a concise view of the progress of our agriculture to its present state, from the rude condition in which, in common with that of the rest of Europe, it was found at the time when we first have authorities to refer to on the subject. Such a view must necessarily include notices of the principal laws affecting it, as well as of our early writers, whose works are very little known; and it may serve to convey some idea of the successive changes that have occurred in the condition of the great body of our people.

The subject of this article will thus be considered under two divisions. In the first, we shall treat of the history of British agriculture; and in the second, of its present state; describing under the latter the crops, culture, and general management adapted to different soils, agreeably to the practice of our best cultivators.

Part I.

History of British Agriculture.

Of the early agriculture of England, and of the condition of its cultivators, we may form some conception by adverting to a few of the enactments, from the Conquest down to the beginning of the reign of Henry VII. in 1485, when the feudal system, which had been gradually falling into decay, was almost dissolved in that country.

One of the earliest and greatest grievances was the levying of Purveyance. This originally comprehended the necessary provisions, carriages, &c. which the nearest farmers were obliged to furnish to the king’s armies at the current prices, and to his houses and castles in time of war. It was called the great purveyance, and the officers who collected those necessaries were called purveyors. The smaller purveyance included the necessary provisions and carriages for the king’s household, when living at home, or travelling through the kingdom, which the tenants on the king’s demesne lands were obliged to furnish gratis; and the practice came to be adopted by the barons and great men, in every tour which they thought proper to make in the country. These exactions were so grievous, and levied in so licentious a manner, that the farmers, when they heard of the court’s approach, often deserted their houses, as if the country had been invaded [7:2:254] by an enemy. “Purveyance,” says Dirom,^[7. Inquiry into the Corn Laics, &c. p. 9.] “was perhaps for many centuries the chief obstruction to the agriculture and improvement of Great Britain. Many laws were made for the reformation and regulation of purveyance, but without effect; and the practice continued down to so late a period as the reign of James the First.”

The home trade in corn was restrained by acts against forestallers in 1360, and at several subsequent periods. For many years after the Conquest, the greater part of the trade of England was carried on in markets and fairs; and a very considerable part of the revenue of the crown arose from the duties payable to the king, upon the goods brought to them for sale. The barons had also tolls at the fairs within their respective jurisdictions. When farmers and merchants were bringing their corn and other necessaries to be sold there, they were sometimes met on the way by persons who purchased their commodities, in order to retail them at a higher price. Thus the king and the lords of the manor lost the several duties payable to them; and the price, it was thought, was at the same time raised to the inhabitants. Such were the original forestallcrs, who were subjected by several statutes to severe penalties. This crime of forestalling, and the kindred ones of regrating and engrossing, were carefully defined, and the different degrees of punishment specified, in a new statuto in 1552, to be afterwards noticed. An early law of 1266, for regulating the assize of bread and ale, furnishes a clear proof of the little intercourse that must have subsisted at that time between town and country. “Brewers in cities,” says the statute, “may well afford to sell two gallons of beer or ale for a penny, and out of cities three or four gallons for a penny.”

Several laws were made in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, permitting the exportation of grain when the price of wheat did not exceed six shillings and eightpence a quarter; and in 1463 importation was prohibited when the price was lower. The last statute, however, was little attended to, and foreign grain was admitted as before; while the state of the country, and the restrictions on internal commerce, scarcely permitted any advantage to be derived from the acts allowing exportation.

In Mr Chalmers’s Caledonia, a great many valuable notices are collected regarding the husbandry of Scotland during these ages. It is evident from his elaborate researches, that the progress of cultivation in the 13th century had been greater than we should have expected from the turbulence of the times, and the comparatively rude and uncivilized state of society. Purveyance, and other obstructions to improvement, were nearly the same in Scotland as in England; the laws regarding the corn trade appear, in some instances, to have been copied from those of England; and in the northern, as in the southern part of the island, the clergy were by far the most skilful and industrious husbandmen.

Yet it is difficult to reconcile the idea of any considerable improvement, particularly in so far as regards the extensive cultivation of wheat (which Mr Chalmers infers from the authorities he quotes), with an act passed in 1426, which ordained every husbandman tilling with a plough of eight oxen to sow at least a firlot (little more than a Winchester bushel) of wheat, and half a firlot of peas, with a proportion of beans; or with the state of the districts only a few years ago, where wheat is said to have been extensively grown at that early period.

By statute 1449, the tenant was for the first time secured in possession, during the term of his lease, against a purchaser of the land; and in 1469 he was protected from having his property carried oft’ for the landlord’s debts, beyond the amount of rent actually due; an enactment which proves his miserable condition before that time.

Soon after the beginning of the 16th century, agriculture partook of the general improvement which followed the invention of printing, the revival of learning, and the more settled authority of government; and instead of the occasional notices of historians, we can now refer to regular treatises, written by men who engaged eagerly in this neglected and hitherto degraded occupation. We shall therefore give a short account of the principal works, as well as of the laws and general policy of Britain, in regard to agriculture, from the early part of the sixteenth century to the Revolution in 1688, when a new era commenced in the legislation of corn, and soon after in the practice of the cultivator.

The first and by far the best of our early works is the Book of Husbandry, printed in 1534, commonly ascribed to Fitzherbert, a judge of the common pleas in the reign of Henry VIII. This was followed, in 1539, by the Book of Surveying and Improvements, by the same author. In the former treatise we have a clear and minute description of the rural practices of that period, and from the latter may be learned a good deal of the economy of the feudal system in its decline. The Book of Husbandry has scarcely been excelled by any later production, in as far as concerns the subjects of which it treats; for at that time cultivated herbage and edible roots were still unknown in England. The author writes from his own experience of more than forty years; and, with the exception of passages denoting his belief in the superstition of the Roman writers, there is very little of this valuable work that should be omitted, and not a great deal that need be added, in so far as regards the culture of corn, in a manual of husbandry adapted even to the present time. Fitzherbert touches on almost every department of the art, and in about a hundred octavo pages has contrived to condense more practical information than will be found scattered through as many volumes of later times; and yet he is minute even to the extreme on points of real utility. There is no reason to say, with Mr Harte, that he had revived the husbandry of the Romans; he merely describes the practices of the age in which he lived; and from his commentary on the old statute extenta ma∙ nerii, in his Book of Surveying, in which he does not allude to any recent improvements, it is probable that the management which he details had been long established. But it may surprise some of the agriculturists of the present day to be told, that, after the lapse of almost three centuries, Fitzherbert’s practice, in some nfaterial branches, has not been improved upon; and that in several districts abuses still exist, which were as clearly pointed out by him at that early period as by any writer of the present age.

The Book of Husbandry begins with the plough and other instruments, which are concisely and yet minutely described; and then about a third part of it is occupied with the several operations as they succeed one another throughout the year. Among other things in this part of the work, the following deserve notice :—“Somme (ploughs) wyll tourn the sheld bredith at every landsende, and plowe all one way ;” the same kind of plough that is now found so useful on hilly grounds. Of wheel-ploughs he observes, that “they be good on even grounde that lyeth [7:2:255] lyghte and on such lands they are still most commonly employed. Cart-wheels were sometimes bound with iron, of which he greatly approves. On the much agitated question about the employment of horses or oxen in labour, the most important arguments are distinctly stated. u In somme places,” he says, “a horse plough is better,” and in others an oxen plough, to which, upon the whole, he gives the preference; and to this, considering the practices of that period, they were probably entitled. Beans and peas seem to have been common crops. He mentions the different kinds of wheat, barley, and oats; and after describing the method of harrowing “all maner of comnes,” we find the roller employed. “They use to role their barley grounde after a showr of rayne, to make the grounde even to mowe.” Under the article “To falowe,” he observes, “the greater clottes (clods) the better wheate, for the clottes kepe the wheat warme all wynter; and at March they will melte and breake and fal in manye small peces, the whiche is a newe dongynge and refreshynge of the come.” This is agreeable to the present practice, founded on the very same reasons. “In May, the shepe folde is to be set out;” but Fitzherbert does not much approve of folding, and points out its disadvantages in a very judicious manner. “In thè later end of May and the begynnynge of June, is tyme to wede the corne and then we have an accurate description of the different weeds, and the instruments and mode of weeding. Next comes a second ploughing of the fallow; and afterwards, in the latter end of June, the mowing of the meadows begins. Of this operation, and of the forks and rakes, and the haymaking, there is a very good account. The com harvest naturally follows: rye and wheat were usually shorn, and barley and oats cut with the scythe. This intelligent writer does not approve of the practice, which still prevails in some places, of cutting wheat high, and then mowing the stubbles. “In Somersetshire,” he says, “they do shere theyr wheat very lowe; and the wheate strawe that they purpose to make tlιacke of, they do not threshe it, but cut off the ears, and bynd it in sheves, and call it rede, and therewith they thacke theyr houses.” He recommends the practice of setting up corn in shocks, with two sheaves to cover eight, instead of ten sheaves, as at present; probably owing to the straw being then shorter. The corn was commonly housed; but if there be a want of room, he advises that the ricks be built on a scaffold, and not upon the ground. Com-stacks are now beginning to be built on pillars and frames. The fallow received a third ploughing in September, and was sown about Michaelmas. “Wheat is moost commonlye sowne under the forowe, that is to say, cast it uppon the falowe, and then plowe it under and this branch of his subject is concluded with directions about threshing, winnowing, and other kinds of barn-work.

Fitzherbert next proceeds to live stock. “An hous-bande,” he says, “can not well thryue by his corne without he have other cattell, nor by his cattell without corne. And bycause that shepe, in myne opynyon, is the mooste profytablest cattell that any man can haue, therefore I pourpose to speake fyrst of shepe.” His remarks on this subject are so accurate, that one might imagine they came from a storemaster of the present day; and the minutiae which he details are exactly what the writer of this article has seen practised in the hilly parts of this country. In some places at present, “they neuer seuer their lambcs from their dammes ;” “and the poore of the peeke (high) eountreye, and such other places, where, as they vsc to milke theyr ewes, they vse to wayne theyr lambes at 12 weekes okle, and to mylke their ewes fiue or syxe weekes but that, he observes, “is greate hurte to the ewes, and wyll cause them that they wyll not take the ramme at the tyme of the yere for pouertye, but goo barreyne.” “In June is tyme to shere shepe; and ere they be shorne, they must be verye well washen, the which shall be to the owner greate profyte in the sale of his wool, and also to the clothe-maker.” It appears that hand washing was then a common practice ;' and yet in the west and north of Scotland, at this day, sheep are never washed at all. His remarks on horses, cattle, &c. are not less interesting; and there is a very good account of the diseases of each species, and some just observations on the advantage of mixing different kinds on the same pasture. Swine and bees conclude this branch of the work.

The author then points out the great advantages of inclosures; recommends “quycksettynge, dychynge, and hedgeyng ;” and gives particular directions about the settes, and the method of training a hedge, as well as concerning the planting and management of trees. We have then a short information “for a yonge gentylman that intendeth to thryue,” and “a prolonge for the wiues occupation,” in some instances rather too homely for the present time. Among other things, she is to “make her husband and herself somme clothes ;” and “she maye haue the lockes of the shepe eyther to make blankettes and courlettes, or bothe.” This is not so much amiss; but what follows will bring our learned judge into disrepute even with our most industrious housewives. “It is a wyues occupation,” he says, “to wynowe all maner of cornes, to make malte, to washe and wrynge, to make heye, shere corne, and, in time of nede, to lιelpe her husbande to fyll the mucke wayne or dounge carte, dryue the ploughe, to loode heye, corne, and suche other; and to go or ride to the market to sei butter, chese, mylke, egges, chekyns, capons, hennes, pygges, gese, and all maner of cornes.” The rest of the book contains some useful advices about diligence and economy; and concludes, after the manner of the age, with many pious exhortations.

Such is Fitzherbert ’ s Book of Husbandry, and such was the state of agriculture in England in the early part of the sixteenth century, and probably for a long time before; for he nowhere speaks of the practices which he describes or recommends as of recent introduction.

The Book of Surveying adds considerably to our knowledge of the rural economy of that age. “Four maner of commens” are described; several kinds of mills for com and other purposes, and also “quernes that goo with hand ;” different orders of tenants, down to the “boundmen,” who “in some places contynue as yet ;” “and many tymes, by colour thereof, there be many freemen taken as boundmen, and their lands and goods is taken from them.” Lime and marl are mentioned as common manures; and the former was sometimes spread on the surface to destroy heath. Both draining and irrigation are noticed, though the latter but slightly. And the work concludes with an inquiry “how to make a township that is worth XX. marke a yere, worth XX. li. a year from which we shall give a specimen of the author’s manner, as well as of the economy of the age.

“It is undoubted, that to every townshyppe that stand-eth in tyllage in the playne countrey, there be errable landes to plowe and sowe, and leyse to tye or tedder theyr horses and mares upon, and common pasture to kepe and pasture their catell, beestes, and shepe upon; and also they have medowe grounde to get theyr hey upon. Than to let it be known how many acres of errable lande euery man hath in tyllage, and of the same acres in euery felde to chaunge with his neyghbours, and to leye them toguy-ther, and to make hym one seuerall close in euery felde for his errable lands; and his leyse in euery felde to leye [7:2:256] them togyther in one felde, and to make one seuerall close for them all. And also another seuerall close for his portion of his common pasture, and also his porcion of his medowe in a seuerall close by itselfe, and al kept in seue-ral both in wynter and somer; and euery cottage shall haue his portion assigned hym accordynge to his ’ rent, and than shall Ιιat the ryche man ouerpresse the poore man with his cattell; and euery man may eate his oun close at his pleasure. And vndoubted, that hay and strawe that will find one beest in the house wyll finde two beestes in the close, and better they shall lyke. For those beestis in the house have short heare and thynne, and towards March they will pylle and be bare; and therefore they may nat abyde in the fylde before the heerdmen in winter tyme for colde. And those that lye in a close under a hedge haue longe heare and thyck, and they will neuer pylle nor be bare; and by this reason the husbande maye kepe twyse so many catell as he did before.

“This is the cause of this approwment. Nowe euery husbande hath sixe seuerall closes, whereof iii. be for corne, the fourthe for his leyse, the fyfte for his commen pastures, and the sixte for his haye; and in wynter time there is but one occupied with corne, and than hath the husbande other fyue to occupy tyll lente come, and that he hath his falowe felde, his ley felde, and his pasture felde al sommer. And when he hath mowen his medowe, than he hath his medowe grounde, soo that if he hath any weyke catell that wold be amended, or dyvers maner of catell, he may put them in any close he wyll, the which is a great advantage; and if all shulde lye commen, than wolde the edyche of the corne feldes and the aftermatlι of all the medowes be eaten in X. or XII. dayes. And the rych men that hath moche catell wold have the advantage,' and the poore man can have no helpe nor relefe in wynter when he hath moste nede; and if an acre of lande be worthe sixe pens, or it be enclosed, it will be worth VIII. pens whan it is enclosed, by reason of the compostying and dongyng of the catell that shall go and lye upon it both day and nighte; and if any of his thre closes that he hath for his corne be worne or ware bare, than he may breke and plowé up his close that he hadde for his layse, or the close that he hadde for his commen pasture, or bothe, and sowe them with corne, and let the other lye for a time, and so shall he have aìway reist grounde, the which will bear moche corne with lytel donge; and also he shall have a great profyte of the wod in the hedges whan it is growen; and not only these profytes and advantages beforesaid, but he shall save moche more than al these, for by reason of these closes he shall save meate, drinke, and wages of a shepeherde, the wages of the heerdman, and the wages of the swine herde, the which may fortune to be as chargeable as all his holle rent; and also his come shall be better saved from eatinge or destroyeng with catel. For dout ye nat but heerdemen with their catell, shepeherdes with their shepe, and tieng of horses and mares, destroyed! moch corne, the which the hedges wold save. Par-aduenture some men would say, that this shuld be against the common weale, bicause the shepeherdes, heerdmen, and swyneherdes, shuld than be put out of wages. To that it may be answered, though these occupations be not used, there be as many newe occupations that were not used before; as getting of quickesettes, diching, hedging, and plashing, the which the same men may use and oc-cupye.”

The next author who writes professedly on agriculture is Tusser, whose Five Hundred Points of Husbandry, published in 1562, was formerly in such high repute as to be recommended by Lord Molesworth to be taught in schools.^[8. Some Considerations for the promoting of Agriculture and employing the Poor. Dublin, 1723.] The edition of 1604 is die one we make use of here, in which the book of husbandry consists of 118 pages; and then follows the Points of Housewifrie, occupying 42 pages more. It is written in verse. Amidst a vast heap of rubbish, there are some useful notices concerning the state of agriculture at the time in different parts of England. Hops, which had been introduced in the early part of the sixteenth century, and on the culture of which a treatise was published in 1574 by Reynolde Scott, are mentioned as a well-known crop. Buckwheat was sown after barley. It seems to have been the practice then, in some places, to “geld fillies” as well as colts. Hemp and flax are mentioned as common crops. Inclosures must have been numerous in several counties; and there is a very good comparison between “champion (open fields) country, and several,” which Blythe afterwards transcribed into his Improver Improved. Carrots, cabbages, turnips, and rape, are mentioned among the herbs and roots for the kitchen. There is nothing to be found in Tusser about serfs or bondmen, as in Fitzherbert’s works. This author’s division of the crop is rather curious, though probably quite inaccurate, if he means that the whole rent might be paid by a tenth of the com.

“One part cast forth for rent due out of hand.

“One other part for seed to sow thy land.

“Another part leave parson for his tith.

“Another part for harvest, sickle and sith.

“One part for ploughwrite, cartwrite, knacker, and smith.

“One part to uphold thy teemes that draw therewith. “Another part for servant and workman’s wages laie. “One part likewise for filbellie daie by daie.

“One part thy wife for needful things doth crave.

“Thyself and thy child the last part would have.”

The next writer is Barnaby Googe, whose IF⅞ofe Art of Husbandry was printed in 1578, and again by Markham in 1614. The first edition is merely a translation of a German work'; and very little is said of English husbandry in the second, though Markham made some trifling interpolations, in order, as it is alleged, to adapt the German husbandry to the English climate. It is for the most part made up of gleanings from the ancient writers of Greece and Rome, whose errors are faithfully retained, with here and there some description of the practices of the age, in which there is little of novelty or importance. Googe mentions a number of English writers who lived about the time of Fitzherbert, whose works have not been preserved.

For more than fifty years after this, or till near the middle of the seventeenth century, there are no systematic works on husbandry, though several treatises on particular departments of it. From these it is evident, that all the different operations of the farmer were performed with more care and correctness than formerly; that the fallows were better worked, the fields kept freer of weeds, and much more attention paid to manures of every kind. A few of the writers of this period deserve to be shortly noticed.

Sir Hugh Plat, in his Jewel House of Art and Nature, printed in 1594 (which Weston in his catalogue erroneously gives to Gabriel Plattes), makes some useful observations on manures, but chiefly collected from other writers. His censure of the practice of leaving farm dung lying scattered about is among the most valuable.
[7:2:257]

Sir John Norden’s Surveyor's Dialogue, printed in 1607, and reprinted with additions in 1618, is a work of considerable merit. The first three books of it relate to the rights of the lord of the manor, and the various tenures by which landed property was then held, with the obligations which they imposed. Among others, we find the singular custom so humorously described in the Spectator, of the incontinent widow riding upon a ram. In the fifth book there are a good many judicious observations on the “different natures of grounds, how they may be employed, how they may be bettered, reformed, and amended.” The famous meadows near Salisbury are mentioned; and when cattle have fed their fill, hogs, it is pretended, “are made fat with the remnant; namely, with the knots and sappe of the grasse.” “Clouer grasse, or the grasse honey suckle” (white clover), is directed to be sown with other hay seeds. “Carrot rootes” were then raised in several parts of England, and sometimes by farmers. London street and stable dung was carried to a distance by water, though it appears from later writers to have been got for the trouble of removing. And leases of 21 years are recommended for persons of small capital, as better than employing it in purchasing land; an opinion that prevails very generally among our present farmers.

Bees seem to have been great favourites with these early writers; and among others, there is a treatise by Butler, a gentleman of Oxford, called the Feminine Monarchie, or the History of Bees, printed in 1609, full of all manner of quaintness and pedantry.

We shall pass over Markham, Mascall, Gabriel Plattes, and several other authors of this period, the best part of their writings being preserved by Blythe and Hartlib, of whom we shall say a little immediately. In Sir Richard Weston’s Discourse on the Husbandry of Brabant and Flanders, published by Hartlib in 1645, we may mark the dawn of the vast improvements which have since been effected in Britain. This gentleman was ambassador from England to the elector palatine and king of Bohemia in 1619, and had the merit of being the first who introduced the great clover, as it was then called, into English agriculture, about 1645, and probably turnips also. His directions for the cultivation of clover are better than was to be expected. It thrives best, he says, when you sow it on the worst and barrcnest ground, such as our worst heath ground is in England. The ground is to be pared and burnt, and unslaeked lime must be added to the ashes. It is next to be well ploughed and harrowed; and about ten pounds of clover seed must be sown on an acre in April or the end of March. If you intend to preserve seed, then the second crop must be let stand till it come to a full and dead ripeness; and you shall have at the least five bushels per acre. Being once sown, it will last five years; and then being ploughed, it will yield, three or four years together, rich crops of wheat, and after that a crop of oats, with which elover seed is to be sown again. It is in itself an excellent manure, Sir Richard adds; and so it should be, to enable land to bear this treatment. In less than ten years after its introduction, that is, before 1655, the culture of clover, exactly according to the present method, seems to have been well known in England, and it had also made its way to Ireland.

A great many works on agriculture appeared during the time of the commonwealth, of which Blythe’s Improver Improved, and Hartlib’s Legacy, are the most valuable. The first edition of the former was published in 1649, and of the latter in 1650; and both of them were enlarged in subsequent editions. In the first edition of the Improver Improved, no mention is made of clover, nor in the second of turnips; but in the third, published in 1662, clover is treated of at some length, and turnips are recommended as an excellent cattle crop, the culture of which should be extended from the kitchen garden to the field. Sir Richard Weston must have cultivated turnips before this; for Blythe says, that Sir Richard affirmed to himself he did feed his swine with them. They were first given boiled, but afterwards the swine came to eat them raw, and would run after the carts, and pull them forth as they gathered them; an expression which conveys an idea of their being cultivated in the fields.

Blythe’s book is the first systematic work in which there are some traces of the alternate husbandry so beneficially established since, by interposing clover and turnip between culmiferous crops. He is a great enemy to commons and common fields, and to retaining land in old pasture, unless it be of the best quality. His description of the different kinds of ploughs is interesting; and he justly recommends such as were drawn by two horses (some even by one horse), in preference to the weighty and clumsy machines which required four or more horses or oxen. Almost all the manures now used seem to have been then well known; and he brought lime himself from a distance of 20 miles. He speaks of an instrument which ploughed, sowed, and harrowed at the same time; and the setting of corn was then a subject of much discussion. “It was not many years,” says Blythe, “since the famous city of London petitioned the parliament of England against two anusancies or offensive commodities, which were likely to come into great use and esteem; and that was Newcastle coal, in regard of their stench, &c., and hops, in regard they would spoyle the taste of drink, and endanger the people.”

Hartlib’s Legacy is a very heterogeneous performance, containing, among some very judicious directions, a great deal of rash speculation. Several of the deficiencies which the writer complains of in English agriculture must be placed to the account of our climate, and never have been or can be supplied. Some of his recommendations are quite unsuitable to the state of the country, and display more of general knowledge and good intention, than of either the theory or practice of agriculture. Among the subjects deserving notice may be mentioned the practice of steeping and liming seed corn as a preventive of smut; changing every year the species of grain, and bringing seed corn from a distance; ploughing down green crops as manure; and feeding horses with broken oats and chaff. This writer seems to differ a good deal from Blythe about the advantage of interchanging tillage and pasture. “It were no losse to this island,” he says, “if that we should not plough at all, if so be that we could certainly have corn at a reasonable rate, and likewise vent for all our manufactures of wool and one reason for this is, that pasture employeth more hands than tillage, instead of depopulating the country, as was commonly imagined. The grout, which he mentions “as coming over to us in Holland ships,” about which he desires information, was probably the same with our present shelled barley; and mills for manufacturing it were introduced into Scotland from Holland towards the beginning of the last century.

To the third edition, published in 1655, are subjoined Dr Beatie’s Annotations, with the writer of the Legacy’s answers, both of them ingenious, and sometimes instructive. But this cannot be said of Gabriel Plattes’s Mercurius Laetificans, also added to this edition, which is a most extravagant production. There are also several communications from Hartlib’s different correspondents, of which the most interesting are those on the early cultivation and great value of clover. Hartlib himself does not appear much in this collection; but he seems to have been a [7:2:258] very useful person in editing the works of others, and as a collector of miscellaneous information on rural subjects. It is strange that neither Blythe nor Hartlib, nor any of Hartlib’s correspondents, seem ever to have heard of Fitzherbert’s works.

Among the other writers previous to the Revolution, we shall only mention Ray the botanist and Evelyn, both men of great talents and research, whose works are still in high estimation. A new edition of Evelyn’s Silva and Terra was published in 1777 by Dr Hunter, with large notes and elegant engravings, and reprinted in 1812.

The preceding review commences with a period of feudal anarchy and despotism, and comes down to the time when the exertions of individual interest were protected and encouraged by the firm administration of equal laws; when the prosperity of Great Britain was no longer retarded by internal commotions, nor endangered by hostile invasion.

The laws of this period, in so far as they relate to agriculture and rural economy, display a similar progress in improvement.

From the beginning of the reign of Henry VII. to the end of Elizabeth’s, a number of statutes were made for the encouragement of tillage, though probably to little purpose. The great grievance of those days was the practice of laying arable land to pasture, and suffering the farm-houses to fall to ruin. “Where in some towns,” says the statute 4th Henry VII. (1488), “two hundred persons were occupied and lived of their lawful labours, now there arc occupied two or three herdsmen, and the residue fall into idleness therefore it is ordained, that houses which within three years have been let for farms, with twenty aeres of land lying in tillage or husbandry, shall be upheld, under the penalty of half the profits, to be forfeited to the king or the lord of the fee. Almost half a century afterwards, the practice had become still more alarming; and in 1534 a new aetwas tried, apparently with as little success. “. Some have 24,000 sheep, some 20,000 sheep, some 10,000, some 6000, some 4000, and some more and some less and yet it is alleged the price of wool had nearly doubled, “sheep being come to a few persons’ hands.” A penalty was therefore imposed on all who kept above 2000 sheep; and no person was to take in farm more than two tenements of husbandry. By the 39th Elizabeth (1597), arable land made pasture since the 1st Elizabeth shall be again converted into tillage, and what is arable shall not be converted into pasture.

Many laws were enacted during this period against vagabonds, as they were called; and persons who could not find employment seem to have been sometimes confounded with those who really preferred idleness and plunder. The dissolution of the feudal system, and the suppression of the monasteries, deprived a great part of the rural population of the means of support. They could not be employed in cultivating the soil, for there was no middle class of farmers possessed of capital to be vested in improvements; and what little disposable capital was in the hands of great proprietors eould not, in those rude times, be so advantageously embarked in the expensive and precarious labours of growing eom, as in pasturage, whieh required much less skill and superintendence. Besides, there was a constant demand for wool on the Continent; while the corn-market was not only confined by laws against exportation, but fettered by restrictions on the internal trade. The laws regarding the wages of labour and the price of provisions are a further proof of the ignorance of the age in regard to the proper subject of legislation.

By the statute 1552 it is declared, that any person that shall buy merchandise, victual, &c. coming to market, or make any bargain for buying the same before they shall be in the market ready to be sold, or shall make any motion for enhancing the priee, or dissuade any person from eoming to market, or forbear to bring any of the things to market, &e. shall be deemed a forestaller. Any person who buys and sells again in the same market, or within four miles thereof, shall be reputed a regrater. Any person buying eorn growing in the fields, or any other corn, with intent to sell again, shall be reputed an unlawful ingrosser. It was also declared, that no person shall sell cattle within five weeks after he had bought them. Licences, indeed, were to be granted in certain cases, and particularly when the price of wheat was at or under 6s. 8d. a quarter, and other kinds of grain in that proportion.

The laws regarding the exportation and importation of corn during this period eould have had little effect in encouraging agriculture, though towards the latter part of it they gradually approached that system which was finally established at and soon after the Revolution. From the time of the above-mentioned statute against forestalled, which effectually prevented exportation, as well as the freedom of the home trade, when corn was above the priee therein specified, down to 1688, there are at least twelve statutes on this subject; and some of them are so nearly the same, that it is probable they were not very carefully observed. The priee at which wheat was allowed to be exported was raised from 6s. 8d. a quarter, the price fixed by the 1st and 2d of Philip and Mary (1553), to 10s. in 1562; to 20s. in 1593; to 26s. 8d. in 1604; to 32s. in 1623; to 40s. in 1660 ∙ to 48s. in 1663; and at last, in 1670, exportation was virtually permitted without limitation. Certain duties, however, were payable, which in some cases seem to have amounted to a prohibition; and until 1660 importation was not restrained even in years of plenty and cheapness. In permitting exportation, the object appears to have been revenue rather than the encouragement of production.

The first statute for levying tolls at turnpikes, to make or repair roads in England, passed in 1662.

Of the state of agriculture in Scotland in the 16th and the greater part of the 17th eentury, very little is known; no professed treatise on the subject appeared till after the Revolution. The south-eastern counties were the earliest improved, and yet in 1660 their condition seems to have been very wretehed. Ray, who made a tour along the eastern coast in that year, says, ii we observed little or no fallow grounds in Scotland; some ley groundwe saw, which they manured with sea wreck. The men seemed to be very lazy, and may be frequently observed to plough in their cloaks. It is the fashion of them to wear cloaks when they go abroad, but especially on. Sundays. They have neither good bread, cheese, nor drink. They cannot make them, nor will they learn. Their butter is very indifferent, and one would wonder how they could contrive to make it so bad. They use much pottage made of coalwort, whieh they call kail, sometimes broth of decorticated barley. The ordinary country-houses are pitiful cots, built of stone and covered with turfs, having in them but one room, many of them no chimneys, the windows very small holes, and not glazed. The ground in the valleys and plains bears very good corn, but especially bears barley or bigge, and oats, but rarely wheat and rye.”^[9. Select Remains of John Ray. Lon<l. 17 GO.]
[7:2:259]

It is probable that no great change had taken place in Scotland from the end of the 15th century, except that tenants gradually became possessed of a little stock of their own, instead of having their farm stocked by the landlord. “The minority of James V., the reign of Mary Stuart, the infancy of her son, and the civil wars of her grandson Charles L, were all periods of lasting waste. The very laws which were made during successive reigns, for protecting the tillers of the soil from spoil, are the best proofs of the deplorable state of the husbandman.”^[10. Chalmers’s Caledonia, vol. ii. p. 732.]

Yet in the 17th century were those laws made which paved the way for the present improved system of agriculture in Scotland; By statute 1633, landholders were enabled to have their tithes valued, and to buy them either at nine or six years’ purchase, according to the nature of the property. The statute 1685, conferring on landlords a power to entail their estates, was indeed of a very different tendency in regard to its effects on agriculture. But the two acts in 1695, for the division of commons, and separation of intermixed properties, have facilitated in an eminent degree the progress of improvement.

' From the Revolution to the accession of George III. the 'progress of agriculture was by no means so considerable as we should be led to imagine from the great exportation of com. It is the opinion of well-informed writers,^[11. Annals of Agriculture, No. 270. Harte’s Essays. Comber on National Subsistence, p. 1G1.] that very little improvement had taken place, either in the cultivation of the soil or in the management of live stock, from the Restoration down to the middle of last century. Even clover and turnips, the great support of the present improved system of agriculture, were confined to a few districts, and at the latter period were scarcely cultivated at all by common farmers in the northern part of the island. Of the writers of this - period, therefore, we shall notice only such as describe some improvement in the modes of culture, or some extension of the practices that were formerly little known.

In Houghton’s Collections on Husbandry and Trade, a periodical work begun in 1681, we have the first notice of turnips being eaten by sheep. “Some in Essex have their fallow after turnips, which feed their sheep in winter, by which means the turnips are scooped, and so made capable to hold dews and rain water, which, by corrupting, imbibes the nitre of the air, and when the shell breaks it runs about and fertilizes. By feeding the sheep, the land is dunged as if it had been folded; and those turnips, though few or none be carried off for human use, are a very excellent improvement, nay, some reckon it so though they only plough the turnips in without feeding.”^[12. Houghton’s_CoZfccíwnj on Husbandry and Trade, vol. i. p. 213. edit. 1728.] This was written in February 1694; but ten years before, Wor-lidge, one of his correspondents, observes, “sheep fatten very well on turnips, λvhich prove an excellent nourishment forthem in hard winters, when fodder is scarce; for they will not only eat the greens, but feed on the roots in the ground, and scoop them hollow even to the very skin. Ten acres (he adds) sown with clover, turnips, &c. will feed as many sheep as one hundred acres thereof would before have done.”^[13. Ibid. vol. iv∙ p. 142-144.]

At this time potatoes were beginning to attract notice. “The potato,” says Houghton, “is a bacciferous herb, with esculent roots, bearing winged leaves and a bell flower..

“This, I have been informed, was brought first out of Virginia by Sir Walter Raleigh; and he stopping at Ire-

F . f ∙

land, some was planted there, where it thrived very well, and to good purpose; for in their succeeding wars, when all the corn above the ground was destroyed, this supported them; for the soldiers, unless they had dug up all the ground where they grew, and almost sifted it, could not extirpate them; from whence they were brought to Lancashire, where they are very numerous, and now they begin to spread all the kingdom over. They are a pleasant food boiled or roasted, and eaten with butter and sugar. There is a sort brought from Spain, that are of a longer form, and are more luscious than ours; they are much set by, and sold for sixpence or eightpence the pound.”^[14. Ibid. vol. ii. p. 468.]

The next writer is Mortimer, whose Whole Art of Husbandry was published in 1706, and has since run through several editions. It is a regular, systematic work, of considerable merit; and it does not appear that much improvement has beèn made since in the practices he describes, in many parts of Britain. From the third edition of Hartlib’s Legacy, we learn that clover was cut green, and given to cattle; and it appears that this practice of soiling, as it is now called, had become very common about the beginning of last century, wherever clover was cultivated. Ryegrass was now sown along with it. Turnips were hand-hoed, and extensively employed in feeding sheep and cattle, in the same manner as at present.

The first considerable improvement in the practice of that period was introduced by Jethro Tull, a gentleman of Berkshire, who began to drill wheat and other crops about the year 1701, and whose Horse-hoeing Husbandry was published in 1731. In giving a short account of the innovations of this eccentric writer, it is not meant to enter into any discussion of their merits. It will not detract much from his reputation to admit that, like most other men who leave the beaten path, he was sometimes misled by inexperience, and sometimes deceived by a too sanguine imagination. Had Tull confined his recommendation of the drill husbandry to leguminous and bulbous-rooted plants generally, and to the cereal gramina only in particular circumstances; and had he, without puzzling himself about the food of plants, been contented with pointing out the great advantage of pulverizing the soil in most cases, and extirpating weeds in every case, he would certainly have deserved a high rank among the benefactors of his country. A knowledge of his doctrines and practice, however, will serve as a necessary introduction to the present approved modes of culture.

Tull’s theory is promulgated with great confidence; and in the controversy which he thought proper to maintain in support of it, he scrupled not to employ ridicule as well as reasoning. Besides the Roman writers De Re Rustica, Virgil in particular, whom he treats with high disdain, he is almost equally severe on Woodward, Bradley, and other writers of his own time.

As the distance between his rows appeared much greater than was necessary for the range of the roots of the plants, Tull begins by showing that these roots extend much farther than is commonly believed, and then proceeds to inquire into the nature of their food. After examining several hypotheses, he decides this to be fine particles of earth. The chief, and almost the only use of dung, he thinks, is to divide the earth, to dissolve “this terrestrial matter, which affords nutriment to the mouths of vegetable roots and this can be done more complcte-Iy[7:2:260] by tillage. It is therefore necessary not only to pulverize the soil by repeated ploughings before it be seeded, but, as it becomes gradually more and more compressed afterwards, recourse must be had to tillage while the plants are growing, and this is hoeing, which also destroys the weeds that would deprive the plants of their nourishment.

The leading features of Tull’s husbandry are his practice of laying the land into narrow ridges of five or six feet, and upon the middle of these drilling one, two, or three rows, distant from one another about seven inches when there were three, and ten inches when only two. The distance of the plants on one ridge from those on the contiguous one he called an interval ; the distance between the rows on the same ridge, a space or partition : the former was stirred repeatedly by the horse-hoe, the latter by the hand-hoe.

The extraordinary attention this ingenious person gave to his mode of culture is perhaps without a parallel :—·“I formerly was at much pains,” he says, “and at some charge in improving my drills for planting the rows at very near distances, and had brought them to such perfection, that one horse would draw a drill with eleven shares, making the rows at three inches and a half distance from one another; and at the same time sow in them three very different sorts of seeds, which did not mix; and these, too, at different depths. As the barleyrows were seven inches asunder, the barley lay four inches deep. A little more than three inches above that, in the same channels, was clover; betwixt every tw’o of these rows was a row of St Foin, covered half an inch deep.

“I had a good crop of barley the first year; the next year two crops of broad clover, where that was sown; and where hop-clover was sown, a mixed crop of that and St Foin; but I am since, by experience, so fully convinced of the folly of these, or any other mixed crops, and more especially of narrow spaces, that I have demolished these instruments in their full perfection as a vain curiosity, the drift and use of them being contrary to the true principles and practice of horse-hoeing.^[15. Horse-hoeing Husbandry, p. G2. Lond. 1762.]”

In the culture of wheat, he began with ridges six feet broad, or eleven on a breadth of 66 feet; but on this he afterwards had fourteen ridges. After trying different numbers of rows on a ridge, he at last preferred two, w ith an intervening space of about ten inches. He allowed only three pecks of seed for an acre. The first hoeing was performed by turning a furrow from the row, as soon as the plant had put forth four or five leaves; so that it was done before or at the beginning of winter. The next hoeing was in spring, by which the earth was returned to the plants. The subsequent operations depended upon the circumstances and condition of the land and the state of the weather. The next year’s crop of wheat was sown upon the intervals which had been unoccupied the former year; but this he does not seem to think was a matter of much consequence. “My field,” he observes, “whereon is now the thirteenth crop of wheat, has shown that the rows may successfully stand upon any part of the ground. The ridges of this field were, for the twelfth crop, changed from six feet to four feet six inches. In order for this alteration the ridges were ploughed down, and then the next ridges were laid out the same way as the former, but one foot six inches narrower, and the double rows drilled on their tops; whereby, of consequence, there must be some row’s standing on every part of the ground, both on the former partitions, and on every part of the intervals. Notwithstanding this, there was no manner of difference in the goodness of the row’s; and the whole field was in every part of it equal, and the best I believe that ever grew on it. It is now the thirteenth crop, likely to be good, though the land was not ploughed cross ways.”^[16. Ibid. P∙ 424.]

It follows from this singular management, that Tull thought a succession of crops of different species altogether unnecessary; and he labours hard to prove against Dr Woodward, that the advantages of such a change under his plan of tillage were quite chimerical; though he seems to admit the benefit of a change of the seed itself. But the best method of determining the question would have been to have stated the amount of his crops per acre, and the quality of the grain, instead of resting the superiority of his management on the alleged saving of expense, w hen compared with the common broad-cast husbandry.

On the culture of turnip, both his principles and his practice are much more correct. The ridges w ere of the same breadth as for wheat, but only one row’ was drilled on each. His management while the crop was growing differs very little from the present practice. When drilled on the level, it is impossible, he observes, to hoe-plough them so well as when they are planted upon ridges. But the seed was deposited at different depths, the half about four inches deep, and the other half exactly over that, at the depth of half an inch. “Thus planted, let the weather be never so dry, the deepest seed will come up; but if it raineth immediately after planting, the shallow’ will come up first. We also make it come up at four times, by mixing our seed half new and half old, the new coming up a day quicker than the old. These four comings up give it so many chances for escaping the fly; it being often seen that the seed sown over night will be destroyed by the fly, when that sown the next morning will escape, and vice versa : or you may hoe-plough them when the fly is like to devour them; this will bury the greatest part of these enemies: or else you may drill in another row w ithout new-ploughing the land.”

Drilling and horse and hand-hoeing seem to have been in use before the publication of Tull’s book. “Hoeing,” he says, “may be divided into deep, which is our horsehoeing; and shallow, which is the English hand-hoeing; and also the shallow’ horse-hoeing used in some places betw’ixt rows, where the intervals are very narrow, as 16 or 18 inches. This is but an imitation of the hand-hoe, or a succedaneum to it, and can neither supply the use of dung nor fallow, and may be properly called scratchhoeing.” But in his mode of forming ridges his practice seems to have been original; his implements display much ingenuity; and his claim to the title of father of the present horse-hoeing husbandry of Great Britain seems indisputable. A translation of Tull’s book was undertaken at one and the same time in France, by three different persons of consideration, without the privity of each other. Two of them afterw ards put their papers into the hands of the third, Μ. Du Hamel du Monceau of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, who published a treatise on husbandry, on the principles of Mr Tull, a few years after. But Tull seems to have had very few followers in England for more than 30 years. The present method of drilling and horse-hoeing turnips was not introduced into Northumberland till about the year 1780;^[17. Northumberland. Survey, p. 100.] and it was then borrowed from Scotland, the farmers of which had the merit of first adopting Tull’s management in the culture[7:2:261] of this root about 1760, and from whom it has since made its way, but slowly, into the southern part of the island.

Among the English writers of this period may be mentioned Bradley, Lawrence, Hales, Miller, Ellis, Smith, Hill, Hitt, Lisle, and Home. Most of their works went through several editions in a few years; at once a proof of the estimation in which they were held, and of the direction of the public mind towards investigating the principles and practice of agriculture.

Of the progress of the art in Scotland, till towards the end of the 17th century, we are almost entirely ignorant. The first work, written by Donaldson, was printed in 1697, under the title of Husbandry Anatomized; or, an Inquiry into the Present Manner of Teiling and Manuring the Ground in Scotland. It appears from this treatise, that the state of the art was not more advanced at that time in North Britain than it had been in England in the time of Fitzherbert. Farms were divided into infield and outfield; corn crops followed one another without the intervention of fallow, cultivated herbage, or turnips, though something is said about fallowing the outfield; inclosures were very rare; the tenantry had not begun to emerge from a state of great poverty and depression; and the wages of labour, compared with the price of com, were much lower than at present; though that price, at least in ordinary years, must appear extremely moderate in our times. Leases for a term of years, however, were not uncommon; but the want of capital rendered it impossible for the tenantry to attempt any spirited improvements.

Donaldson first points out the common management of that period, which he shows to have been very unproductive; and afterwards recommends what he thinks would be a more profitable course. “Of the dale ground,” he says, “that is, such lands as are partly hills and partly valleys, of which sorts may be comprehended the greatest part of arable ground in this kingdom, I shall suppose a fanner to have a lease or tack of three score acres, at three hundred merks of rent per annum (L.16. 13s. 4d. sterling). Perhaps some who are not acquainted with rural affairs may think this cheap; but those who are the possessors thereof think otherwise, and find difficulty enough to get the same paid, according to their present way of manuring thereof. But that I may proceed to the comparison, I shall show how commonly this farm-room is managed. It is commonly divided into two parts, viz. one-third croft, and two-thirds outfield, as it is termed. The croft is usually divided into three parts; to wit, one-third barley, which is always dunged that year barley is sown thereon; another third oats; and the last third peas. The outside field is divided into two parts, to wit, the one half oats, and the other half grass, two years successively. The product which may be supposed to be on each acre of croft, four bolls (three Winchester quarters), and that of the outfield, three (2^ quarters); the quota is seven score bolls, which we shall also reckon at five pounds (8s. 4d.) per boll, cheap year and dear year one with another. This, in all, is worth L.700 (L.58. 6s. 8d. sterling).

“Then let us see what profit he can make of his cattle. According to the division of his lands, there is 20 acres of grass, which cannot be expected to be very good, because it gets not leave to lie above two years, and therefore cannot be well swarded. However, usually, besides four horses, which are kept for ploughing the said land, ten or twelve nolt are also kept upon a farm-room of the above-mentioned bounds ∙, but, in respect of the badness of the grass, as said is, little profit is had of them. Perhaps two or three stone of butter is the most that can be made of the milk of his kine the whole summer, and not above two heffers brought up each year. As to what profit may be made by bringing up young horses, I shall say nothing, supposing he keeps his stock good by those of his own upbringing. The whole product, then, of his cattle cannot be reckoned above fifty merks (L.2. 15s. 6d.). For, in respect his beasts are in. a manner half-starved, they are generally small; so that scarce may a heffer be sold at above twelve pounds (L.l sterling). The whole product of this farm-room, therefore, exceeds not the value of L.733 (L.61. Is. 8d. sterling), or thereabout.” The labourers employed on this farm were two men and one woman, besides a herd in summer, and other servants in harvest.

Donaldson then proceeds to point out a different mode of management, which he calculates to be more profitable; but no notice is taken of either clover or turnips as crops to be raised in his new course, though they are incidentally noticed in other parts of the work.

“I also recommend potatoes as a very profitable root for husbandmen and others that have numerous families. And because there is a peculiar way of planting this root, not commonly known in this country, I shall here show what way it is ordinarily planted or set. The ground must be dry; and so much the better it is if it have a good soard of grass. The beds or riggs are made about eight foot broad, good store of dung being laid upon your ground; horse or sheep dung is the proper manure for them. Throw each potatoe or sett (for they were sometimes cut into setts) into a knot of dung, and afterwards dig earth out of the furrows, and cover them all over, about some three or four inches deep; the furrows left between your riggs must be about two foot broad, and little less will they be in depth before your potatoes be covered. You need not plant this root in your garden; they are commonly set in the fields, and wildest of ground, for enriching of it.” As to their consumption, they were sometimes “boiled and broken, and stirred with butter and new milk; also roasted, and eaten with butter; yea, some make bread of them, by mixing them with oat or barley meal; others parboil them, and bake them with apples, after the manner of tarts.”

There is a good deal in this little treatise about sheep, and other branches of husbandry; and, if the writer was well informed, as in most instances he appears to have been, his account of prices, of wages, and generally of the practices of that period, is very interesting.

The next work on the husbandry of Scotland is, The Countrymans Rudiments, or an advice to the Farmers in East Lothian, how to labour and improve their grounds ; said to have been written by Lord Belhaven about the time of the Union, and reprinted in 1723. In this we have a deplorable picture of the state of agriculture in what is now the most highly improved county in Scotland. His lordship begins with a very high encomium on his own performance. “I dare be bold to say, there was never such a good easy method of husbandry as this, so succinct, extensive, and methodical in all its parts, published before.” And he bespeaks the favour of those to whom he addresses himself, by adding, “neither shall I affright you with hedging, ditching, marling, chalking, paring and burning, draining, watering, and Such like, which are all very good improvements indeed, and very agreeable with the soil and situation of East Lothian; but I know ye cannot bear as yet a crowd of improvements, this being only intended to initiate you in the true method and principles of husbandry.” The farm-rooms in East Lothian, as in other districts, were divided into infield and outfield. “The infield (where wheat is sown) is generally divided by the tenant into four divisions, or breaks, as they call them, viz. one [7:2:262] of wheat, one of barley, one of pease, and one of oats; so that the wheat is sowed after the pease, the barley after the wheat, and the oats after the barley. The outfield land is ordinarily made use of promiscuously for feeding of their cows, horse, sheep, and oxen; , tis also dunged by their sheep, who lay in earthen folds; and sometimes, when they have much of it, they fauch or fallow a part of it yearly.” Under this management the produce seems to have been three times the seed; and yet, says his lordship, “if in East Lothian they did not leave a higher stubble than in other places of the kingdom, their grounds would be in a much worse condition than at present they are, though bad enough.”—» A good crop of corn makes a good stubble, and a good stubble is the equalest mucking that is.” Among the advantages of inclosures, he observes, “you will gain much more labour from your servants, a great part of whose time was taken up in gathering thistles and other garbage for their horses to feed upon in their stables; and thereby the great trampling and pulling up, and other destruction of the corns, while they are yet tender, will be prevented.” Potatoes and turnips are recommended to be sown in the yard (kitchen-garden). Clover does not seem to have been in use. Rents were paid in corn; and, for the largest farm, which he thinks should employ no more than two ploughs, the rent was about six chalders of victual “w hen the ground •is very good, and four in that which is not so good. But I am most fully convinced they should take long leases or tacks, that they may not be straitened with time in the improvement of their rooms; and this is profitable both for master and tenant.”

Such was the state of the husbandry of Scotland in the early part of last century. The first attempts at improvement cannot be traced farther back than 1723, when a number of landholders formed themselves into a society, under the title of the Society of Improvers in the Knowledge of Agriculture in Scotland. The earl of Stair, one of their most active members, is said to have been the first who cultivated turnips in that country. The Select Transactions of this society were collected and published in 1743 by Mr Maxwell, who took a large part in its proceedings. It is evident from this book that the society had exerted itself in a very laudable manner, and apparently with considerable success, in introducing cultivated herbage and turnips, as well as in improving the former methods of culture. But there is reason to believe that the influence of the example of its numerous members did not extend to the common tenantry, who are always unwilling to adopt the practices of those who are placed in a higher rank, and supposed to cultivate land for pleasure rather than profit. Though this society, the earliest probably in the United Kingdom, soon counted up-wards of 300 members, it existed little more than 20 years. Maxwell delivered lectures on agriculture for one or two sessions at Edinburgh, which, from the specimen he has left, ought to have been encouraged.

In the introductory paper in Maxwell’s collection, we are told, that “the practice of draining, inclosing, summer fallowing, sowing flax, hemp, rape, turnip and grass seeds, planting cabbages after, and potatoes with, the plough, in fields of great extent, is introduced; and that, according to the general opinion, more corn grows now yearly where it was never known to grow before, these twenty years last past, than perhaps a sixth of all that the kingdom was in use to produce at any time before.”

• In this work we find the. first notice of a threshing-machine; it was invented by Mr Michael Menziesj advocate, who obtained a patent for it. Upon a representation made to the society that it was to be seen working in several places, they appointed two of their number to inspect it; and in their report they say, that one man would be sufficient to manage a machine which would do the work of six. One of the machines was “moved by a great waterwheel and triddles,” and another “by a little wheel of three feet diameter, moved by a small quantity of water.” This machine the society recommended to all gentlemen and farmers.

The next work is by the same Mr Maxwell, printed in 1757, and entitled the Practical Husbandman; being a collection of miscellaneous papers on Husbandry, &ò. In this book the greater part of the Select Transactions is republished, with a number of new papers, among which, an Essay on the Husbandry of Scotland, with a proposal for the improvement of it, is the most valuable. In this he lays it down as a rule, that it is bad husbandry to take two crops of grain successively, which marks a considerable progress in the knowledge of modern husbandry; though he adds, that in Scotland the best husbandmetι after a fallow take a crop of wheat; after the wheat, peas; then barley, and then oats; and after that they fallow again. The want of inclosures was still a matter of complaint. The ground continued to be cropped so long as it produced two seeds; the best farmers were contented with four seeds, which was more than the general produce.

The first act of parliament for collecting tolls on the highway in Scotland was passed in 1750, for repairing the road from Dunglass bridge to Haddington. In ten years after, several acts followed for the counties of Edinburgh and Lanark, and for making the roads between Edinburgh and Glasgow. The benefit which agriculture has derived from good roads, it would not be easy to estimate. The want of them -was one great cause of the slow progress of the art in former times.

The Revolution in 1688 was the epoch of that system of corn laws to which very great influence has been ascribed, both on the practice of agriculture and the general prosperity of the country. But for an account of these and later statutes on the subject, we must refer to the article Corn Laws.

The exportation of wool was prohibited in 1647, in 1660, and in 1688; and the prohibition strictly enforced by subsequent statutes. The effect of this on its price, and the state of the wool trade,’ from the earliest period to the middle of last century, are distinctly exhibited by the learned and laborious author of Memoirs on Wool, printed in 1747.

The gradual advance in the price of land produce soon after the year 1760, occasioned by the increase of population, and of wealth derived from manufactures and commerce, has given a more powerful stimulus to rural industry, augmented agricultural capital in a greater degree, and called forth a more skilful and enterprising race of cultivators, than all the laws for regulating the corn trade could ever have effected. Most of the inventions for increasing produce and economizing labour have either been introduced, or improved and greatly extended, since that time; and by means of both, the free surplus has been vastly increased for the supply of the general consumption. The passing of more than 3000 bills òf inclosure, in the late reign, before which the whole number was only 244, is a proof how much more rapidly the cultivation of new land has proceeded than formerly; and the garden-like appearance of the country, as well as the striking improvement in the condition of all classes of the rural population, display, in the most decided manner, the skill and the success with which this great branch of national industry is now followed throughout the greater part of Britain. ' l [7:2:263] In a view of the progress of husbandry, any considerable improvements in the species of crops cultivated, and the order in which they succeed one another, in agricultural machinery, and in the kinds and varieties of live stock, are entitled to hold a very prominent place. Our limits do not permit us to do more than just to notice a few of the most important here; but we shall have occasion to describe them more fully in the second part of this article, when treating on the practice and present state of our agriculture.

The great line of distinction between the present and the former courses of cropping, consists in the alternation of what are called exhausting and ameliorating crops. The best cultivators rarely take two corn crops in succession; but corn is almost universally succeeded by a leguminous crop, or one of herbage, cut or pastured, or turnips, cabbages, rape, &c.; or, when the soil is not suited to turnips, by a summer fallow, recurring at as distant an interval as its condition will permit. In common language, a green or a pulse crop, or a plain fallow, is interposed between every two white corn crops. These green crops not only preserve the fertility of the soil, but when sown in rows, as most of them usually are, they afford an opportunity of extirpating weeds, by the use of the horse and hand hoe; and even when sown broad-cast, by their taking complete possession of the ground, if it is properly prepared, the growth of weeds is effectually checked. In other respects, these intermediate crops are of the utmost importance in every good course of management. Whether they be eaten on the ground or carried to the farm houses and straw yards, much valuable manure is obtained from their consumption; and on sandy or gravelly soils, when only a part of a turnip crop is eaten by sheep on the ground, the greatest defect of such land is removed by their treading, and in many cases it is rendered capable of producing as valuable a crop of wheat as soils of a closer texture. It is for these reasons that, by the cultivation of clover, and turnips in particular, in regular alternation with corn, the soil is so much enriched as to yield as much corn on the half of any given extent of land as the whole did under the old course of successive crops of corn; and, unless upon strong clays, an unproductive fallow is wholly dispensed with.

But these crops are not less valuable in another point of view. Before the introduction of clover and turnips, there was nothing for the maintenance of live‘stock but natural herbage in summer, with the addition of hay and straw in winter; and in the northern parts of the island in particular, where the winters are long and severe, it was seldom possible to do more, for about half the year, than preserve cattle and sheep from starving. Even in the most favourable situations, very little butcher-meat could be brought to market from December to June, unless at an expense which the great body of consumers were quite unable to reimburse. The more early maturity of cattle and sheep, and the regular supply of the market throughout the year, are therefore chiefly owing to turnips and clover, as well as the vast increase in the number of the live stock kept on arable land, and the great degree of perfection to which some breeds have been brought by the skilful experiments of several eminent agriculturists.

Among these, the first place is unquestionably due to Mr Robert Bakewell of Dìshley, in Leicestershire. By his skilful selection at first, and constant care afterwards, to breed from the best animals, he at last obtained a variety of sheep, which, for early maturity, and the property of returning a great produce of mutton for the food they consume, as well as for the small proportion which the weight of the offal bears to that of the four quarters, are altogether unequalled either in this or any other country. The Dishley or new Leicester sheep, and their crosses, are now spread over the principal corn districts of Britain; and, from their quiet domesticated habits, are probably still the most profitable of all the varieties of sheep, on farms where the rearing and fattening of live stock are combined with the best courses of tillage crops.

The practice of Mr Bakewell and his followers furnishes an instance of the benefits of the division of labour, in a department of business where it was little to be expected. Their males were let out every year to breeders from all parts of England; and thus, by judiciously crossing the old races, all the valuable properties of the Dish-ley variety descended, after three or lour generations, to their posterity. By no other means could this new breed have spread so rapidly, or been made to accommodate itself so easily to a change of climate and pasture. Another recommendation of this plan was, that the ram-hirer had a choice among a number of males of somewhat different properties, and in a more or less advanced stage of improvement, from which it was his business to select such as suited his particular object. These were reared by experienced men, who gave their principal attention to this branch alone; and having the best females as well as males, they were able to furnish the necessary supply of young males in the greatest variety, to those farmers whose time was occupied with other pursuits. The prices at which Mr BakewelΓs rams were hired appear enormous. In 1789 he received twelve hundred guineas for the hire of three brought at one birth; two thousand for seven; and for his whole letting, at least three thousand guineas.

Merino sheep were first brought into England in 1788, when his late Majesty procured "a small flock by way of Portugal. In 1791 another flock was imported from Spain. In 1804, when the annual sales commenced, this race began to attract much notice. Dr Parry of Bath crossed the Ryeland or Herefordshire sheep with the Merinos, and brought the wool of the fourth generation to a degree of fineness not excelled, it is said, by that of the pure Merino itself; while the carcass, in which the great defect of the Merinos consists, has been much improved. Lord Somerville and many other gentlemen have bestowed much attention on this valuable race, which, however, has not spread itself over the country; and the wool is understood to have deteriorated.

One of the most valuable plants introduced into cultivation since 1760 is the ruta baga or Swedish turnip, which in a great degree supplies the great desideratum of late spring food for live stock, after the common turnip is generally much damaged, and sometimes almost wholly destroyed, by the severity and changes of the weather. The Scotish yellow turnip is for the same reason a most useful variety, coming in between the white turnips and the Swedish, in some situations supplying the place of the latter, and yielding generally a larger produce. A new variety of oats, called the potato oat, was accidentally discovered in 1788. It comes early, and gives, a large produce both in grain and in meal, on good soils; and was soon cultivated over all the north of England and south of Scotland. But it has already begun to degenerate. A good many varieties of summer wheat have been introduced of late, but they arc only partially cultivated.

Under the head of agricultural machinery, we need only notice the improvement of the swing-plough by Small, and of the threshing-machine by Meikle; though the latter may rather claim the entire merit of the invention.
[7:2:264]

We shall have Occasion to notice in its proper place the progress that has been made towards perfecting a machine for reaping corn, still an important desideratum.

The agriculture of Scotland has been benefited by an act in 1770, which relaxed the rigour of strict entails, and extended the powers of proprietors, in so far as regards the improvement of their estates and the granting of leases; but there is still much room for improvement in this branch of our legal polity.

There is nothing that shows more clearly the rapid progress of agriculture in Britain, than the great number of societies that have been lately formed, one or more in almost every county, for the diffusion of knowledge, and the encouragement of correct operations and beneficial discoveries. We have already noticed the Society of Improvers established in Scotland in 1723. Besides those respectable associations which have for their object the encouragement of arts, manufactures, and commerce generally, several large institutions have been formed, whose chief purpose is the improvement of agriculture. Among these the Bath and West of England Society, established in 1777, and the Highland Society of Scotland, in 1784, hold a conspicuous rank; nor ought we to pass over in silence the labours of the National Board of Agriculture, formed in 1793, but since abolished, which by means of the county-surveys has made us acquainted with the rural affairs of every part of the kingdom.

A great many excellent works on agriculture, and relative subjects, have been published since 1760; and among these several periodical miscellanies have been favourably received and widely circulated. But as they are comparatively recent, and the best of them well known, it is unnecessary to give any particular account either of their merits or defects.

Part II.

The Practice of British Agriculture.

We come now to our leading object, the present state of British agriculture, especially as it is found in our best cultivated counties. It is not our purpose to exhibit general views of a statistical nature,—such as the extent and produce of our territory, considered under the several divisions of corn-land, pastures, and wastes or tracts still in a state of nature. The proportion which each of these bears to the whole cannot perhaps be fixed with tolerable accuracy at any time, and is continually varying; and with regard to the aggregate produce, we have seen nothing but conjectural estimates, which, as might be expected, differ greatly from one another.

The first thing which naturally calls for our attention in a treatise on the practice of agriculture is the Soil, which may be termed the raw material on which the cultivator has to operate, and according to the nature of which his general management as well as his labour in detail must in a great measure be regulated.

In penetrating the superficial stratum, the first circumstance which presents itself is the different degree of resistance required to be overcome in different situations. Its component parts are found to be more or less cohesive; in some places nearly all of the same consistency, and in others mixed with decayed roots and small stones. The colour is also different, without any perceptible difference in other respects. These are the obvious varieties which occur immediately beneath the surface, or in what is properly called the soil; but upon going a little deeper, the texture and colour undergo further changes, even in the same situation. A compact, impervious mass, often imbedded with stones, sometimes succeeds to a superficial stratum of the most incohesive materials: elsewhere, the solid and dense surface soil passes, though commonly by slower gradations, into a substratum of an opposite description; and in many parts the rock itself, from which the soil is supposed to have been formed, rises so near the surface as to stop all further progress.

In addition to these obvious distinctions, it is soon observed that some soils are slow to admit moisture, and do not speedily part with it, but when dried become so indurated as to be reduced to a pulverulent state with great difficulty; while others are so porous as to allow water to pass through them freely, and so open to the influence of the atmosphere, that if it meets with any obstruction from the subsoil, it is very soon carried off by evaporation.

In the classification of soils with a view to practical utility, therefore, they may be all reduced under two general divisions, according to their texture. The terms stiff, heavy, strong, cohesive, and others of the same import, all denote soils of which the basis or principal ingredient is clay ; as, on the other hand, those in which sand predominates are called loose, light, porous, friable. Under each of these divisions, however, there are several varieties, such as gravel, loam, chalk, calcareous, alluvial, peaty, &c.; to which are added the common epithets of rich and poor, cold and hot, thin or shallow, and deep, and various others.

Of the crops best suited to these several kinds of soil, it is only necessary to observe here, that wheat, beans, clovers, and fibrous-rooted plants generally, are most productive on clays; while barley, turnips, and all bulbous and deep-rooted plants, thrive best in sandy soils. Loam, which may partake of either character, is an artificial soil, produced by cultivation and manure, and, when sufficiently deep, adapted to crops of every kind. Gravelly soils, which are usually considered as forming a distinct class, take their character from that of the rocky materials in which they abound. When very loose and porous, they are sometimes called hungry, the manure applied to them being as it were devoured and lost, from the want of materials in a state to be acted upon; but those of a better quality are not only productive both in com and pasture, but their crops ripen very early. Calcareous matter, such as lime, chalk, and marl, is a necessary ingredient in all fertile soils, without which, indeed, it has been found impracticable to bring most crops to perfection. The soils formed by matters deposited by the tides and by rivers, called alluvial, usually consist of a variety of ingredients, and are for the most part very fertile. What is called a mossy or peaty soil is distinguished by its dark colour and spongy texture, and abounds in the roots of plants in a state of decay, from which, indeed, it seems to have been wholly formed. It is found in a great variety of situations, on the summits of mountains as well as in plains and hollows; in some cases so saturated with water as not to bear the weight of cattle, in others in so solid a form as to be cut for fuel; sometimes of the depth of many feet, and elsewhere of only a few inches; but in all situations its produce of stunted heath, occasionally intermixed with coarse herbage, is of little or no value. This description of soil, if it deserves the name, is of comparatively recent formation, having been found in several instances superincumbent upon cultivated soils which themselves appear to be alluvial, and consequently not of the earliest class. The terms moor and moorish are applied generally to inferior soils in a state of nature, whatever may be their distinctive character in other respects.

The quality of soils may sometimes be judged of with tolerable accuracy, by attending to the species of plants which they naturally produce, and observing whether they [7:2:265] grow close and vigorous, so as to cover the soil completely, or rise feeble and scattered, with unoccupied spaces between. The clovers, for instance, grow freely on calcareous soils, and the common ragwort (senecio Jacoboea) and the corn-thistle (serratula Arυensis) usually indicate a fertile soil, whatever be its texture. Science has supplied other tests, for which we may refer to Sir Humphry Davy’s Agricultural Chemistry. One of the simplest methods of ascertaining the presence of calcareous matter in the soil, is to pour upon it any strong acid, with which, if this ingredient abounds, it will effervesce freely. The power of retaining moisture, and, when dry, of absorbing it from the atmosphere, as well as the greater increase of temperature, which under the same circumstances takes place in some soils,—these and various other criteria may be employed to determine their comparative fertility.’ And, what is not unworthy of remark, it is known from experience that the productiveness of the soil, under similar circumstances m other respects, depends in some measure on the dryness or humidity of the climate. In the west of Scotland, for instance, where much more rain falls than in the east, light sandy soils do not suffer so much under a severe course of cropping as they are found to do in the latter situation.

In describing the practice of agriculture, it may be thought that the process by which lands in a state of nature are first brought into cultivation would be entitled to our earliest consideration, and that wc should then proceed to describe the successive operations by which our fields have arrived at their present condition. But a moment's reflection may convince us that such an arrangement would be inexpedient, if not impracticable, on the present occasion. The original state of much of our cultivated land, which has long since passed away, must have been very different in different situations, and would require a corresponding variety of operations to prepare it for growing corn; and a number of implements, however rude, must have been constructed, even before these operations could be commenced. It is only in an advanced stage of the art, and as a branch of general management, that the culture of wastes can demand our attention; for it is then only that capital and science may enable us to cultivate them with advantage.

But without pretending to scientific arrangement, we shall content ourselves with bringing together those parts of our subject that have a mutual relation and dependence on one another in practice, and endeavour to present its more important details under the four following chapters.

In the first, we shall treat of what regards the cultivation and products of arable land ; in the second, of the management of grass lands, and the improvement of wastes ; in the third, of agricultural live stock ; and in the fourth, which will be of a more general kind, wc shall endeavour to point out those circumstances which have more particularly contributed to the improvement of agriculture in this country, and those also which seem still to obstruct its further advancement.

There are, besides the subjects which fall to be treated under these divisions, some others, which certainly form component parts of agricultural science, and to which it will be necessary to advert in this work; but as these subjects are not of equal interest to husbandmen generally, and as they are capable of being treated with advantage in a separate form, we shall reserve them for distinct articles, to be afterwards introduced under their respective heads. Such are the subjects of the Dairy, of Drainage, of Embankment, of Irrigation, and of Woods and Plantations.
