AMBOHITSMENE, or Vohitsanghombe, a province of the island of Madagascar, so called from some red mountains of the same name lying in lat. 20. S. These mountains are very high, resembling the Tafelberg of the Cape of Good Hope. On one side of this ridge the sea extends into the country for fifteen leagues; on the other is a flat country, abounding in ponds and marshes. Here is also a lake of 15 leagues in length, and the same in breadth, containing many small islands. The inhabitants of the mountains are called Zaferahongs, and have plenty of gold, iron, cattle, silk, &c.
