ADVENT, in the calendar, properly signifies the approach of the feast of the nativity. It includes four Sundays, and begins on St Andrew’s day or on the Sunday before or after it. During advent, and to the end of the octaves of epiphany, the solemnizing of marriage is forbidden without a special licence. It is appointed to employ the thoughts of Christians on the first advent or coming of Christ in the flesh, and his second advent or coming to judge the world. The primitive Christians practised great austerity during this season.

Ad ventrem inspiciendum, in Law, a writ by which a woman is to be searched whether she be with child by a former husband, on her withholding lands from the next, failing issue of her own body.

ADVENTURE Day, the name of a bay in Van Diemen’s Land, so called by Captain Cook.
