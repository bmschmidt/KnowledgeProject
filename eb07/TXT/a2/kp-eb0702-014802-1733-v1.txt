ADELME, or Aldhelm, son to Kenred, nephew to Ina, king of the West Saxons, was bishop of Sherburn in the time of the Heptarchy. He was the first Englishman who wrote in Latin, and the first who made any considerable attempts in versification. He lived in great esteem till his death, which happened in 709. He was canonized, and many miraeles were ascribed to him. He is mentioned with great honour by Camden and Bale; and his life was written by William of Malmesbury.
