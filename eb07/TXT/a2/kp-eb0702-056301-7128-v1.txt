ALPUJARRAS, a mountainous district in the province of Granada, in the south of Spain, to which the Moors of the capital were banished after the destruction of their kingdom under Ferdinand and Isabella. It is a range parallel to the Sierra Nevada, but separated from it by the river Grande, which runs to the Mediterranean by Mo-tril. The mountains are composed of a clayey slate highly favourable to the culture of the vine, and produce the wine called Pedro-Ximenes, so highly prized in Spain. The declivity of this range is very rapid to the north, but on the south the descent towards the Mediterranean Sea is very gradual, and the inclined planes are highly prolific. The highest part of the range is the Sierra de Luxar, which has an elevation of 6550 feet, and is covered with snow eight months of the year.
