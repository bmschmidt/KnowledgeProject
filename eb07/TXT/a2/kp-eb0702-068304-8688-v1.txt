ANAMIM, the second son of Mizraim. (Gen. x. 13.) Anamim, if wc may credit the paraphrast Jonathan the son of Uzziel, peopled the Mareotis; or the Pentapolis of Gyrene, according to the paraphrast of Jerusalem. Bo-chart is of opinion that these Anamims were the people that dwelt in the parts adjacent to the temple of Jupiter Ammon, and in the Nasamonitis. Calme t thinks that the Amanians and Garamantes are descended from Ana-mim.
