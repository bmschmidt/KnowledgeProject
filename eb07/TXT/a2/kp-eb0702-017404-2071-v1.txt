AEON, a Greek word, properly signifying the age or duration of any thing.

Aeon, among the followers of Plato, was used to signify any virtue, attribute, or perfection: hence they represented the deity as an assemblage of all possible aeons, and called him pleroma, a Greek term signifying fulness. The Valentinians, who, in the first ages of the church, blended the conceits of the Jewish cabalists, the Platonists, and the Chaldean philosophers, with the simplicity of the Christian doctrine, invented a kind of Theogony, or Gene-«, alogy of Gods (not unlike that of Hesiod), whom they called by several glorious names, and all by the general appellation of Aeons : among which they reckoned Zωη, life; Λογάς, word; Μονογoνης, only-begotten; Hληgωμα, fulness ; and many other divine powers and emanations, amounting in number to thirty; which they fancied to be successively derived from one another, and all from one self-originated deity, named Pythus, i. e. profound or unfathomable ; whom they called likewise, the most high and' ineffable father.
