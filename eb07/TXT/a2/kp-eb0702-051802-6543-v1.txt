ALLAN, David, a Scotish historical painter of considerable eelebrity, was born at Alloa, on the 13th February 1744. At a very early age he showed sueh marks of genius as attracted the notice of some gentlemen living in the neighbourhood. In a remote part of the eountry, and deprived of the ordinary means of indulging his propensity to drawing, he betook himself, when a boy, to sueh implements and materials as he could readily procure; and the meehanical skill and taste whieh, in particular, he displayed in using his knife, have been mentioned as remarkable for his years. Mr Stewart, then collector of the Customs at Alloa, having mentioned these proofs of natural talent to Mr Foulis the printer, who some time before had instituted an aeademy in Glasgow for painting and engraving, he invited young Allan to study under his care. Here he remained about seven years, studying the elementary principles of his art; and, by the proficiency whieh he attained, justified the opinion of his talents whieh had procured him admission to that ill-fated seminary. But although the publie taste for the fine arts, whieh then existed in Scotland, was so feeble as to leave his preceptor without support, whieh his liberal and spirited efforts justly elaimed, Allan, on leaving the aeademy, had the good fortune to gain the patronage of individuals whose generosity enabled him to proseeute his views, and to improve his taste, by studying the works of art abroad. At the joint expense of several persons of fortune, particularly Lord Catheart and Mr Abererombie of Tullibody, he was enabled to go to Italy; and at Rome he devoted himself with great zeal to his profession. Here he remained for no less a period than sixteen years, during which time his subsistence ehiefly depended on the copies whieh he made from the most celebrated pictures of the aneient masters. Among the original works which he then painted, there was one which does the highest credit to his talents, and whieh gained for him the gold'medal given by the Academy of St Luke, in the year 1773, for the best specimen of historical composition. This picture represents the Origin of Painting, and is well known by the excellent engraving of it by Cunego. His design of the Calabrian Shepherds is also a composition of great merit; and his four views of the Carnivals at Rome, etehed by Paul Sandby, are said likewise to have been very sueeessful.

On his return to his native country, he took up his residence in Edinburgh, and soon after, on the death of Alexander Runciman, in 1786, was appointed director and master of the aeademy established by the Board of Trustees for Manufactures in Scotland. There he executed a great variety of works, of various degrees of merit; but perhaps none sueh as might have been expected from the author of the Origin of Painting. Those, indeed, by whieh he is most known, are of a east altogether different, being remarkable for the eomie humour whieh they display. The Scotch Wedding, the Highland Dance, the Repentance Stool, with his Illustrations of the Gentle Shepherd, are all of this elass, and so generally known, from his own spirited etchings in aqua-tinta, as to need no description. Of his graver compositions, the Prodigal Son, in possession of Lord Catheart, and his Hercules and Omphale, in the possession of Mr Erskine of Mar, are regarded as works of great merit.

As an artist, Mr Allan possessed much facility of invention, with a keen discernment of those evanescent eireumstanees in the outward form whieh mark the different shades of passion and affeetion in the mind. With the talent of artfully arranging the various parts of a crowded and bustling seene, sueh as appears in some of his eomic produetions, he possessed that feeling for simplicity which gives to his graver compositions a classical and antique air of eleganeeâˆ™ In his drawing he was often hasty and ineorreet. He executed a great variety of etchings and drawings in water eolours, which are valuable, on aeeount of their excellent humour, and the great knowledge of national character whieh they express. We do not know that Allan left any pupil who has followed his particular line in painting; but among those who received from him the rudiments of art while he continued master of the aeademy, we may name the late Mr Hugh W. Williams, whose genius, however, directed him to a different eourse, whieh conducted him to high and merited distinction as a landscape painter.

Mr Allan is remembered and spoken of as an excellent private character. He died at Edinburgh on the 6th of August 1796, in the 53d year of his age.
