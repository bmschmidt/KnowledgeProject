AMADOW, a kind of black match, tinder, or touchwood, which comes from Germany. It is made o f u , sort of large mushrooms or spongy excrescences, which commonly grow on old trees, especially oaks, ash, and firs. This substance being boiled in common water, and afterwards dried and well beaten, is then put into a strong ley prepared with saltpetre, after which it is again put to dry in an oven. The druggists sell this match wholesale in France, and several hawkers retail it. Some give to the amadow the name of pyrotechnical sponge, because of its aptness to take fire.
