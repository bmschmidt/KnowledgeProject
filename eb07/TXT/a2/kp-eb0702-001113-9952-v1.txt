It contains one city, 10 market towns, and 227 villages. The inhabitants are about 140,000, mostly Catholics; the remainder Lutherans, Calvinists, and Greek church, with some Jews. The chief productions are com, flax, hemp, tobacco, fruit, wine, arid wood. There are also valuable quarries of marble.
