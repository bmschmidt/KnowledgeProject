ACATHISTUS, the name of a solemn hymn or vigil, anciently sung in the Greek church on the Saturday of the fifth week of Lent, in honour of the Virgin, for having thrice delivered Constantinople from the invasions of the barbarous nations. It was denominated ακα∂ιστος, i. e. without sitting, because, in the celebration of the praises of the Virgin, the people stood all night singing.
