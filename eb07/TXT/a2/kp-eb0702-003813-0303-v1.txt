ABNOBA, now Abenow, in Geography, a long range of mountains in Germany, extending from the Rhine toÂ· the Necker, and having different names according to the different countries through which they stretch. About the river Maine they are called the Oden or Otenwald ; between Hesse and Franconia, the Spessart ; and about the duchy of Wirtemberg, where the Danube takes its rise, they receive the name of Baar.
