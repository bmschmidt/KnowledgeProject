AIUS Locutius, . the name of a deity to whom the Romans erected an altar. The words are Latin, and signify “a speaking voiee.” The following accident gave occasion to the Romans erecting an altar to Aius Locutius. One Μ. Seditius, a plebeian, acquainted the tribunes that, in walking the streets by night, he had heard a voice over the temple of Vesta, giving the· Romans notice that the Gauls were coming against them. The intimation was, however, neglected; but after the truth was confirmed by the event, Camillus acknowledged this voice to be a new deity, and erected an altar to it under the namo of Aius Locutius.
