ADLOCUTION, Adlocutio, in Antiquity, is ehiefly understood of speeches made by Roman generals to their armies, to encourage them before a battle. We frequently find those adloeutions expressed on medals by the abbreviature Adlocut. Con.â€”The general is sometimes represented as seated on a tribunal, often on a bank or mound of turf, with the cohorts ranged orderly round him, in manipuli and turrnae. The usual formula in adloeutions was, Fords esset ac fidus.
