ACHAIA, a name taken for that part of Greece which Ptolemy calls Hellas, the younger Pliny Graecia ; now called Livadia. Λchαiα Propria, anciently a small district in the north of Peloponnesus, running westward along the, bay of Co.- rinth, and bounded on the west by the Ionian Sea, on the south by Elis and Arcadia, and on the east> by Sicyonia: inhabitants, the Achaeans, properly so called; its metropolis Patrae. It is now called Romania Alta, in, the Morea.

ACHΑiΑ also denoted all those countries that joined in the Achaean league, reduced by the Romans to a province. Likewise for Peloponnesus.

AcHAiAe Presbyteri, or the Presbyters of Achaia, were those who were present at the martyrdom of St Andrew the apostle, A. p. 59; and are said to have written an epistle iń relation to it. Bellarmin, and several other eminent writers in the church of Rome, allow it to be genuine; while Du Pin and some others expressly reτ ject it.
