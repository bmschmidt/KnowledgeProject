ALBERT, Margrave of Brandenburg, and the last grand master of the Teutonic order, laid aside the habit of his order, embraced Lutheranism, and concluded a peace at Cracow in 1525, by which he was acknowledged duke of the east part of Prussia (formerly called for that reason Ducal Prussia), but to be held as a fief of Poland, and to descend to his male heirs. See Prussia.
