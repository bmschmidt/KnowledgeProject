ALSIRAT, in the Mahometan Theology, denotes a bridge laid over the middle of hell, finer than a hair, and sharper than the edge of a sword, over which people are to pass, after their trial, on the day of judgment. To add to the difficulty of the.pa≈üsage, Mahomet affirms, that the Alsirat, narrow as it is, is beset with briers and thorns; none of which, however, will be any impediment to the good, who shall fly over it like the wind, Mahomet and his Mussulmans leading the way; whereas the wicked, by the narrowness of the path, the entangling of the thorns, and extinction of the light which directed the former to paradise, shall soon miss their footing, and tumble headlong into hell, which is gaping beneath to receive them.
