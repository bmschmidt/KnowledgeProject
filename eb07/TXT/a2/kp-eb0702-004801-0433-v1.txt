ABUNDANTIA, a heathen divinity, represented in ancient monuments under the figure of a woman with a pleasing aspect, crowned with garlands of flowers, pouring all sorts of fruits out of a horn which she holds in her right hand, and scattering grain with her left, taken promiscuously from a sheaf of corn. On a medal of Trajan she is represented with two cornucopiae.
