AERARIUM, the treasury or place where the public money was deposited amongst the Romans.

Aerarium Ilithyae, or Jdnonis Lucinae, was where the moneys were deposited whieh parents paid for the birth of eaeh ehild.

Aerarium Privatum was the emperor’s privy purse, or the plaee where the money arising from his private patrimony was deposited.

Aerarium Sanctius contained the moneys arising from the twentieth part of all legacies: this was kept for the extreme necessities of the state.

Aerarium Vicesimarum, the plaee where the money arising from the taxes levied from foreign countries was laid up; so ealled because it most commonly consisted of a twentieth part of the produce.

There are several other treasuries mentioned in history, as the Aerarium Juνmtutis, Veneris, &c. The temple of

Saturn was the publie treasury of Rome, either because Saturn first taught the Italians to coin money, or, which is most likely, because this temple was the strongest and most seeure, and therefore the fittest plaee for that purpose.

Aerarium differs from Fiscus, as the first contained the publie money, the seeond that of the prinee. The two are, however, sometimes indiscriminately used for eaeh other.
