AGEMOGL Î›NS, Agiamoglans, or Azamoglans, in the Turkish Polity, are children purchased from the Tartars, or raised every third year, by way of tribute, from the Christians tolerated in the Turkish empire. These, after being circumcised and instructed in the religion and language of their tyrannical masters, are taught the exercises of war, till they are of a proper age for carrying arms; and from this corps the janizaries are recruited. With regard to those who are thought unfit for the army, they are employed in the lowest offices of the seraglio. Their appointments also are very small, not exceeding seven aspers and a half per day, which amount to about threepence halfpenny of our money.
