AHOLIB ΛH and Aπolah are two feigned names made use of by Ezekiel (xxiii. 4) to denote the two kingdoms of Judah and Samaria. Aholah and Aholibah are represented as two sisters of Egyptian extraction. Aholah stands for Samaria, and Aholibah for Jerusalem. The first signifies a tent ; and the second, my tent is in her. They both prostituted themselves to the Egyptians and Assyrians, in imitating their abominations and idolatries; for which reason they were abandoned to those very people for whom they had shown so passionate and so impure an affection. They were carried into captivity, and reduced to the severest servitude.
