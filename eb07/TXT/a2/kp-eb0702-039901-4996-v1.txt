ALEMBIC, a chemical vessel, usually made of glass or copper, formerly used for distillation. The bottom part, which contained the subject for distillation, is called, from its shape, the cucurbit; the upper part, which receives and condenses the steam, is called the head, the beak of which is fitted into the neck of a receiver. Retorts, and the common worm still, are now more generally employed.
