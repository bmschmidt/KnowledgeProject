AMANUS, a mountain of Syria, separating it from Cilicia; a branch of Mount Taurus (Cicero, Strabo, Pliny), extending chiefly eastward, from the sea of Cilicia to the Euphrates. It is now called Monte Negro, or rather Montagna Neres, by the inhabitants; that is, the watery mountain, as abounding in springs and rivulets.
