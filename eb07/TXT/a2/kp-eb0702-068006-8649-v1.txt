ANACALYPTERIA, according to Suidas, were presents made to the bride by her husband’s relations and friends, when she first uncovered her face and showed herself to men. These presents were also called ≡wαuλα∕α; for, among the Greeks, virgins before marriage were under strict confinement, being rarely permitted to appear'in public, or converse with the other sex; and when allowed that liberty, wore a veil over their faces, termed Kαλuwrgov, or K<zλu<τrgα, which was not left off in the presence of men till the third day after marriage; whence, according to Hesychius, this day was also called anacalypterion.
