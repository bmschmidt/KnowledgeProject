AMALTHAeUS, Jerome, John Baptista, and Corneille, three celebrated Latin poets of Italy, who flourished in the 16th century. Their compositions were printed at Amsterdam in 1685. One of the prettiest pieces in that collection is an epigram on two children, of extraordinary beauty, though each of them was deprived of an eye:
Lumine Aeon dextro, capta est Leonilla sinistro:
Et poterat forma vincere uterque Deos.
Parve puer, lumen quod habes concede sorori;
Sic tu caecus Amor, sic erit illa Venus.
