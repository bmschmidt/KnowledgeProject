ALCHEMY, that branch of chemistry which had for its principal objects the transmutation of metals into gold, 1 the panacea or universal remedy, an alkahest or universal menstruum, an universal ferment, and many other things equally ridiculous.

Kircher, instructed in all the secrets of chemistry, has fully exposed the artifices and impostures of alchemists. An alchemist puts into a crucible the matter which is to be converted into gold: this he sets on the fire, blows it, stirs it with rods, and, after divers operations, gold is found at the bottom of the crucible, instead of the matter first put in. This there are a thousand ways of effecting, without any transmutation. Sometimes it is done by dexterously dropping in a piece of gold concealed between (∣ the fingers; sometimes by casting in a little of the dust of gold or silver, disguised under the appearance of some elixir, or other indifferent matter; sometimes a crucible is used which has a double bottom, and gold put between the two; sometimes the rod used to stir the matter is hollow, and filled with the dust of the metal desired; at other times there is metal mixed with the charcoal, the ashes of the furnace, or the like. Mr Harris very properly distinguishes alchemy from chemistry, and defines the former to be ars sine arte, cujus principium est mentiri, medium laborare, et finis mendicare; and the Italians have a proverb, non tifidiare al αlchemista povero o medico ama-lαtο. The ruin which has attended this delusion has occasioned several states to make severe laws against pretences to alchemy. The Romans formerly banished all such as professed it; and the sacred canons likewise di rected the thunder of their censure against them. Dio-clesian and Caesar directed all books which treated of this subject to be burnt. Rymer furnishes us with a licence for practising alchemy, with all kinds of metals and minerals, granted to one Richard Carter in 1476. (Rym. Feed. tom. xii.) Nevertheless we have had severe laws against alchemy, and multiplying of metals, as much so as against coining itself.
