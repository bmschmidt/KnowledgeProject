AMPHORARIUM Vinum, in Antiquity, denotes that which is drawn or poured into amphorae or pitchers; by way of distinction from vinum doliare, or cask wine. The Romans had a method of keeping wine in amphorae for many years to ripen, by fastening the lids tight down with pitch or gypsum, and placing them either in a situation within reach of smoke, or under ground.
