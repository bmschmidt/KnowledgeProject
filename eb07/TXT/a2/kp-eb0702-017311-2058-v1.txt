AEOLIC, in a general sense, denotes something belonging to Aeolis.

Aeolic, or Aeolian, in Grammar, denotes one of the five dialects of the Greek tongue. It was first used in Boeotia, whence it passed into Aeolia, and was that which Sappho and Alcaeus wrote in. The Aeolic dialect generally throws out the aspirate or sharp spirit, and agrees in so many things with the Doric dialect, that the two are usually confounded together.

The Aeolic digamma is a name given to the letter F, which the Aeolians used to prefix to words beginning with [7:2:174] vowels, as F οινος for οινος ; also to insert between vowels, as ο F ις for οις. Aeolic Verse, in Prosody, a verse consisting of an iambus or spondee; then of two anapests, separated by a long syllable; ∙and, lastly, of another syllable: such as, 0 stelliferi conditor orbis. This is otherwise called eulogic verse; and, from the chief poets who used it, Archilochian and Pindaric.
