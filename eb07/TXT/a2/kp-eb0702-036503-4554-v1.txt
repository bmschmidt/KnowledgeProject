AILRED, or Ealred, abbot of Revesby, in Lincolnshire, in tlιe reigns of Stephen and Henry II. He was born in 1109, of a noble family, and educated in Scotland with Henry, the son of King David. On his return to England he became a monk of the Cistercian order in the monastery of Revesby, of which he afterwards was made abbot. He died on the 12th of January 1166, aged 57, and was buried in h⅛ monastery. “He was,” says Leland, “in great esteem during his life, celebrated for the miracles wrought after his death; and admitted into the catalogue of saints.” He was author of several works, most of which were published by Gilbo the Jesuit at Douay, 1631: part of them may be also found in the Bibliotheca Cisterciensis, and Bibliotheca Patrum. His principal work is the Speculum Clιaritatis. Leland, Bale, and Pits, mention several manuscripts which never were published.
