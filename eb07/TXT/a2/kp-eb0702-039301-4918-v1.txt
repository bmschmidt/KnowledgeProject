ALDERHOLM, an island of Sweden, formed by the three arms of a river running through Gefle, a town of Nordland, in Sweden, 80 miles north from Stockholm. Here is a wharf, a repository for planks and deals, two packing-houses, a large custom-house for taking toll of the ships, an arsenal for cannon, and a granary.
