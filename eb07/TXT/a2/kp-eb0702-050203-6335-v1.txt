ALGHERI, or AÄ¡huer, a strongly fortified city on the island of Sardinia, in the district called Capo di Sassari. It is the see of a bishop, has a cathedral, seven monasteries, and 4000 inhabitants, who speak the Catalon language, and whose chief occupation is cultivating vineyards. About a mile from the city is the fine roadstead or open bay, Porto Conte, where a fleet can anchor securely and be defended by a strong fort.
