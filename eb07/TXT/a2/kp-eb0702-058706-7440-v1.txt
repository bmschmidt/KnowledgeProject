AMAZONIA, the name of a country in South America, watered by the river Amazon, and forming part of Brazil. With respect to the Amazons said to have given name to this territory, they have been represented as governed and led to war only by their queen. No men "ere suffered to live among them; though those of some neighbouring nations were allowed to visit them at a certain season for the sake of procreation. The female children "ere bred up with care, and instructed in what relates to " ar and government; as to the males, they were sent away into the country of their fathers. But no such nation is at present to be found, any more than the giants mentioned by the first adventurers.
