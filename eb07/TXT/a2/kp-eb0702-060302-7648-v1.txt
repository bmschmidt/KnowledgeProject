AMBROSIAN Office or Rite, in Ecclesiastical History, a particular formula of worship in the church of Milan, which takes its name from St Ambrose, who instituted that office in the fourth century. Each church originally had its particular office; and when the pope, in aftertimes, took upon him to impose the Roman office upon all tlÎ¹e western churches, that of Milan sheltered itself under the name and authority of St Ambrose; from which time the Ambrosian ritual has prevailed.
