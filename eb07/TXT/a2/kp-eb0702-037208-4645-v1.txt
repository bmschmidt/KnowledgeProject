ALAM ΛGAN, one of the Ladrone or Marianne islands, in the Indian Ocean, is situated in long. 146. 47. E. lat. 18. 5. N. It is of an irregular form, and about 12 miles in circumference. The land in some places of this island is pretty high, so that it may be seen at the distance of 12 or 14 leagues. Near the north end of the island there is a volcano, which emitted an immense body [7:2:373] of smoke in the year 1799, when it was visited by Captain Bass. The volcano is in a mountain close to the sea, rising above its level 1200 or 1500 feet. The high parts of the island are rugged and sterile. In the lower parts there is a profusion and luxuriance of vegetation. They abound with cocoa-nut trees, several kinds of stone-fruit, and the mellora or bread-tree of the Nicobar islands. Some small sugar-canes, some banana trees, and one bread-fruit tree, were discovered. Lizards, land-crabs, large partridges, quails, pigeons, owls, thrushes, and bullfinches, are numerous. But no fresh water, which was the object of Captain Bass’s visit, could be found.
