AGUSADURA, in ancient customs, a fee due from vassals to their lord for the sharpening of their ploughing tackle. Anciently the tenants in some manors were not allowed to have their rural implements sharpened by any but whom the lord appointed, for which an acknowledgement was to be paid, called agusadura, in some places agusage ; which some take to be the same with what was otherwise called reillage, from the ancient French rÎ±lk, a ploughshare.
