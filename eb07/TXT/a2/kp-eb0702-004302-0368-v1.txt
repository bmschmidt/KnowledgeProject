ABROGATION, the act of abolishing a law, by authority of the maker; in which sense the word is synonymous with abolition, repealing, and revocation.

Abrogation stands opposed to rogation; it is distinguished from derogation, which implies the taking away only some part of a law; from subrogation, which denotes the adding a clause to it; from abrogation, which implies the limiting or restraining it; from dispensation, which only sets it aside in a particular instance; and from antiquation, which is the refusing to pass a law.
