AGANIPPE, in Antiquity, a fountain of Boeotia, at Mount Helicon, on the borders between Phocis and Boeotia, sacred to the Muses, and running into the river Permessus. Ovid seems to make Aganippe and Hippocrene the same. Serenus more truly distinguishes them, and ascribes the blending of them to poetical licence.
