VORALBERG, a circle of the Austrian province of Tyrol, which touches on the lake of Constance. This locality renders it of some importance to the imperial dominions. It extends over 1628 square miles, and comprehends three cities, seven market towns, and 412 villages, with 79,600 inhabitants. It is a mountainous and highly picturesque district, yielding little besides Alpine pasture for cattle. The capital is the city of Bregentz, built on a hill overlooking the lake of Constance.
