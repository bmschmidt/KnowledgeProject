VEERE, or Ter Veere, or by the English Campvere. This is a fortified town of the province of Brabant, and the kingdom of the Netherlands. It stands on the north side of the island of Walcheren, on a narrow channel near the mouth of the Scheldt, where two arms of that river meet. It has a fine arsenal, a handsome town-hall, and two churches. It was formerly the staple-town for the trade between Scotland and Holland; but its privileges, and much of its commerce, have been removed to Rotterdam. It has some large handsome dwelling-houses, but now not more than 1750 inhabitants.
