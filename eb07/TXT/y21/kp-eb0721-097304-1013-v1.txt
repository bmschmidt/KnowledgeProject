YU, two rivers of China; one rises in Honan, twelve miles north of Pi-yang, and joins the Hoai, twenty miles east-south-east of Sin-tsai. The other rises about twenty-six miles west from Ngan-fou, in Kiang-see, and runs into the Kan-kiang, seven miles north-north-east of Lin-kiang. It is also the name of several cities of the second rank.
