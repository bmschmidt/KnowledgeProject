PISCINA, in Antiquity, a large basin in a public place or square, where the Roman youth learned to swim, and which was surrounded with a high wall, to prevent filth from being thrown into it. This word is also used for a lavatory amongst the Turks, placed in the middle court of a mosque or temple, where the Mussulmans wash themselves before they offer their prayers.
