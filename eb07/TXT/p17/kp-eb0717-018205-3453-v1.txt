PELOPS, in fabulous history, the son of Tantalus, king of Phrygia, went into Elis, where he married Hippodamia the daughter of CEnomaus, king of that country, and became so powerful, that all the territory which lies beyond the isthmus, and composes a considerable part of Greece, was called Peloponnesus, from his name Pelops, and the Greek word νησος, an island.
