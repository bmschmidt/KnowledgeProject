PASTOPHORI, amongst the ancients, were priests whose office it was to carry the images, along with the shrines, of the gods, at solemn festivals, when they prayed to them for rain, fair weather, or the like. In Syllaâ€™s time, the Greeks had a college of this order of priests. The cells or apartments near the temples, where the pastophori lived, were called pastophoria ; and there were several lodging rooms for the priests of a similar kind in the temple of Jerusalem.
