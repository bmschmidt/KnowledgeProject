PHARAMOND is the name given by the generality of historians to the first king of France. He is said to have reigned at Treves, and over a part of France, about the year 420, and to have been succeeded by his son Clodion; but the account which is given of these two princes is very-uncertain. It is probable that Pharamond was no more than a general of an army, or the head of a military society of Franks, who were masters of their persons and their fortunes. Gregory of Tours, the author of a curious history of the Franks, appears to have entertained this opinion.
