PHIDITIA, in Grecian antiquity, feasts celebrated with great frugality at Sparta. They were held in the public places and in the open air. Rich and poor assisted at them equally, and upon the same footing; their design being to keep up peace, friendship, good understanding, and equality amongst the citizens, great and small. It is said that those who attended this feast brought each a bushel of flour, eight measures of wine, five pounds of cheese, and two pounds and a half of figs, with some money.
