This distinguished virtue, like many others, received amongst the Romans divine honours, and was made one of their gods. Acilius Glabrio first erected a temple to this divinity, which he built upon the spot on which a woman had fed with her own milk her aged father, who had been imprisoned by order of the senate, and deprived of all aliments.
