PLAN, in general, denotes the representation of something drawn upon a plane, such as maps, charts, ichnographies, and the like. The term plan, however, is particularly used for a draught of a building, such as it appears, or is intended to appear, on the ground, showing the extent, division, and distribution of its area or ground-plot into apartments, rooms, passages, &c. A geometrical plan is that in which the solid and vacant parts are represented in their natural proportions. The raised plan of a building is the same with what is otherwise called an elevation or orthography. A perspective plan is that exhibited by degradations or diminutions, according to the rules of perspective.
