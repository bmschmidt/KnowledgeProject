PELOPIA, a festival observed by the Eleans in honour of Pelops. A ram was sacrificed on the occasion; but priests and people were both prohibited from partaking of it, on pain of excommunication from Jupiter’á temple; the neck only being allotted to the officer who provided wood for the sacrifice. This officer was called Sυ∙ λιυς ; and white poplar was the only wood made use of at this solemnity.
