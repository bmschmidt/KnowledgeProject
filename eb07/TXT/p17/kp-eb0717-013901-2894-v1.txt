PATMOS, a small island of the Grecian Archipelago, celebrated as the place of banishment of the apostle St John, and where also he wrote his Revelations. It is situated a little to the south of Samos, on the coast of Asia Minor, is between thirty and forty miles in circumference, and now scarcely produces subsistence for the support of its scanty population. It is represented as having been more productive about fifty years back, but has been cruelly laid waste by the pirates who infest these seas. It does not now contain more than 300 inhabitants. In the interior are the remains of a monastery, in a strong position, where formerly the natives were accustomed to take refuge and defend themselves against piratical invaders. Long. 26. 40. E. Lat. 37. 30. N.
