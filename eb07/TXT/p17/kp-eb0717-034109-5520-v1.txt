PHARSALIA, in Ancient Geography, a town of the Phthiotes, a district of Thessaly, near Pherae and Larissa. To this last place Pompey fled from the plains of Pharsalus; it is watered by the river Enipeus, which falls into the Apidamus, and both together unite with the Peneus. Between Pharsalia and Enipeus Pompey drew up his men at the decisive battle of Pharsalia. See Rome.
