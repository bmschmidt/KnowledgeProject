PETROJOANNITES were followers of Peter John, or Peter Joannis, that is, Peter the son of John, who flourished in the twelfth century. His doctrine was not known until after his death, when his body was taken out of his grave and burned. His opinions were, that he alone had the knowledge of the true sense in which the apostles preached the gospel; that the reasonable soul is not the form of man; that there is no grace infused by baptism; and that Jesus Christ was pierced with a lance on the cross before he expired.
