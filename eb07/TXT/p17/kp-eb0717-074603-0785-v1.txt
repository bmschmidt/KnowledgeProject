PINEDA, John, an historian of some note, was descended of a noble family, and born at Seville. He entered into the society of the Jesuits in 1572, and taught philosophy and divinity in several collcgcs, but devoted his time chiefly to the study of the Holy Scriptures. That he might render this study the more easy, he made himself master of the oriental languages. Of his writings we have, 1. Commentaries upon the book of Job, two vols, in folio; 2. Commentaries upon Ecclesiastes; 3. A general History of the Church, in Spanish, four vols, in folio; and, 4. A History of Ferdinand III. in the same language, in folio. He died in 1637, much regretted by the members of his society, and by the public in general.
