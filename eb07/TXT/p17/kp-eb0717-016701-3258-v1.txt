PEBAS, a district of Peru, in South America, situated upon the left bank of the river Mara√±on, to the east of the confluence of the Ucayale with that river. It produces cocoa, sarsaparilla, vanilla, white and black bees-wax, maize, yucas, plantains, camotas, and papayas, and some dye-stuffs of a peculiar description. The river here supplies vaca marina, tartaruga, gavitanas, sungarros, and pacos. In the woods there are tigers, tapirs, deer, roonsookas, and black and white monkeys. The pueblo or town of Pebas is situated on a height, upon an elevated part of the bank of the river. It is built without any regard to regularity, and is chiefly inhabited by Indians, who are a cheerful and industrious race of people.
