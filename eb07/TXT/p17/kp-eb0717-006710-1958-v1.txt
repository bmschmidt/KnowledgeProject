PARASITE, amongst the Greeks, was originally a very reputable title, the parasites being a kind of priests, or at least ministers, of the gods, in the same manner as the epulones were at Rome. They took care of the sacred corn, or the corn destined for the service of the temples and the gods, viz. sacrifices and feasts; and they had even the superintendence of sacrifices, taking care that these were duly performed. At Athens there was a kind of college of twelve parasites; each tribe of Attica furnishing one, who was always chosen out of the best families. Polybius adds, that a parasite was also an honourable title amongst the ancient Gauls, and was given to their poets. But it has [7:17:68] degenerated into a term of reproach, and is now used to signify a flatterer, sycophant, or mean dependent.
