PASSADE, in the man√®ge, is a turn or course of a horse backwards or forwards on the same spot of ground. Hence there are several sorts of passades, according to the different ways of turning, in order to part or return upon the same tread, which is called closing the passade; as the passade of one time, the passade of five times, and the raised or high passades.
