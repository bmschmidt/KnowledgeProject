PAREENUGGUR, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Cutch, and district of Parkur. It was formerly a place of great consequence, and celebrated for its temples, which were dedicated to Buddha. It now contains only 300 [7:17:70] houses, chiefly inhabited by Sodah Rajpoots; its ancient inhabitants having long ago left it, on account of the turbulent state of the country, and migrated for safety to Noanagur and other places. The town is not fortified; and when it is attacked, the inhabitants fly for refuge to a neighbouring mountain, which is represented as rising to a great elevation. During the era of its prosperity, which was at a remote period, it was inhabited by numerous families of Banyans, whose temples were famous for elegance and sanctity, and were resorted to from every quarter for the purposes of devotion. The idol of stone, Goreecha, was an object of adoration to multitudes, who resorted thither from all quarters.
