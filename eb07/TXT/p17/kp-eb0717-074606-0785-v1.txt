PINET, Antony du, an ecclesiastical writer, who lived in the sixteenth century, and was a native of Besançon, in France. He was strongly attached to the Protestant religion, and a bitter enemy to the church of Rome. His book, entitled La Conformité des Eglises Reformées de France et de ΓEglise Primitive, printed at Lyons, 1564, in 8vo, and the notes which he added to the French translation of the Fees of the Pope’s Chancery, which was printed at Lyons in 8vo, 1564, and reprinted at Amsterdam in 1700, in 12mo, plainly discover his sentiments. The last-mentioned work he published under the title of La Boutique du Pape, in Latin and French, with some notes taken from decrees, councils, and canons, in order to ascertain the discipline anciently observed in the church. In the epistle dedicatory he assumes the tone of a declared enemy of the court of Rome. FI is translation of Pliny’s Natural History, printed at Lyons in two vols, folio, 1566, and at Paris, 1608, was formerly much read. Though it contains many errors, it is nevertheless very useful, especially for those who do not understand the Latin, on account of the translator’s researches, and a great number of marginal notes. Pinet also published at Lyons, 1564, in folio, Plans of the principal Fortresses in the World.
