PITISCUS, Samuel, a learned philologist, was born at Zutphen, in Dutch Gueldres, and became rector of the college of that city, and afterwards of St Jerome at Utrecht, where he died on the 1st of February 1717, at the age of ninety. He wrote, 1. Lexicon Latino-Belgicum, 1704, in 4to; 2. Lexicon Antiquitatum Romanarum, in quo ritus et antiquitates, tum Graecis et Romanis communes, tum Romanis particulares exponuntur, Leeuwarden, 1713, in two vols, folio; and he published good editions, with prefaces and notes, of Quintus Curtius, Polyhistor, Solinus, with the Observations of Salmasius on Pliny, Suetonius, Aurelius Victor, the Pantheon Mythicum, and the Antiquitates Pomanae of Rosini. In 1685, Pitiscus announced a Lexicon Cdtullo-Tibullo-Propertianum ; but this work, which his friends regarded as a mine of erudition, never appeared.
