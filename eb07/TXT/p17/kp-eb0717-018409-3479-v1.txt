PENDANT, an ornament hanging at the ear, and frequently composed of diamonds, pearls, or other jewels.

Pendants, in Heraldry, parts hanging down from the label to the number of three, four, five, or six at most, resembling the drops in the Doric frize. When they are more than three, they must be specified in blazoning.

PENDANTS of a Ship are those streamers, or long colours, which are split and divided into two parts, ending in points, and suspended at the heads of masts, or at the yard-arm ends.
