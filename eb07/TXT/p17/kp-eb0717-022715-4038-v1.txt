PERCEPTION is a word so well understood that it is difficult for the lexicographer to define it. It has been called the first and most simple act of the mind, by which it becomes conscious of its own ideas. This definition, however, is improper, as it confounds perception with consciousness; although the objects of the former faculty are things without us, and those of the latter the energies of our own minds. Perception is that power or faculty by which, through the medium of the senses, we become cognizant of objects distinct and separate from ourselves, and learn that we are but a small part in the system of nature. See Metaphysics.
