PIETRA Mala, a market-town of Italy, in the vicariate of Firenzuolo, and the grand duchy of Tuscany. It stands on the great road from Florence to Bologna, twenty-four miles to the north-west of the former city. It is remarkable from its vicinity, to the mountain Raticosa, from which there issues constantly, on some parts of its surface, a flame, which does not produce those effects that commonly arise from volcanic eruptions. It burns both clear and bright, rises several feet above the earth, and is visible at a considerable distance. Various opinions and conjectures have been formed by naturalists concerning the causes and nature of this phenomenon, but none has been considered as satisfactory.
