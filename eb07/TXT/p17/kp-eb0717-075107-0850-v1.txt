PISSELAeUM Indicum, Barbadoes Tar, a mineral fluid of the nature of the thicker bitumens, and of all others that which most approaches, in appearance, colour, and consistence, to the true pissasphaltum, though it differs from it in other respects. It frequently occurs in many parts of America, where it is found trickling down the sides of mountains in large quantities, and sometimes floating on the surface of the waters. It has been greatly recommended internally in coughs and other disorders of the breast and lungs.
