PIZARRO, Francis, a celebrated Spanish general, the discoverer and conqueror of Peru, in conjunction with Diego Almagro, a famous Spanish navigator. They are both charged with having committed horrid cruelties on the inhabitants; and they fell victims to their own ambition, jealousy, and avarice. Almagro having revolted, was defeated and beheaded by Pizarro, who again was assassinated by Almagroâ€™s friends in 1541. See the article Peru.
