PERIRPHANTERIUM, a vessel of stone or brass fill ed with holy water, with which all those were sprinkled who were admitted by the ancients to their sacrifices. Beyond this vessel no profane person was allowed to pass. We are told by some that it was placed in the adytum, or inmost recess of the temple; but others say that it was placed at the door, which indeed seems to be the most probable opinion. It was used both by Greeks and Romans, and has been evidently borrowed, like many other Pagan ceremonies, by the Church of Rome. The Hebrews had also a vessel for purification.
