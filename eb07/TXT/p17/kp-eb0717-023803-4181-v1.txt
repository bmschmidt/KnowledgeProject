PERONES, a sort of high shoes, which were worn not only by country people, but also by men of ordinary rank at Rome. In the early times of the commonwealth, they were worn even by senators; but at last they were disused by persons of note, and confined to ploughmen and labourers. They were very rudely formed, consisting of hides undressed, and reached only to the middle of the leg. Virgil mentions the perones as worn by a company of rustic soldiers on one foot only.
