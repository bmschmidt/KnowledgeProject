PHARMACI were two persons employed in the lustration or purification of cities. Some say that they were both men; but others maintain, that a man to represent the males, and a woman to represent the females, performed this office. They offered sacrifice, and wore figs about their necks; those of the men being blackish, and those of the women white. Figs were an emblem of fertility, which they doubtless prayed for on these solemn occasions.
