PIPERS, a musical term, now applied to performers on the bagpipe. Thus we have Northumbrian pipers, Irish pipers, Calabrian pipers, Scottish pipers, &c. The bagpipe seems to be one of the most ancient of musical instruments. It had various names in ancient times and in different countries. Boccacio introduces it as a fashionable instrument in his Decameron; and, from the accounts of the household expenses of our British monarchs, we find that the bagpiper was a court-musician in the olden time. In Struttâ€™s Sports and Pastimes of the People of England, we find a bagpipe player on stilts, from an illuminated [7:17:749] manuscript of the thirteenth century, in the reign of Henry HI.; and another bagpiper of the same century, with a girl dancing upon his shoulders. Some of the most curious representations of bagpipers and their instruments (chori or corti) are given by Gerbert De Cantu et Musica Sacra, plates thirty-three and thirty-four of the second volume.
