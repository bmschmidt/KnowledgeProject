PATROS, mentioned by Jeremiah and Ezekiel, appears from the context to mean a part of Egypt. BocclÎ¹art thinks it denotes Upper Egypt; the Septuagint translate it the country of Pathure ; Pliny speaks of the Nomos Pathwrites in the Thebais; and Ptolemy mentions Pathyris i which was probably the metropolis. From the Hebrew appellation Patros comes the gentilitious name Pathrusim.
