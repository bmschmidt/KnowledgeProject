HYGIEINE, 'Ty∕s∕vjj, formed from bγιτ i ς, sound or healthy, that branch of medicine which relates to health, and discovers proper means for the preservation of that state.

Hygieine, more largely taken, is divided into three parts: prophyladice, which foresees and prevents diseases; synteritice, which is employed in preserving health; and analeptice, which relates to the cure of diseases, and the restoration of health.
