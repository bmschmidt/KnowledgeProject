HYDROGRAPHY, the art of measuring and describing the sea, rivers, canals, lakes, and the like. With regard to the sea, it gives an account of its tides, countertides, soundings, bays, gulfs, creeks, as also of the rocks, shelves, sands, shallows, promontories, and harbours; the distance and bearing of one port from another; with every thing that is remarkable, whether out at sea or on the coast.
