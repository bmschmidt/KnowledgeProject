HYPOCAUSTUM, amongst the Greeks and Romans, a subterraneous place, where there was a furnace to heat the baths. The word is Greek, formed from the preposition ĩ>¶o, under, and the verb κα∕ω, to bum. Amongst the moderns, the hypocaustum is that place where the fire is kept which warms a stove or hot-house.
