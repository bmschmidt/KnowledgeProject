MAGAZINE, a place in which stores are kept, of arms, ammunition, provisions, and the like.

Powder Magazine is that place where gunpowder is kept in large quantities. The first powder magazines were made with Gothic arches; but Vauban finding them too weak, constructed them in a semicircular form. Their usual dimensions are sixty feet long within, and twenty-five broad; the foundations are eight or nine feet thick, and eight feet high from the foundation to the spring of the arch; and the floor is two feet from the ground, which secures it from dampness.

Artillery Magazine. In a siege, the magazine is made [7:13:678] about twenty-five or thirty yards behind the battery, towards the parallels, and at least three feet under ground, to contain the powder, loaded shells, portfires, and the like.

Magazine, on shipboard, a close room or storehouse, built in the fore or after part of the hold, to contain the gunpowder used in battle. This apartment is strongly secured against fire, and no person is allowed to enter it with a lamp or candle; it is therefore lighted, as occasion requires, by means of the candles or lamps in the light-room contiguous to it.

Magazine, Literary, a well-known species of periodical publications. One of the first that appeared was The Gentlemans Magazine, set on foot by Mr Edward Cave, in the year 1731. This, as Dr Kippis observes,^[1. Biοgrαghiα Britannica, vol. iii. art. Cave.] “may be considered as something of an epocha in the literary history of this country. The periodical performances before that time were almost wholly confined to political transactions, and to foreign and domestic occurrences; but the monthly magazines have opened a way for every kind of inquiry and information. The intelligence and discussion contained in them arc very extensive and various; and they have been the means of diffusing a general habit of reading through the nation, which, in a certain degree, hath enlarged the public understanding. Many young authors, who have afterwards risen to considerable eminence in the literary world, have here made their first attempts in composition. Here too are preserved a multitude of curious and useful hints, observations, and facts, which otherwise might have never appeared; or, if they had appeared in a more evanescent form, would have incurred the danger of being lost.”
