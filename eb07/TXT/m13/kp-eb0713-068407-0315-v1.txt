MAGNANIMITY denotes greatness of mind, particularly in circumstances of trial and adversity. It has been justly observed, that it is pride in the good sense, and the noblest way of acquiring applause. It renders the soul superior to the trouble, disorder, and emotion, which the appearance of great danger might excite; and it is by this quality that heroes maintain their tranquillity, and preserve the free use of their reason, amidst the most dreadful accidents. It admires the same quality even in an enemy; and fame, glory, conquests, desire of opportunities to pardon and oblige their opponents, are the emotions which glow in the minds of the brave.
