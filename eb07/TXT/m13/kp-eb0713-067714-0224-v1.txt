MAGAS, Magadis (from μaγah^uv, to sing or play in unison), the name of a musical instrument in use amongst the ancients. There were two kinds of magades, the one a stringed instrument, formed of twenty chords arranged in pairs, and tuned to unison, so that they yielded ten sounds; the invention of which is ascribed by some to Sappho, by others to the Lydians, and by others to Timotheus of Miletus. The other was a kind of flute, which at the same time yielded very high and very low notes. The former kind was much improved by Timotheus of Miletus, who is said to have been impeached of a crime, because, by increasing the number of chords, he spoiled and discredited the ancient music.
