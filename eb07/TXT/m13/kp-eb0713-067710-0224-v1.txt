MAFFAeUS, Vegio, a Latin poet, born in Lombardy in 1407, was greatly admired in his time. He wrote epigrams, and a humorous supplement to Virgil, which he called the thirteenth book of the Aeneid, and which has been translated into English by Mr Ellis. Maffaeusalso wrote some prose works. He was chancellor of Rome towards the end of the pontificate of Martin V., and died in 1458.
