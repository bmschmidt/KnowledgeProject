MAGNESIA, a town of Asia Minor, situated on the Maeander, about fifteen miles from Ephesus. Themistocles died at Magnesia, which was one of the three towns given him by Artaxerxes, “to furnish his table with bread.” It is also celebrated for a battle which was fought there, 190 years before the Christian era, between the Romans and Antiochus king of Syria. It was founded by a colony from Magnesia in Thessaly; and was commonly called Magnesia adMoeandrum, to distinguish it from another called Magnesia ad Sipylum, in Lydia, at the foot of Mount Sipylus.
