LUCARIA, a feast celebrated at Rome on the 18th of July, in memory of the flight of the Romans into a great wood, where they found an asylum, and saved themselves from destruction. This wood, in which they found protection, was situated between the Tiber and the Via Salaria. The enemies from whom the Romans fled were the Gauls. On this festival Plutarch tells us that it was customary to pay the actors, and such as contributed to the public amusement, with the money arising from the felling of wood; and this money was called lucar. It is obvious, from what has been observed, that lucar and lucaria are derived from lucus, a grove.
