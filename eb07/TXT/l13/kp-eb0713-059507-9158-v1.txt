LUNETTE, in Fortification, an enveloped counterguard, or elevation of earth, made beyond the second ditch, opposite to the places of arms, and differing from the ravelins only in situation. Lunettes are usually made in ditches full of water, and serve the same purpose as fausse-brayes, namely, to dispute the passage of the ditch. Lu-nettons are small lunettes.

Lunette, in the manege, is a half horse-shoe, or such a shoe as wants the sponge, that is, the part of the branch which runs towards the quarters of the foot.

Lunette is also the name of two small pieces of felt, made round and hollow, to clap upon the eyes of a vicious horse, that is apt to bite, and strike with his fore feet, or that will not suffer his rider to mount.
