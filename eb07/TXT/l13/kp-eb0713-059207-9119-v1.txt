LUDGERSHALL, a market and borough town of the county of Wilts, in the hundred of Amesbury, seventy miles from London and fifteen from Salisbury. It is pleasantly situated on the borders of the forest of Chute. It formerly returned two members to the House of Commons, but has been deprived of that privilege by the reform act. The population amounted in 1801 to 471, in 1811 to 487, in 1821 to 477, and in 1831 to 535.
