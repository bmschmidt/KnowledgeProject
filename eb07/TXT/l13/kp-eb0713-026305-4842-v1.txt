LEVITE, in a general sense, means all the descendants ot Levi, amongst whom were the Jewish priests themselves, who, being descended from Aaron, were likewise of the race of Levi. In a more particular sense, Levite is used to signify an order of officers in that church, who were employed in performing the manual service of the temple. They were obedient to the priests in their ministration, and brought them wood, water, and other necessaries for the sacrifice. They sung and played upon instruments in the temple and in other places. They applied themselves to the study of the law, and were the ordinary judges of the country, but always subordinate to the priests. Their subsistence consisted of the tithes of corn, fruit, and cattle, throughout Israel; but the priests were entitled to a tenth of their tithes, by way of first fruits to the Lord. Forty-eight cities were assigned for the residence of the Levites, of which the priests claimed thirteen, six being chosen as cities of refuge. They were consecrated, before they entered upon their ministry, by shaving their flesh, washing their clothes, and sprinkling with the water of expiation. Imposition of hands was used in consecration, and two bullocks were offered at the door of the tabernacle. They waited weekly, and by turns, in the temple, beginning their attendance on one sabbath and ending the next, during which time they were maintained out of the offerings. In the time of Solomon, the number of Levites, from the age of twenty, and capable of serving, was thirty thousand.
