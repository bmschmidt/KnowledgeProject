LULLY, Raymond, a writer on alchemy, surnamed the Enlightened Doctor, was born in the island of Majorca in 1225. He applied himself with indefatigable labour to the study of the Arabian philosophy, chemistry, physic, and divinity, and acquired great reputation by his works. He at length went to preach the gospel in Africa, and was stoned to death in Mauritania, at the age of eighty. He is honoured as a martyr at Majorca, whither his body was carried. He wrote many treatises on the sciences, in which he shows much study and subtilty, but little judgment or solidity. A complete edition of his works was printed at Mentz. This person must not be confounded with Raymond Lully of Terraca, surnamed NeophytÎ±, who, from being a Jew, turned Dominican friar, and maintained several opinions which were condemned by Gregory XI.
