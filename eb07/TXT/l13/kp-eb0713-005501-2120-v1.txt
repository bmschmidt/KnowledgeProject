LANCEROTA, one of the Cąpary Islands, situated at some distance from the western shore of Africa. It is subject to volcanoes; and one which occurred in 1730, spread desolation over a highly· cultivated region, entirely changing the face of the island. The eastern part is fertile, though sandy; and, stripped of its forests, Lancerota experiences, like the neighbouring continent, most excessive droughts. Camels are nevertheless maintained in great numbers; and corn, barley, and vegetables are exported. The vine grows with strength amongst the volcanic ashes. Teguisa is the name of the capital. This island possesses the two best ports of the archipelago; and it is much more advanced in civilization than those situated farther to the westward. The inhabitants lived in houses built of freestone, at a time when the Guanches of Teneriffe were lodged in caverns. Here is practised the singular custom likewise found in Thibet, of one woman being allowed to possess several husbands. The inhabitants of Lancerota may amount to about 10,000 in number, who export some corn, and a large quantity of dried goats’ flesh; but they do not exhibit the commercial activity of those of Teneriffe. The island is about thirty miles in length by eighty in breadth.
