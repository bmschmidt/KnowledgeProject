LUBIENIETSKI, Stanislaus, a Polish gentleman, descended from a noble family, and born at Cracow in the year 1623, was educated by his father with great attention. He became a celebrated Socinian minister, and took great pains to obtain a toleration from the German princes for his Sâˆ©cinian brethren. His labours, however, were ineffectual, and he was himself persecuted by the Lutheran ministers, and driven from place to place, until at length he was, along with his two daughters, banished out of the world by poison, his wife narrowly escaping, in 1675. He wrote a History of the Reformation in Poland, a Treatise on Comets, and some other works, in Latin.
