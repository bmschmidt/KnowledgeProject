LOTION is, strictly speaking, such washing as concerns beautifying the skin, by cleansing it of those deformities which are thrown out upon it by distempered blood.

Lotion, in Pharmacy, denotes a preparation of medicines, by washing them in some liquid, either made very light, so as to take away only the dregs, or sharp, so as to penetrate them, in order to clear them of some salt or corrosive spirit, as is done to antimony, precipitates, ma-gisteries, and the like, or intended to take away some foulness or ill quality, and communicate some good one.
