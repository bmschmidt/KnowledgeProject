LYCON, a philosopher of the school of Aristotle, was a native of Loadicea, in Phrygia. He was born b. c. 300, and died, at the age of seventy-four, b. c. 226. Upon the death of Strato, Lycon became the head of the Aristotelian sect (b. c. 270), and taught the school at Athens which had been conducted successively by Aristotle, Theophrastus, and Strato, whom he succeeded. We are informed by Diogenes Laertius, in his life of this philosopher, that he was particularly successful in directing the studies of youth; and that he regarded corporal punishment as not only useless, but positively injurious, holding, that youth ought to be directed by feelings of honour and shame, as a horse is by the spur and reins. His eloquence was full of mild persuasion, and so melodious, that his contemporaries prefixed the letter G to his name, making it Glycon, which signifies sweetness. He was much esteemed by Attalus and Eumenes I. kings of Pergamus; and Antiochus, king of Syria, did every thing in his power to prevail on him to remain at his court. He conducted the school with great ability during upwards of forty-two years, and was succeeded by Aristo Ceus (Plut. Mor. p. 605, b.). The last will of Lycon is given by Diogenes, and exhibits a strong proof of the kindness and goodness of his nature.
