LASH, or Lace, in nautical language, signifies to bind or make fast; as, to lash the bonnet to the course, or the drabbler to the bonnets. The carpenter takes care that the spare yards are lashed fast to the shipâ€™s side; and in a rolling sea, the gunners mind that the guns are well lashed, lest they should break loose. Lashers are properly those ropes which bind fast the tackles and the breechings of the ordnance, when hauled or made fast within board.
