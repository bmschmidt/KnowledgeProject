LINT. See Flax and Linen. Lint, in Surgery, is the scrapings of fine linen, used by surgeons in dressing wounds. It is made into various forms, which acquire different names according to the difference of the figures. Lint made up in an oval or orbicular form is called a pledgit ; if in a cylindrical form, or in the shape of a date, or olive-stone, it is called a dossil.
