LOKMAN the Wise, an eminent philosopher amongst the orientals. The Arabians say he was the son of Baura, the son or grandson of a sister or aunt of Job. He was an Ethiopian, and for some time a slave. It is related that he was born in the time of David, and that he lived till the age of the prophet Jonah. Some suppose him to have been the same with Aesop the mythologist; and indeed we find in the parables or apologues of Lokman in Arabie many particulars which are seen in Aesop’s fables, so that it is not easy to determine whether the Greek or the Arabian are the originals. He is said to have been deformed in his person; but this defect was sufficiently compensated by the perfections of his mind. Some pieees of his are extant; and he was looked upon as so excellent a person, that Mahommed has inserted a chapter in the Koran called after his name, in which he introduces God as saying, “We heretofore bestowed wisdom on Lokman.” It is related that he obtained his liberty upon the following occasion. His master having given him a bitter melon to eat, he ate it all. Surprised at his exact obedience, his master asked him, How it was possible for him to eat such a nauseous fruit? He answered, “I have received so many favours from you, that it is no wonder I should once in my life eat a bitter melon from your hand.” This generous answer of the slave struek the master to such a degree, that he immediately gave him his liberty. A French translation of the fables of Lokman, and of Bidpai or Pilpay, a Brahminieal philosopher, by M. - Galland, was published at Paris in 1724.
