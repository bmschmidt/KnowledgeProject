LIBANIUS, a Greek rhetorician and sophist in the fourth century, was born at Antioch, and shared the friendship of Julian the Apostate. That prince offered him the dignity of profectus proetorio ; but Libanius refused it, thinking the name of sophist, or professor of eloquence, much more honourable. There are still extant several of his letters and Greek orations, by which he acquired great reputation; but his style is somewhat affected and obscure.Â· St Basil and St Chrysostom were his disciples about the vear 360. His letters were published at Amsterdam in 1738, and his Orations at Venice in the year 1755. Libanius was a pagan.
