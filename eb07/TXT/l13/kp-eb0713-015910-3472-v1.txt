LECTICA was a litter or vehicle in which the Romans were carried. It was of two kinds, covered and uncovered. The covered lectica is called by Pliny cubiculum viatorum, a travellerâ€™s bed-chamber. And indeed we are informed that Augustus frequently ordered his servants to stop his litter that he might sleep upon the road. This vehicle was carried by six or eight men called lecticarii. The lectica differed from the sella in this, that in the one the traveller could recline himself for sleep, whereas in the other he was obliged to sit. The lectica was invented in Bithynia; the sella was a Roman machine, and esteemed the more honourable of the two. Lectica was also the name of the funeral bed or bier for carrying out the dead.
