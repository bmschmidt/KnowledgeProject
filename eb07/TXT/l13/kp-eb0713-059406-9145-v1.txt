LULLI, Jean Baptiste, one of the most celebrated musicians that has appeared in France since the revival of learning, was born at Florence. He was taken to France when very young, by a person of quality; and he carried the art of playing on the violin to the highest perfection. Louis XIV. appointed him superintendent of music. Some time afterwards, Perinna having introduced operas into France, and quarrelled with his company, he resigned his privilege to Lulli. Operas were then carried to the utmost perfection by this celebrated musician, and were at tended with continual applause. From this time, Lulli every year produced a piece of his own composition, until his death, which happened in the year 1687.
