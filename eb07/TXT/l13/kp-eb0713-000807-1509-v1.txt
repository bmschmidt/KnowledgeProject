LACHISH, in Ancient Geography, a city to the southward of the tribe of Judah. Eusebius and St Jerome inform us, that in their time there was a village called Lachish, seven miles southward from Eleutheropolis. Sennacherib besieged Lachish, but did not take it; after which he sent Rabshakeh against Jerusalem. It was at Lachish that King Amaziah was slain by his rebel subjects.
