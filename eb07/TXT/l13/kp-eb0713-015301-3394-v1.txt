LAWLESS Court, a court said to have been held annually on the Kingâ€™s Hill at Rochford, in Essex, on the Wednesday morning after Michaelmas day, at cock-crowing, where they whispered, and had no candle, nor any pen and ink, but only a coal. Persons who owed suit or service, and did not appear, forfeited double their rent every hour they were missing. This servile attendance, Camden informs us, was imposed on the tenants for conspiring at the like unseasonable hour to raise a commotion. The court belonged to the honour of Raleigh, and to the Earl of Warwick, and was called lawless, from its being held at an unlawful hour.

Lawn, in manufactures, a fine sort of linen, remarkable for being used in the sleeves of the clerical dress of bishops.
