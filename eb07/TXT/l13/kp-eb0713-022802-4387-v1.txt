LEMURIA, or Lemuralia, afcast solemnized at Rome on the 9th of May, to pacify the manes of the dead, or in honour of the lemures. It was instituted by Romulus to appease the ghost of his murdered brother Remus, which he thought was continually pursuing him to revenge the crime. Sacrifices continued for three nights, the temples were shut up, and marriages were prohibited during the solemnity. A variety of whimsical ceremonies were performed, and the ghosts were desired to withdraw, without endeavouring to hurt or affright their friends above ground. The chief formalities were ablution, putting black beans into their mouths, and beating kettles and pans, to make the goblins keep at a respectful distance.
