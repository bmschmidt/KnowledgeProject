LYMINGTON, a market and borough town of the county of Hants, in the parish of Boldre, in the New Forest. It stands on a creek about half a mile from the sea. It is pleasantly situated on the brow and declivity of a gentle hill, looking towards the Isle of Wight; and many of the houses are highly respectable in appearance. It has been lately frequented, by visitors for the purpose of sea-bathing. It is a corporation, and returns, as before the recent law, two members to parliament; but other places in the vicinity are added to make up the proper constituency. The population amounted in 1801 to 2378, in 1811 to 2641, in 1821 to 3164, and in 1831 to 3361.
