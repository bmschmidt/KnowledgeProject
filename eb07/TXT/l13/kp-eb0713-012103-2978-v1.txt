LAUENBURG, a duchy in Germany, formerly a part of Hanover, but at the congress of Vienna transferred to Denmark. It extends in longitude from 9. 56. to 10. 37. E. and in latitude from 53. 21. to 53. 48. N., and contains 443 square miles, with one city, one town, and 123 villages, with 34,650 inhabitants. It borders on the Elbe, where there are some rich meadows; but the greater part of the duchy is a poor and sandy soil, yielding little grain excepting rye. There are some extensive woods in the western parts, which afford good oak and beech timber. There are few even of domestic manufactures beyond the spinning of flax, and very little commerce of any kind; and the roads are in the present day by far the worst which are to be met with in Germany. The capital is a city of the same name, situated on the river Elbe, where the Stecnitz falls into that stream. It is an ancient town, with pleasant walks on the side of the smaller river, and contains 460 houses, with 2980 inhabitants. It was built in the year 1157, by Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, and was the residence of a member of that family till 1697. The church contains many monuments of that race, and has a lofty tower visible over a large circle. Long. 10. 17. 10. Ä½. Lat. 53. 21. 5. N.
