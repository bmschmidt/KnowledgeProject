LUSTRAL, an epithet given by the ancients to the water used in their ceremonies for sprinkling and purifying the people. From them the Catholics have borrowed the holy water used in their churches.

Lustral Day {Dies Lustricus), that on which the lustrations were performed for a child, and its name given, which was usually the ninth day after the birth of a boy, and the eighth after that of a girl; though some performed the ceremony on the last day of the week in which the child was born, and others on the fifth day after its birth.

Over this feast-day the goddess Nundina was supposed to preside. The midwives, nurses, and domestics handed the child backwards and forwards, around a fire burning on the altars of the gods, after which they sprinkled it with water; and hence this feast received the name of amphi-drornia. The old women mixed saliva and dust with the water; and the whole ended with a sumptuous entertainment. The parents received gifts from their friends on this occasion. If the child was a male, their door was decked with an olive garland; if a female, with wool, denoting the work about which women were employed.
