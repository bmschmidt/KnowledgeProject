LEUTMERITZ, a circle in the Austrian kingdom of Bohemia, extending over 1394 square miles, containing forty-two cities and towns, 942 villages, and 54,060 houses, inhabited by 300,711 individuals. It is a romantic district of hills, covered with wood, and narrow valleys of considerable natural fertility. The Elbe carries off the waters of the many small streams which run through the valleys. It is productive of corn, flax, hops, fruit, and yields some wine, and may be considered as a granary for part of the kingdom of Saxony. The capital, from which the circle derives its name, is a city situated on the Elbe, and surrounded with walls and ditches. It has a magnificent cathedral and eleven other churches, a town-hall, 565 houses, and 3950 inhabitants. Long. 13. 1. 33. E. Lat. 50. 31. 38. N.
