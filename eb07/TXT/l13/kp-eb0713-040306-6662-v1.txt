LOAD, or Lode, in Mining, a word used especially in the tin mines, and signifying any regular vein or course, whether metallic or not; but load most commonly means a metallic vein. When the substances forming these loads are reducible to metal, the loads are by the English miners said to be alive; otherwise they are termed dead loads.

Load is also used for nine dishes of ore, each dish being about half a hundredweight.
