LAON, an arrondissement in the department of the Aisne, in France. It is 960 square miles in extent, is divided into eleven cantons, and these into 291 communes; and contains 141,650 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, situated on a hill in an extensive plain. The ancient cathedral is the only remarkable edifice. It contains 1600 houses, and 7000 inhabitants, who are employed in preparing hosiery and leather, and in trading in corn and wine.
