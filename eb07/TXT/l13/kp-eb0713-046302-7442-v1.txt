LOJA, or Loxa, a city of Spain, in Granada, within the province of Andalusia. It is situated about twenty miles from the city of Granada, in a gorge between the stupendous mountains which seem to shut in the plain from the rest of the kingdom. At the bottom of this fissure, the river Xenil runs from the plain, and the streets of the city rise above each other on the declivities of the mountain. It was a place of vast military importance when the Moors were in possession of Granada, as it is the only entrance on the western side of the plain. The surrounding country is thickly covered with olive woods, which yield a great quantity of oil. Some corn is raised, but not sufficient for the population, who are supplied with the remainder by exchanging oil. It contains about 9000 inhabitants.
