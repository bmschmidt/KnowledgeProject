LUTHERANISM, the opinions and doctrines of Martin Luther in regard to religion.

Lutheranism has undergone some alterations since the time of its founder. Luther rejected the epistle of St James, as inconsistent with the doctrine of St Paul relating to justification; and he also set aside the Apocalypse, both of which are now received as canonical in the Lutheran church. He reduced the number of sacraments to two, viz. Baptism and the Eucharist; but he believed in impanation, or the consubstantiation of the matter of the bread and wine with the body and blood of Christ; and it is in this article that the main difference consists between the Lutherans and English church.

Luther maintained that the mass was no sacrifice, and exploded the adoration of the host, auricular confession, meritorious works, indulgences, purgatory, the worship of images, and other observances which he considered as the growth of corrupt times. He also opposed the doctrine of free-will, maintained predestination, and asserted our justification to be solely by the imputation of the merits and satisfaction of Christ. He likewise opposed the fastings in the Roman Catholic church, monastical vows, the celibacy of the clergy, and many things besides.
