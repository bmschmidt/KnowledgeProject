LOMBARD, Peter, well known by the tide of Master of the Sentences, was born at Novara, in Lombardy; but being bred at Paris, he distinguished himself so much at that university, that he had conferred on him the canonry of Chartres, was for some time tutor to Philip son of Louis le Gros, and lastly obtained the see of Paris. He died in 1064. His work of the Sentences is regarded as the source of the scholastie theology of the Latin ehurch. He also wrote Commentaries upon the.Psalms, and upon St Paulâ€™s Epistles.
