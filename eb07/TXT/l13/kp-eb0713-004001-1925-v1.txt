LAMIAe, a sort of demons who had their existence in the imaginations of the heathens, and were supposed to devour children. Their form was human, resembling beautiful women. Horace makes mention of them in his Art of Poetry. The name, according to some, is derived from lanio, to tear; according to others, it is a corruption of a Hebrew word signifying to devour. They are also called larvoe or l√©mures.
