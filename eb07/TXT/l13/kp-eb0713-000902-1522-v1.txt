LACTHO, a province of India beyond the Ganges, tributary to the sovereign of Cochin-China. It is bounded on the south by Lars, on the north and east by Tungquin, and on the west by China. This territory has been but imperfectly explored by Europeans; but it is described by the Tungquinese as mountainous, rocky, covered with jungle, and destitute of navigable rivers, with a singularly pestilential air, and water very unwholsome, though the climate is cooler than that of Tungquin. The interior is inhabited by numerous tribes, little better than savage, governed by hereditary chiefs, and perpetually at war with each other. Salt is imported into this country from Tungquin; also salt-fish, oil, and some silk stuffs for the chiefs. The exports to Tungquin are chiefly buffaloes and cotton. Shells and cowries form the medium of exchange. According to information derived from the Tungquinese, this province contains many extraordinary natural caverns, which appear to have served the natives as temples. One cavern is described as a mile across, perforating a mountain, and another as being entered under ground in a boat.
