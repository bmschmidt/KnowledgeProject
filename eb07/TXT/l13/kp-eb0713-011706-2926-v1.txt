LATERAN was originally the proper name of a man, from whom it descended to an ancient palace in Rome, and to the buildings since erected in its place, particularly a church called St John of Lateran.

Couneils of the Lατerαn are those which were held in the basilica of the Lateran. Of these there have been five, which were held in 1123, 1139, 1179, 1215, and 1513, respectively.

Canons Regular of the Congregation of the Lateran is a congregation of regular canons, of which that church is the principal place or seat.

It is pretended that there has been an uninterrupted succession of clerks, living in community, from the time of the apostles; and that a number of these were established in the Lateran in the time of Constantine. But the canons were not introduced till the time of Leo I.; and these held the church eight hundred years, till the reign of Boniface, who took it from them, and placed secular canons in their room. A century and a half thereafter, the regulars were reinstated.
