LAGOS, a city of Portugal, the capital of the province of Algarve. It is a seaport, in a bay of the same name, celebrated for the naval victory obtained in it by Admiral Rodney over the Spanish fleet commanded by Don Juan de Langara, in the American war. The vicinity of Lagos is very mountainous, and abounds with woods, which are converted into charcoal, with which fuel it supplies a great portion of the south of Spain and Portugal. It is fortified and well built, has two parish churches, three monasteries, two hospitals, one alms-house, 801 houses, and 4050 inhabitants. A small harbour, guarded by two forts, is good, and can contain a whole fleet. It trades in wine, oil, figs, and corn, and has sumptuous aqueducts.
