LANJANG, or Lan≈£chang, a city of Laos, situated on the river Mecon, of which we have no very exact accounts. It is said to be extensive and splendid. The palace of the sovereign is equal in extent to a city, while those of the grandees are large and elegant. The dwellings of the lower orders are, as usual in the East, mere huts. Long. 104. 38. E. Lat. 18. 30. N.
