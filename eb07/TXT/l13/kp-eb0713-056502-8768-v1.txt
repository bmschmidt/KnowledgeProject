LONGUS, a Greek sophist, author of a book entitled 'nοιμενικα, or a romance containing the loves of Daphnis and Chloe. Huet, bishop of Avranches, speaks very favourably of this work; but he censures the obscene touches with which it is interspersed. None of the ancient authors mention Longus, so that the time when he lived cannot be fixed with certainty. There is an English translation of this author, which is ascribed to Mr Craggs, who was at one time secretary of state.
