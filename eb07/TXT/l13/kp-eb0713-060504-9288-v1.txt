LYCOMEDES, in fabulous history, a king of Scyros, an island in the Aegean Sea. He was son of Apollo and Parthenope, and was secretly intrusted with the care of young Achilles, whom his mother Thetis had disguised in womanâ€™s clothes, in order to prevent him proceeding to the Trojan war, where she knew he must unavoidably perish. Lycomedes rendered himself famous for his treachery to Theseus, who had implored his protection when driven from the throne of Athens by the usurper Mnestheus. Lycomedes, as is reported, either envious of the fame of his illustrious guest, or bribed by the emissaries of Mnestheus, led Theseus to an elevated place, on the pretence of showing him the extent of his dominions, and perfidiously threw him down a precipice, by which means he was killed.
