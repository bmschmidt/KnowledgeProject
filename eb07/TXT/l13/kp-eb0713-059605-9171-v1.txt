LUSTRUM, in Roman antiquity, a general muster and review of all the citizens and their goods, which was performed every fifth year by the censors, who afterwards made a solemn lustration. This custom was first instituted by Servius Tullius, about 180 years after the foundation of Rome. In the "course of time the lustra were not celebrated so often; for we find the fifth lustrum celebrated at Rome only in the 574th year of that city.
