LOOK-OUT, in nautical language, a watchful attention to some important object or event which is expected to arise from the actual situation of a ship with reference to other objects. It is principally used in navigation when there is a probability of danger from the real or supposed proximity of land, rocks, or enemies; in short, whatever peril she may encounter through inattention, but which might be avoided by a prudent and necessary vigilance.
