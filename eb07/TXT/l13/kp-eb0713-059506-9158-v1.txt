LUNENSE Marmor, in the natural history of the ancients, the name of that species of white marble now known amongst us by the name of Carrara marble, and distinguished from the statuary kind by its greater hardness and inferior splendour. It has ever been greatly esteemed in building and ornamental works, and is so still. It is of a lose and fine texture, of a pure white, and much more transparent than any other of the white marbles. It has always been found in great quantities in Italy, and is so to this day.
