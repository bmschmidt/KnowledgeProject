LAIS, a celebrated courtezan, daughter of Timandra, born at Hycara in Sicily. It is said that she first began to sell her favours at Corinth for ten thousand drachmas. This gave rise to the proverb, Non cuivis homini contigit adire Corinthum. The success which her gallantries met with at Corinth encouraged her to pass into Thessaly, and more particularly to enjoy the company of a favourite youth called Hippostratus. She was, however, disappointed. The women of the place, jealous of her charms, and apprehensive of her corrupting the fidelity of their husbands, assassinated her in the temple of Venus, about 340 years before the Christian era. Some suppose that there were two persons of this name, a mother and her daughter.
