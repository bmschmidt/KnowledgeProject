QUESTOR, or Quaestor, in Roman antiquity, an officer who had the management of the public treasure. The questorship was the first offiee which any person eould hold in the commonwealth, and have a right to sit in the senate. At first there were only two; but afterwards two more were created to take eare of the payment of the armies abroad, and to sell the plunder, for whieh purpose they generally accompanied the consuls in their expeditions. On this account the latter were called peregrini, as the former were called urbani. The number of questors was afterwards greatly increased. They had the keeping of the decrees of the senate; and hence came the two offices of quaestor principis, or augusti, sometimes called candidatus principis, whose offiee resembled in most respeets that of our secretaries of state, and the quaestor palatii, answering in a great measure to our lord-chaneellor.
