QUATRE-BRAS, a village of the Netherlands, in the circle of Nivelles, receiving its name from two great roads crossing each other at this point, where there is a directionpost with four arms. It is worthy of remark as the spot where the first meeting took place between the British and French troops two days before the decisive battle of Waterloo. This contest was obstinate and bloody, and the loss on both sides heavy, whilst the success was doubtful. The British received there the intelligence of the defeat of the Prussians at Ligny; and their artillery not being come up, they retreated the next day to the field of Waterloo, where they completed the work of the campaign. The reigning duke, Frederick William of Brunswick, fell in the attack of the French on his troops.
