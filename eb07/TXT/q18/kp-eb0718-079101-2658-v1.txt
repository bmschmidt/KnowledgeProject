QUESNE, Marquis du Quesne, admiral of the naval forees of France, and one of the greatest men of the seventeenth century, was born in Normandy in the year 1610. He contributed to the defeat of the naval power of Spain at Gattari; he was dangerously wounded before Barcelona in 1642, and on other occasions; and having entered into the service of the Swedes, he beeame vice-admiral, and entirely defeated the Danes, killing their admiral, and taking his ship. He was recalled into Franee in 1647, and commanded the squadron sent to Naples. The naval affairs of France being much decayed, he fitted out divers ships for the relief of the royal army that blockaded Bordeaux, whieh was the principal eause of the surrender of the town. He was very fortunate in the wars of Sieily, where he defeated the Dutch thrice, and De Ruyter was killed. He also obliged the Algerines to sue in a very humble manner for peaee from Franee. In short, Asia, Afriea, and Europe, felt the effects of his valour. He was a Protestant; yet the king-bestowed on him the land of Bouehet, and, to immortalize his memory, gave it the name of that great man. He died in 1688.
