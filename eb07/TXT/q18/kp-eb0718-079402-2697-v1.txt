QUINTESSENCE, in Chemistry, a preparation consisting of the essential oil of some vegetable substance, mixed a‚àèd incorporated with spirit of wine.

Quintessence, in Alchemy, is a mysterious term, signifying the fifth or last .and highest essence of power in a natural body. Or, when divested of its alchemical signification,and employed to express something that is intelligible, the word denotes merely the highest state of purification in which any body can be exhibited.
