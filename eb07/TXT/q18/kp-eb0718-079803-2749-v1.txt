QUORUM, a word frequently mentioned in our statutes, and in commissions of justices of the peace and others. It is so called from the words of the commission, quorum A B unum esse volumus. Where a commission is directed to seven persons, or to any three of them, whereof A B and C D are to be two, in this case they are said to be of the quorum, because the rest cannot proceed without them.
