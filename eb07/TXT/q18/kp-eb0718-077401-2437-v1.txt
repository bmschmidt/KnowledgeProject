QUALLA MOORBA, a river and port situated on the western coast of Malacca. The river is a large one; but the entrance into it is interrupted by a heavy surge, which breaks during the south-west monsoon, and has raised a dangerous sand-bank at the mouth, which extends three miles out to sea. This river is, however, frequented by vessels, which come here on account of the tin-mines in its vicinity. It is 18 miles south of Queda.
