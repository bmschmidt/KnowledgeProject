QUINQUEREMIS, in the naval architecture of the ancients, is a name given to a galley which had five rows of oars. They in general divided their vessels into monocτota and pοlycτοta. The former had only one tier of rowers; the latter had several tiers of them, from two or three, up to twenty, thirty, or even forty; for in the time of Philopater we have an account of such a vessel, which required no less than four thousand men to row it.
[7:18:794]

Meibomius has diminished the imaginary improbability of there ever having been such a vessel, by reducing the enormous, height supposed to be necessary for such a number of rows of oars, and men to. work them, and finding a better way of placing the men than others had thought of. The quinqueremes of the ancients had 420 men in each, 300 of whom were rowers, and the rest soldiers. The Roman fleet at Messina consisted of 330 of these ships; and the Carthaginian, at Lilyboeum, of 350 of the same size. Each vessel was 150 feet in length. Thus, 130,000 men were contained in the one, and 150,000 in the other, with the apparatus and, provisions necessary for such expeditions as they were intended for. This gives so grand an idea of the ancient naval armaments, that some have questioned the truth of the statement; but wc find it related by Polybius, an historian too authentic to be questioned, and who expresses his wonder at the circumstance whilst he relates it.
