QUARTU, a city of the island of Sardinia, in the diocese of Cagliani. It stands on a bay of the same name. Though many of the houses are respectable, they are all built of bricks dried by the sun. The walls of the church-yard arc strangely decorated with skulls and thigh-bones. The situation is tolerably healthy. The inhabitants amount to 5129.
