WALLINGTON, a hamlet in the parish of Beddington and hundred of its own name in the county of Surrey, eleven miles from London. It is only remarkable for the printing and bleaching grounds within it, on the banks of the river Wandle. The great rivalry from the calico-printers in the north has suspended the progress of the manufactures of this place. The population amounted in 1821 to 847, and in 1831 to 933.
