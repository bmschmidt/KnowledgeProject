WATEEHOO, an island in the South Pacific Ocean, about six miles long and four broad, discovered by Captain Cook in 1777. Long. 158. 15. W. Lat. 20. 1. S.

WATER, a well-known fluid, diffused through the atmosphere, and over the surface of the globe, and abounding in a certain proportion in animals, vegetables, and minerals. See Physical Geography. Water, Holy, is used in the church of Rome, as also by the Greeks, and by the other Christians of the east of all denominations; and it consists of water with a mixture of salt, blessed by a priest according to a set form of benediction. It is used in the blessing of persons, things, and places; and is likewise considered as tending to excite pious thoughts in the minds of the faithful. The priest, in blessing it, first, in the name of God, commands the devils not to hurt the persons who shall be sprinkled with it, or to abuse the things, or disquiet the places, which shall likewise be so sprinkled. He then prays that health, safety, and the favour of heaven, may be enjoyed by such persons, and by those who shall use such things, or dwell in such places. Vestments, vessels, and other such things that are set apart for divine service, are sprinkled with it. It is sometimes sprinkled on cattle, with an intention to free or preserve them from diabolical enchantments; and in some spiritual books there are prayers to be said on such occasions, by which the safety of such animals, as being a temporal blessing to the possessors, is begged of God, whose providential care is extended to all his creatures. As a ceremony, says the Catholic, water brings to our remembrance our baptism, in which, by water, we were cleansed from original sin. It also puts us in mind of that purity of conscience which we ought to endeavour always to have, but especially when we are to worship our God. The salt, which is put into the water to preserve it from corrupting, is also a figure of divine grace, which preserves our souls from the corruption of sin; and is likewise an emblem of that wisdom and discretion which ought to season every action that a Christian does, and every word that he says. It is wont to be blessed and sprinkled in churches on Sundays, in the beginning of the solemn office. It is kept in vessels at the doors of the same churches, that it may be taken by the faithful as they enter in. It is also often kept in private houses and chambers.

Water-Spout, an extraordinary meteor, consisting of a large mass of water collected into a sort of column, and moved with rapidity along the surface of the sea. See PHYSICAL Geography.
