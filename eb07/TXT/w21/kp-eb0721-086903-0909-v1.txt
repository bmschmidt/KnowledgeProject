WHEELER, Sir George, a learned traveller and divine, was the son of Colonel Wheeler of Charing in Kent, and was born in 1650 at Breda, where his parents, as royalists, were then in exile. In 1667 he became a commoner of Lincoln College, Oxford, but did not take a degree. He travelled through various parts of Greece and the East, in company with Dr Spon of Lyon; and taking orders on his return, was installed a prebendary of Durham, made vicar of Basingstoke, and afterwards rector of Houghton le Spring. He published an account of his Journey into Greece in 1682 in folio; and in 1689 an Account of the Churches and Places of Assembly of the primitive Christians, from the Churches of Tyre, Jerusalem, and Constantinople, described by Eusebius. He is likewise author of a [7:21:870] work entitled “The Protestant Monastery, or Christian Oeconomics.” In 1702 he was created D. D. by diploma. He died in 1724.
