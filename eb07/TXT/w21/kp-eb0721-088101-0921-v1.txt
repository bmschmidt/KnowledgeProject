WICKWAR, a small market town of the county of Gloucester, seventeen miles from Bristol and 111 from London. It is in the hundred of Grumbaldâ€™s Ash, and was formerly a place of more importance than it is at present. There is a spacious church with a lofty tower, and a grammar-school endowed by a native of the name of Hosea. It has a market on Wednesday. The population amounted in 1821 to 919, and in 1831 to 972.
