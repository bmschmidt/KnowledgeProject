WILTON, a market and borough town of the county of Wilts, three miles from Salisbury and eighty-three from London. It stands on the river Willy, in the hundred of Branch and Dole, and returns one member to the House of Commons. It has a market on Wednesday. This place has given its name to a description of carpets first made here, and the manufactory is still extensively carried on, as well as that of some woollen cloths. Adjoining to the town is the magnificent seat and park of the earl of Pembroke. It was the residence of Sir Philip Sidney, where he composed his Arcadia. The population amounted in 1821 to 2058, and in 1831 to 1997. Several neighbouring villages have been added to the borough to form an adequate constituency.
