WIASMA, a circle of the Russian government of Smolensko, extending in north latitude from 54째 55' to 55째 30', and in east longitude from 33째 15' to 34째 25'. It is a poor district, in which are the sources of the river Dnieper. The capital is the city of the same name, on the river Wiasma. Like most old Russian cities, it is surrounded with weak walls. It was burnt by the French in 1812, but has been rebuilt, and is now stated to contain 2000 houses, mostly of wood, with 12,000 inhabitants, who carry on an extensive trade by the river with St Petersburg, chiefly in corn. It is 489 miles from St Petersburg. Long. 33. 5. E. Lat. 55. 6. N.
