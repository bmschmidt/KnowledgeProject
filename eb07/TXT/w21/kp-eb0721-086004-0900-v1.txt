WESTERHAM, a market-town of the county of Kent, in the lathe of Sutton, and the hundred of the same name, twenty-two miles from London. It is on the borders of Surrey, is pleasantly situated and neatly built, with some very good houses. The market-house, though small, is an elegant building. The church contains a monument to General Wolfe, who was a native of this place. There is a market on Wednesday for corn. The population amounted in 1821 to 1742, and in 1831 to 1926.
