WITTENBERG, a circle of the Prussian province of Saxony, and of the government of Merseburg, extending over 330 square miles, and comprehending five cities and towns, 104 villages, and 28,700 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name on the river Elbe, over which is a wooden bridge of about 1000 feet in length. It is a place endeared to the Protestants of Germany, as the cradle of the reformed religion, where Luther first preached, and where he and Melanchthon were buried. It now contains five churches, 320 houses, and 6500 inhabitants, including the military and their families. The university has been removed, but the city still retains an ecclesiastical seminary. Wittenberg has suffered from the hostilities of 1813 and 1814. There is but little commerce, although some linen and woollen cloths are made, and there are several distilleries and breweries. Long. 12. 39. 39. E. Lat. 51. 52. 45. N.
