WAFERS, or Sealing Wafers, are made thus. Take very fine flour, mix it with glair of eggs, isinglass, and a little yeast; mingle the materials; beat them well together; spread the batter, being mode thin with gum-water, on even tin plates, and dry them in a stove; then cut them out for use. You may make them of what colour you please, by tinging the paste with Brazil or vermilion for red; indigo or verditer, &c., for blue; saffron, turmeric, or gamboge, &c., for yellow.
