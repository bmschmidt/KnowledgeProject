WALTHAM ABBEY, a market-town of the county of Essex, in the hundred of Waltham, eleven miles from London. It takes its name from the stately abbey erected there by Harold, son of Earl Godwin, and afterwards further endowed by Henry II. The present church was formed out of a part of the ancient building. The town has a market on Tuesday, and three annual fairs. An establishment has been formed by government for the manufacture of gunpowder. The population amounted in 1821 to 1883, and in 1831 to 2013.
