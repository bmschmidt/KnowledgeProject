WANDIPOOR, a town and fortress of Hindustan, province of Bootan, in the territories of the rajah. It is a place of great strength, being situated on the narrow extremity of a rock, between three rivers, the confluence of whose streams takes place at its sharpened point, and forms a river of considerable magnitude, called the Chantchieu, which falls into the Brahmapootra. At Wandipoor there is a curious bridge of fir, without the least iron in its construction, of 112 feet span, which is said to have lasted 150 years, without exhibiting any symptoms of decay. The climate here is excessively cold, and subject to high winds. The town is consecrated, and is the residence of a considerable number of gylongs or priests of the grand lama.
