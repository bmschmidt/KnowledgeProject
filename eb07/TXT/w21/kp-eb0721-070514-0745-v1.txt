WAIGATZ, a large island belonging to the Russian government of Archangel. It is situated between 69° 26' and 70° 5' north latitude, and between 47° 20' and 50° 13' east longitude. It is separated from the mainland by the straits of its name. It is low, stony, destitute of woods, and almost of vegetation; but being well stocked with wild animals, especially such as yield valuable furs, it is inhabited [7:21:706] by some families, who are almost exclusively occupied in their chase and destruction. Its shores abound in fish; and immense flocks of birds frequent the island, whose feathers are of considerable value, and in pursuit of which many pcrsons repair to the island in the appropriate season. To the south-west of this large island are three others, called Malvijef, Dolgoi, and Bilinov, whose products are of a similar kind.

Waigatz Straits, situated between Nova Zembla and Russia, through which the Dutch sailed to the north, as high as 75°, in order to discover a north-east passage to China and the East Indies.
