WEIGHT, in Physics, a quality in natural bodies, whereby they tend downwards towards the centre of the earth. Or, weight may be defined, in a less limited manner, to be a power inherent in all bodies, whereby they tend to some common point, called the centre of gravity, or, to speak more accurately, to one another; and that with a greater or less velocity, as they are more or less dense, or as the medium they pass through is more or less rare.
