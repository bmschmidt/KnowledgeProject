WHAMPOA, a seaport of China, situated on an island in the river Canton, about two miles below Canton city. Here is a safe anchorage for large ships, which carry on their communication with Canton by boats. The island on which Whampoa is situated is called Bankshall island, from being the place where storehouses are constructed of bamboos and mats, to contain the shipsâ€™ stores, &c. Immediately on the arrival of any vessel, two custom-house boats are placed alongside, to prevent smuggling; and without their permission no goods can be shipped or landed. All European ships are allowed to wear a flag in their boats, which prevents their being stopt at the custom-house. Lat. 23.6. N.
