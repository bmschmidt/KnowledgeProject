WALCHEREN, an island, forming part of the province of Zealand, in the kingdom of Holland. It stands on the north entrance of the western Scheldt, is highly fertile, though unhealthy to foreigners, especially in the autumn, when they are liable to be attacked by that description of fever which takes its name from the island, and which proved so ruinous to the British army after its capture in 1809. It contains the populous cities of Middleburg and Flushing, and many large villages, and about 33,000 inhabitants.
