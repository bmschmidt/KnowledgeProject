WAGGON, a wheel-carriage, of which there are various forms, accommodated to the different uses for which they are intended. The common waggon consists of the shafts or rods, being the two pieces which the hind horse bears up; the welds; the slotes, or cross pieces, which hold the shafts together; the bolster, being that part on which the fore-wheels and the axle-tree turn in wheeling the waggon across the road; the chest or body of the waggon, having the staves or rails fixed thereon; the bales, or hoops which compose the top; the tilt, the place covered with cloth, at the end of the waggon. See MecHANIcs.
