WOKINGHAM, a market-town of Berkshire, in the hundred of Sunning, thirty-two miles from London. It is within Windsor Forest, and the courts by which it is regulated are held here. It has a large market-place, which is well attended on Tuesday, an endowed school; and near it is an hospital, founded in 1663, for a master and six brethren under the direction of the company of the drapers in London. There is also a charity of L.50, to be paid to three maidens who have served the same master during three successive years. The population in 1821 amounted to 2490, and 1831 to 2692.
