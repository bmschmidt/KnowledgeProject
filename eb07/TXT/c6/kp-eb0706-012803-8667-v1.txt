CAPRIOLES, in the man√®ge, leaps that a horsc makes in the same place without advancing, in such a manner that, when he is at the height of the leap, he jerks out with his hinder legs even and near. It is the most difficult of all the high manege. It differs from a croupade in this, that in a croupade a horsc does not show his shoes; and from the ballotadc, because in the latter he does not jerk out. To make a horse work well at caprioles, he must be put between two pillars, and taught to raise first his fore quarters, and then his hind quarters while his fore ones are yet in the air, for which reason you must give him the whip and the poinson.
