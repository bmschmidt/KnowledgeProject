CLEOBIS and Biton, two youths, sons of Cydippe, the priestess of Juno at Argos. When oxen could not be procured to draw their motherâ€™s chariot to the temple of Juno, they put themselves under the yoke, and drew it forty-five stadia to the temple, amidst the acclamations of the multitude, who congratulated the mother on the filial piety of her sons. Cydippe entreated the goddess to reward the piety of her sons with the best gift that could be granted to a mortal; upon which they went to rest and awoke no more; and by this the goddess showed that death is the only truly fortunate event that can happen to man. The Argives raised them statues at Delphi.
