CAPRICORN, in Astronomy, one of the twelve signs of the zodiac.

The ancients accounted Capricorn the tenth sign; and when the sun arrived thereat, it made the winter solstice with regard to our hcιnispherc; but the stars being advanced a whole sign towards the east, Capricorn is now rather the eleventh sign; and it is at the sun’s entry into Sagittary that the solstice happens, though the ancient manner of speaking is still retained.

The sign is represented on ancient monuments, medals, and the like, as having the fore part of a goat, and the hind part of a fish, which is the form of an Aegipan; and sometimes simply under the form of a goat.

Tropic of Capricorn, a lesser circle of the sphere, which is parallel to the equinoctial, and at 23° 30' distance from it southwards, passing through the beginning of Capricorn.
