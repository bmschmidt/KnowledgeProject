CENTENARIUS, or Centenario, in the middle ages, an officer who had the government or command, with the administration of justice, in a village. The centenarii as well as vicarii were under the jurisdiction and command of the court. We find them among the Franks, Germans, Lombards, Goths, and other nations.

Centenarius was also used to signify an officer who had the command of one hundred men, most frequently called a centurion.

Centenarius, in monasteries, was an officer who had the command of one hundred monks.
