CHELSEA, a parish in Middlesex, adjoining to London, which has grown to be more populous than many cities. It contains the hospital for invalid soldiers, the military asylum, a noble institution for the orphan children of soldiers, three churches, two of recent erection, and the botanic garden. A bridge across the Thames connects it with the county of Surrey. The palace of the Bishop of Winchester, which stood here, has been lately taken down. There are several extensive nursery-grounds and gardens, and some large floor-cloth manufactories. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 18,262, in 1821 to 26,860, and in 1831 to 32,371.
