CENSIO, in Antiquity, the act or office of the censor. Censio included both the rating or valuing of a manâ€™s estate, and the imposing of mulcts and penalties.

Censio Hastaria, a punishment inflicted on a Roman soldier for some offence, as laziness or luxury, and so called because his hasta or spear was taken from him, and consequently his wages and hopes of preferment were stopped.
