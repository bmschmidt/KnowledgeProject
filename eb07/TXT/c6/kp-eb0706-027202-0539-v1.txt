CELINDRO, or Chelindreh, a small sea-port and bay of Asia Minor, on the coast of Caramania, where the couriers from Constantinople embark for the island of Cyprus. It has several remains of antiquity near it, and it is supposed to be the ancient Celenderis of Strabo. It is fifty-four miles north of Cerino, in the island of Cyprus.
