CLESIDES, a Greek painter, about 276 years before Christ, in the reign of Antiochus I. He revenged the injuries he had received from Queen Stratonice, by representing her in the arms of a fisherman. But however indecent the painterâ€™s representation of the queen, she was drawn with such personal beauty, that she preserved the piece, and liberally rewarded the artist.
