CARRARA, a city of Italy, in the province Massa Carrara, under the Duke of Modena. It is situated high up on a mountain, contains a cathedral and several other churches, a ducal palace, and 6550 inhabitants, who find employment chiefly in the celebrated marble quarries, and in some measure in spinning silk.

Carrara Marble, among our artificers, the name of a species of white marble, which was called marmor lunense, and ligustrium by the ancients. It is distinguished from the Parian, now called the statuary marble, by being harder and less bright.
