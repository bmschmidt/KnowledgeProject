CASPIAN, or Kashan, a flourishing city of Persia, situated in a stony plain, very ill supplied with water. It is a large town, extending about three miles in length from east to west, and more than a mile and a half in breadth. Cashan had for the most part fallen into ruin; but, by the exertions of the prhne minister of Persia, it has recovered from its ruins, and has now become one of the most flourishing cities of Persia. Its public buildings arc a royal palace, and many fine mosques, bazars, and caravanserais.
