CARINA, a Latin term, properly signifying the heel of a ship, or that long piece of timber running along the bottom of the ship from head to stern, upon which the whole structure is built or framed.

Carina is also frequently used for the whole capacity [7:6:142] or bulk of a ship, containing the hull or all the space below the deck. Hence the word is also sometimes used by a figure for the whole ship.

Carina is likewise used in the ancient architecture. The Romans gave the name of carina to all buildings in the form of a ship, as we still give the name of nave to the middle or principal vault of our Gothic churches, because it has that figure.
