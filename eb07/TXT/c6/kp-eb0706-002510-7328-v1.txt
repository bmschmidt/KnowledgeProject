CALLINGAPATAM, a town of Hindustan, on the sea coast of the Northern Circars, seventy miles north-east from Vizagapatam. Long. 84. 15. E. Lat. 18. 25. N.

CALLINGER, a district of Hindustan, in Bundelcund, and province of Allahabad, situated between the 24th and 26th degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the river Jumna, and on the west by Bundelcund; but to the east and south its boundaries are not distinctly defined. The country is mountainous. The river Cane runs through its whole extent from south to north, and falls into the Jumna at Jana. Its principal towns are Callinger, Senrab, and Attouah. The country produces ebony and diamonds, a few elephants, much iron, and a quantity of cotton. This country, from time immemorial, has been independent, until of late years. It was, indeed, frequently overrun by the Afghans, Moguls, and Mahrattas, and compelled to pay tribute; but the rajah still retained his fort and his title. In 1022 he was at the head of the Hindu confederacy against the Mahommedans. In 1803 this district was ceded by the Mahrattas to the British, and was completely subdued by their troops, when the rajah was forced to retire on a pension. The natives are Hindus of the Rajpoot tribe.

Callinger, a strong town and celebrated fortress of Hindustan, and capital of the above district. It is built of stone on the top of a lofty mountain, is five miles in circumference, and is well supplied with water from several tanks which are inclosed within it. It is surrounded by a thick wood, which, though it adds to its strength, renders it unhealthy. This fort has been often besieged, but generally without success. The celebrated Mahmoud of Ghizn√© attempted its capture in 1024, but without success; and Lhen Shah, the Afghan who expelled the Emperor Humayon from the throne of Hindustan in 1545, was slain in attempting to take it. From the want of a battering train in the early periods of Indian history, it was found impracticable to take so strong a fortress; and the siege was generally converted into a blockade, though ultimately without success. A garrison of 5000 men would be required to defend the works. In 1810 the British laid regular siege to the fortress, which had become a rallying point for all the banditti of the country; but they were repulsed with great slaughter in an attempt to carry this stronghold by storm. So intimidated, however, was the garrison by their determined efforts, that they evacuated the place during the night. Since this period it has been garrisoned by a battalion of native infantry and a detachment of European artillery. There are famous[7:6:26] diamond mines to the south of this fort. Long. 80. 25. E. Lat. 24. 58. N.
