CELLINI, Benvenuto, an eminent statuary, who was bred a jeweller and goldsmith, but seems to have had an extraordinary genius for the fine arts in general. He was contemporary with Michel Angelo and Julio Romano, and was employed by popes, kings, and other princely patrons of sciences and arts, which were so highly cultivated in the days of Leo X. and Charles V. Some of his productions were esteemed as equally exquisite in design and execution. He lived to a very considerable age; and his life, almost to the last, was a continued series of adventures, persecutions, and misfortunes. He wrote the history of his own life, whieh, however, was not published till the year 1730, probably on account of the excessive freedom with which he had treated many distinguished personages of Italy and other countries. There are several English translations of this curious work.
