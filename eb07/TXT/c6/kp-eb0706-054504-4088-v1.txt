CHILKA, a lake in Hindustan, at the north-castern ex-tremityof the Northern Circars, which province it separates towards the sea from that of Cuttack. It extends about thirty-five miles in length by tcn or twelve in breadth, and appears to have originated in a breach of the sea over a flat and sandy shore. The border of sand, about a mile broad, by which it is separated from the sea, is not visible, so that the lake has the appearance of a deep bay. It is very shallow, and contains several inhabited islands. On the north-west it is bounded by a ridgc of mountains, which forms a continuation of those which extend from the Mahanuddy to the Godavery river, and inclose the Northern Circars towards the continent. It is forty miles south-west of Cuttack.
