CALENDERS, a sort of Mahommedan friars, so called from Santon Calenderi, their founder. This Santon went 1 bareheaded, without a shirt, and with the skin of a wild beast thrown over his shoulders. He wore a kind of apron , before, the strings of which were adorned with counterfeit precious stones. His disciples are rather a sect of epicures than a society of religious persons. They honour a tavern as much as they do a mosque, and think they pay as acceptable worship to God by the free use of his creatures, as others do by the greatest austerities and acts of devotion. They arc called in Persia and Arabia Abdals, or Abdallat, that is, persons consecrated to the honour and service of God. Their garment is a single coat, made up of a variety of pieces, and quilted like a rug. They preach in the market places, and live upon what their auditors bestow on them. They are generally very vicious persons; for which reason they are not admitted into any houses.
