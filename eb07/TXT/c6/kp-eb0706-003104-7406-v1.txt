CAMBERT, a French musician in the seventeenth century, was at first admired for the manner in which he touched the organ, and became superintendent of music to Anne of Austria, the queen-mother. The Abb√© Perin associated him in the privilege he obtained from his majesty, of setting up an opera in 1669. Cambert set to music two pastorals, one entitled Pomona, the other Ariadne, which were the first operas given in France. He also wrote a piece entitled The Pains and Pleasures of Love. These pieces pleased the public; yet, in 1672, Lully obtaining the privilege of the opera, Cambert was obliged to come to England, where hc became superintendent of music to king Charles II.; and died there in 1677.
