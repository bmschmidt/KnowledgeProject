CARLSKRONA, a province of Sweden. It is bounded on the north by Cronoberg, on the north-east by Kalmar, on the cast and south by the Baltic Sea, and on the west by Christianstadt. Its extent is 1122 square miles, and it contains a population of 67,200 persons, inhabiting three cities, three market-towns, and 1091 hamlcts.

Carlskrona, the capital of the Swedish province of the same name. It is the seat of the boards for regulating the marine administration of the kingdom. It is built on five small islands, connected by bridges with the main land. It contains docks, store-houses, work-shops, hospitals, and all the other appendages of a naval arsenal. The haven is secure, and well adapted for the ships of war which are stationed in it. The city contains 1500 houses, and 10,533 inhabitants, chiefly depending on the fleet, but in some measure on the fisheries, and on the export of pitch, tar, timber, and some iron. The city suffers from the want of fresh water. Long. 15. 27. 40. E. Lat. 56. 6. 57. N.

CARLSRUHE, a city of Germany, the capital of the dominions of the Grand Duke of Baden. It is situated in the valley of the Rhine, about three miles from that stream, and 376 feet above the level of the sea. The city is built in a peculiar form, eight principal streets proceeding from a circular centre, and not unlike the stick of a fan when open, which produces a very striking effect in spite of the dulness of uniformity. The palace of the duke, and the other public buildings, arc, some tasteful, some magnificent; and the institutions for education, for charity, as well as the library, the museums, and various collections, are appropriate and well conducted. The inhabitants amount to 15,789, of whom 9299 are Lutherans, 4417 Catholics, 642 Calvinists, with some other sectaries, and a few Jews. It is a place of sonic trade, but chiefly confined to the sale of the various productions needed by the inhabitants of the duchy. The environs are beautiful, owing to the groves through which the roads to the city pass. Long. 8. 15. 25. E. Lat. 48. 59. 55. N.
