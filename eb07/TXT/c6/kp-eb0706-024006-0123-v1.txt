CATARACT, in Hydrography, a precipice in the channel of a river, caused by rocks or other obstacles stopping the course of the stream, whence the water falls with great noise and impetuosity. The word is derived from καταggασtfω, I tumble down with violence; compounded of κaτa, down, and gaotfw, dejicio, I throw down. Strabo calls that a cataract which we call a cascade ; and what we call a cataract the ancients usually called a catadupa. Herminius has an express dissertation, “De admirandis mundi Cataractis supra et subterraneis ;” where he uses the word in a new sense, meaning by cataract any violent motion of the elements.

CATAR A, a town of Dalmatia, and capital of the territory of the same name, with a strong castle and a bishop’s see. It is subject to Venice, and is seated on a gulf of the same name. Long. 19. 19. E. Lat. 42. 25. N.
