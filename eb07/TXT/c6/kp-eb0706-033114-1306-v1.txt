CHARRON, Peter, the author of a book entitled Of Wisdom, which gained him great reputation, was born at Paris in the year 1541. After being advocate in the parliament of Paris for five or six years, he applied himself to divinity, and became so great a preacher, that the bishops of several dioceses offered him the highest dignities in their gift. But he died suddenly in the street, at Paris, on the 16th of November 1603.
