CHAL ΛWAR, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Gujerat, which occupies an extensive tract of country between the Gulfs of Cutch and Cambay. It is situated between the twenty-first and twenty-second degrees of north latitude, and is about ninety miles in length from east to west, and about forty in breadth. The ra ι jah of Chalawar formerly ruled over the neighbouring districts of Warreaz, Puttun, and Chuwal. His residence was in the city of Dhama, of which there are at present scarcely any [7:6:307] vestiges. The inhabitants are chiefly of the Rajpoot tribe, divided into three classes, namely, the Jeenamas, the Ku- ’ raria, and the Naroda. The first are respectable, and are addressed by the title of Jee; the second perforin menial offices, and the last have relinquished their military character, and are degraded into the rank of cultivators. They have all an insurmountable objection to the flesh of a black goat, which they consideras unwholesome. A great proportion of this district is but thinly inhabited and poorly cultivated, and does not contain any town of note. It is laid waste by the predatory hostilities of the tribes who occupy it; and although the Mahratta chief, the Guicowar, claims the dominion over it, his authority is but little attended to. The country is of a broken, irregular aspect, and contains no rivers of any consequence.
