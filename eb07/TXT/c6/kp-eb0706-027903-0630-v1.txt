CENSITUS, a person censed or entered in the tables of the census. In an ancient monument found at Λncy-ra, containing the actions of the Emperor Octavius, we read,
Quo lustro civium Romanorum
Censita sunt capita quadragies
Centum millia et sexaginta tria:

From which we learn that the number of Roman citizens, entered in the censor’s rolls, was then upwards of four millions.

Censitus is also used in the civil law for a servile sort of tenant, who pays capitation to his lord for the lands he holds of him, and is entered as such in the lord’s rent-roll; in which sense the word is equivalent to capite census, or eaρite censitus. See Capite Censu
