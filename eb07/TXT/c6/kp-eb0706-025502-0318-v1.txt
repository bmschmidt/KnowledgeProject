CAVAN, the most southern county of the province of Ulster, in Irelend, is bounded by the counties of Leitrim, Fermanagh, Monaghan, Louth, Meath, Westmeath, and Longford. Its form is nearly circular, with the exception of the barony of Tullaghagh, which projects in a northwestern direction between the two first named of the surrounding counties. It lies nearly in the centre of Ireland, midway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Irish Sea, its extremities being less than eighteen miles from either of these waters. According to the latest and most accurate calculation, its contents are estimated at 473,450 acres, or 740 square miles.

The most ancient geographers speak of it as being inhabited by the tribe of the Erdini. At the period of the arrival of the English, and for some centuries afterwards, it was known by the name of the Brennie, Brennie O’Reylie, or O’Reylie’s country. Under a commission issued by James I. for the subdivision of the county, it was portioned out into seven baronies, two of which were assigned to Sir John O’Reylie, three to his brother, uncle, and the representatives of another of the family, while the two remaining baronies, possessed b} r the septs of M i Rcrnon and M i Gaurol, being remote, and bordering on O’Rorke’s country, now the county of Leitrim, were allowed to continue subject to the exactions of the Irish lords, the crown reserving two hundred beeves upon the whole county for the lord-deputy’s provision. There was also an ancient subdivision of the county into small portions called polls, each containing twenty-four acres. It is now divided into the baronies of Castleraghan, Clonkee, Clonmaghon, Upper and Lower Loughtee, Tullaghgarvey, Tullaghagh, and Tullaghonoho. At present the county rates are levied according to a peculiar measurement. A certain number of town lands are united under the name of a carvaglι, of which each barony contains a thousand, making eight thousand carvaghs for the whole county. Hence, if these were all of an equal size, which is not the case, as they vary with the superficial contents of their respective baronies, each would contain something less than sixty acres.

The county, according to its civil arrangements, under which the local taxes are levied, eontains twenty-nine parishes, besides four parts of parishes, the remaining parts of which are in the adjoining counties, three in Meath, and one in Fermanagh; but, according to its ecclesiastical arrangement, into thirty-three, of which twenty-nine are in the diocese of Kilmorc, three in that of Ardagh, and one in that of Meath. The bishopric of Kilmorc extends over the whole of the county. The seat of the see is at Kilmore, a small town nearly in the centre of Cavan. According to the latest return made to parliament, the see lands amounted to 47,361 acres, but no statement was then sent in as to the pecuniary value of the see.

The population was estimated by Beaufort in 1792 at 81,570 souls; in 1813, according to the imperfect census then taken, it was supposed to be 164,000; in 1821, by the census of that year, it amounted to 195,076; and, according to the late but imperfect census of 1831, it was 228,050, giving an increase, in forty years, of 146,480 souls, or nearly double of its amount at the earliest of these dates.

The county sends two representatives to the imperial parliament. Before the union it sent six, two for the county, and two each for the towns of Cavan and Bel turbet.

The surface of the country is very uneven, consisting altogether of hills and valleys, without any level ground. The hills rise to a considerable elevation in the interior. The highest land in the county is the mountain of Slieve Russel, in the barony of Tullaghagh, on the confines of Fermanagh. In the same barony is Quilca Mountain, which is held in great veneration by the inhabitants, who relate many traditionary fables connected with the ancient superstitions of the country. It was also the place for installing the M i Guires, the chieftains of Fermanagh.

The valleys arc, in many parts, the receptacles of lakes, which, though not of very extended dimensions, arc objects of much interest, from the picturesque beauties of their scenery. Lough Ramor, one of the largest, is in the southern extremity of the county, near Virginia. It contains several islands, once well wooded, but now mostly bare. Lough Gawnagh, in the south-west, may be considered rather as a boundary between Cavan and Fermanagh, than as exclusively belonging to cither county. The same observation applies to Lough Shillin. Lough Ough-ter lies between the towns of Cavan and Killeshandra. Though not of very imposing dimensions, the irregularity of its form, the large and beautiful islands imbedded in its waters, and the many deep recesses studded with overhanging woods that wind among its high banks, produce a rich variety of prospect. The interest excited by its natural beauties is augmented by a circumstance of historical notoriety. Bishop Bedel, when taken prisoner during the civil wars of 1641, was confined in Cloghoughter, one of its islands. The castle, which was used as the prison of this venerable prelate, is still pointed out to strangers. Becleľs remains were deposited in Kihnore church. 'The most remarkable of the smaller lakes, which are to be met with in most parts of the county, is Lough Swillan, in the neighbourhood of Shercock, it being considered by many as the principal source of the river Erne. According to others, this river, the largest in the county, derives its origin from the Lake of Scrabo, one of the minor sheets of water that form Lough Gawnagh. The river itself takes a northerly direction by Killcshandra and Belturbet, being enlarged during its course by the Croghan, Ballyhayes, Annalee, and other streams. It enters Lough [7:6:256] Erne at its most southern extremity, passes through it, and discharges itself into the Atlantic at Ballyshannon, in the county of Donegal. Woodside River, which skirts the county on the side of Fermanagh, falls into Lough Erne at the same place. The Shannon is said by some topographers to take its rise in Quilca Mountain, under the name of the Owenmore, which it changes for its more celebrated appellation on its junction with the Doubally, at the point where it enters the county of Leitrim, a few miles before it discharges its united streams into Lough Allen.

The climate of this county is chilly, and the weather often boisterous, particularly in the mountainous districts. The soil is a stiff wet clay, cold and spongy, producing a coarse rushy pasturage, beneath which is usually a thick stratum of brown clay, resting upon a heavy yellow argillaceous substratum. The soil is much improved by draining, for which its undulating surface affords great facilities, and by gravelling or liming. Limestone is scarce in some districts, yet much sought after; so that it is at times drawn from distances of ten or twelve miles. In other parts, particularly throughout the baronies of Castleraghan, Clonkee, and Clonmoghan, marl, which is met with very generally, is preferred to lime, as the latter forms hard lumps when mixed with the clay soil, while the former renders the soil loose and friable. A very fine kind of manure, formed of decayed limestone, is found in the mountainous parts of Tullaghagh. In the banks of rivers it is in great plenty; and about a mile from Swadlingbar there is a large pile of it, which, when used judiciously, produces most luxuriant crops.

Bog of the best quality, the red ashes of which form an excellent manure, is abundant. The upper part next the surface is dense and close, and makes the best fuel; that immediately under is friable, and therefore less valued as fuel. The bottom is solid and serviceable. In the moorish bogs, in which argillaceous strata are met with throughout the peat, marl abounds, and is very easily raised.

A rich iron ore was raised from Quilca Mountain, and long wrought with considerable profit. The ore was smelted at Swadlingbar, where mills were erected for the purpose; but the works were ultimately relinquished, in con-quence of the failure of timber for fuel. At Ortnacullagh, near Ballyconnel, fragments of lead and silver ore are carried down the stream. Pure sulphur is also found there. In this and in other parts of Tullaghagh barony, fullers’ earth, pipe-clay, potters’ clay, and brick-clay, are frequently met with. Fine white and red transparent spars have also been occasionally picked up near Fermanagh. There are indications of coal in Lugnaguilla, the most north-western point of the county. It is also said that this mineral has been found in the mountain of Slieve Russel, where it has been dug out of the side of the hill in blocks near the surface. Another vein is said to exist at Glasleek, near Shercock, of a very sulphureous quality, burning well, and emitting a bright blue flame.

These indications of minerals are accompanied with their usual concomitants, mineral springs. The most remarkable is that of Swadlingbar, which has long maintained a high character for its efficacy in restoring debilitated constitutions. Its predominant ingredient is sulphur. Near the same village there is a chalybeate spring. The small lake of Lough Leighs, or Lough-an-Leighaghs, which signifies the healing lake, on the summit of a mountain between Bailieborough and Kingscourt, is celebrated for its antiscorbutic qualities. Its waters are used for drinking and bathing; but the most beneficial effects are said to be produced by the mud raised from the bottom of it being rubbed on the diseased part. The level of the lake never varies. It has no visible supply nor vent for its discharge; neither is it ever frozen or changed in temperature during the severest winters. The water at the surface is clear; but within a foot downwards it becomes clogged with mud, which thickens as the lake descends, to a depth hitherto unascertained. The mud is drawn up for medical purposes from a depth of thirty feet, by means of a pole with a hay-rope twisted round it, to which it adheres, exhibiting, when exposed to the atmosphere, a greasy shining surface like tar. The water is slightly chalybeate. The best season for its use is from June to August. It is said to have been effectual in the cure of leprosy. Other mineral springs of inferior note are those of Derrylester, containing sulphur and natron; Owen Bruen, containing sulphur and calcareous nitre; and Carrickmore, containing calcareous nitre, alkali, and some sulphur. The water of the last named is extremely cold.

The general character of the people is highly favourable. They are much inclined to acts of kindliness towards each other; their hospitality to strangers is proverbial, and they testify the most laudable anxiety for the education of their children. Crimes of atrocity are uncommon. According to a parliamentary return in 1830, the total number of individuals committed for offences during that year was 171, of whom only 61 were convicted; of these thirty were for illicit distillation, seventeen for larceny, and the rest for assaults, cattle-stealing, and vagrancy. Domestic manufactures are generally combined with agricultural occupations. The culture of flax and the fabric of linens of coarser qualities formerly employed much of the time not required for the external labours of the farm; but this source of profitable employment has gradually declined with the general depression of the linen manufacture in Ireland. The farms are small, from thirty to seven acres, the smallest being the more numerous, in the proportion of ten to one. In the mountainous parts, where the land is chiefly under grazing, the farms are more extensive. Wheat and barley are but little cultivated. The hilly grounds are chiefly under oats, of which the more elevated parts produce a very hardy species, quite black. They are sown after one or two crops of potatoes; and these two vegetables form the principal part of the food of the peasantry 7 . In the mountainous parts the plough is never used, in consequence of the rocky nature of the ground. The loy, a kind of· spade long in the blade, with a peculiar curve to prevent the adhesion of the soil, is used in its stead. With this instrument the grain is trenched in high ridges. Twelve men can dig an acre in a day. The undulating nature of the ground, and the copious supply of water from the numerous small lakes and rivers, render the land well suited for draining; but this and other modes of improvement are in many instances checked, in consequence of the short and unsatisfactory tenure by which much of the land in this country is held under church and school land leases. The general character of the farming may be summed up in the expression, that the people are by no means wanting in exertion, but their modes of culture are defective. Most farmers prefer the old Irish breed of black cattle, because, though less inclined to fatten, they give a larger quantity of milk. The oxen of Lough tee barony arc an exception to this remark.

Illicit distillation was carried on here to a great extent. The lakes afforded great facilities to its practice. The grain was steeped in them, and the portable and cheap apparatus employed in the process was set up close to their borders; so that, in case of alarm, the whole could be flung into the water at a moment’s notice, and remain concealed till raised again for future service. The practice, so injurious to industry and moral improvement, is considerably on the decline.

The soil, in those districts not well adapted for tillage, [7:6:257] is peculiarly favourable for trees. Shrubs, which flourish vigorously in spi<e of the inclemency of the climate, spring out of the fissu∙∙es of the rock on the mountainous districts. Throughout «-'he barony of Loughtee, and more particularly along tl*J rich tract watered by the Erne, timber trees are to be seen in great numbers. They are chiefly to be found i-∙ι demesnes, where the gentry seem to vie with one anotl ’ er i∏ their cultivation; so that the bareness of the landscape, too long a glaring drawback upon the natural beauties of the county, is every day less observable. The seats of the resident gentry are numerous and elegant. Lord Farnham has a noble mansion at Cavan. A fine see-house, now building by the Bishop of Kilmore, is nearly completed. Villas of much architectural and rural elegance are to be seen in various parts of the county.

According to the returns made under the population act in 1821, and by the commissioners of education in 1824-5, the state of education was as follows:
[table]

The religious persuasions of the pupils in the latter of these two statements were as follows :—Of the established church, 4004; dissenters, 922; Roman Catholics, 12,648; religion not ascertained 164. The number of schools was 346: of these, 280, containing 12,700 pupils, were wholly maintained by the fees of the pupils; and the remaining 66, containing 5039 pupils, were supported by the contributions of the higher classes, or by grants or endowments of public money. ∙

The population of the county is chiefly rural. None of its towns contains 3000 inhabitants, and but five contain more than 1000 each.

Cavan, the capital of the above county, has little to recommend it to special notice. It is situated near the centre of the county, in the parish of Urney, and barony of Upper Loughtee, on one of the tributary streams of the Erne. Its situation is pleasant and healthful, being a large valley, surrounded on every side by elevated grounds. A hill immediately above the town, on the Dublin side, commands a very extended prospect. The town was burnt down in 1791. The consequence has been that it has risen from its ashes in an improved form, excepting some of the suburbs, which consist of a succession of mud-built hovels, the seats of squalor and destitution too often to be seen in similar situations in other country towns of Ireland. The court-house is elegant in its proportions, and convenient in its internal arrangements. The church, built on an elevated site, at one extremity of the town, is also an elegant erection. Not far from the church is a large Roman Catholic chapel, which, together with a dissenting house, was erected at the expense of Lord Farnham, the proprietor of the town. In another quarter is the county infirmary, to the support of which the surrounding gentry contribute liberally. Six alms-houses for destitute widows have been founded by a bequest of a member of the Lanesborough family. The most conspicuous building is the grammar-school, one of the royal foundations of Charles I. It was rebuilt about thirty years ago, at an expense of L.7500, on an eminence overlooking one of the main entrances into the town. It is large and handsome, though by no means highly ornamented, and is capable of accommodating upwards of one hundred resident pupils. The master enjoys a salary of L.300 per annum, besides the fees from pupils, with an additional allowance of L.100 for an assistant; he has also the produce of ten acres of land adjoining the house. Notwithstanding these advantages, the residents of the town and neighbourhood have for some years reaped little benefit from this noble endowment, in consequence of the very advanced age of the head master; nor have their remonstrances to the board of education under whose superintendence it is, and which consists of the four archbishops, and several of the bishops, nor their application to the lord lieutenant, in whose gift is the disposal of the mastership, as yet been effectual in procuring for them the benefits of liberal education for their children contemplated by its royal founder. The sons of the neighbouring gentry, and of the respectable resident inhabitants, are therefore sent, at much expense and inconvenience, to distant places for their literary improvement. The county jail is a substantial building, but rather small for the average number of its inmates. A monastery of Dominican friars, founded by O’Reilly, chieftain of the Brennie, existed here; and it was the place of burial of the celebrated Irish general Owen Roe O’Neal, who died by poison at Cloghoughter in 1649. The town was incorporated by a royal charter of James I., dated 15th November, in the eighth year of that monarch’s reign. The population in 1821 amounted to 2320, and in 1831 to 2322.

CAVANILLES, Antonio Jose, a Spanish ecclesiastic, who devoted himself with great assiduity to the study of botany, and has published several important works, was born in 1745, at Valencia. He received his first education among the Jesuits in that university, and he ever afterwards retained the urbanity of character and manners characteristic of that celebrated order of men. But this was, in him, accompanied with more estimable qualities of the heart than are usually attributed to that order, or than any other exclusively possesses. He early devoted himself to the studies of divinity and philosophy, and was distinguished for diligence and ability, not only in these pursuits, but in the mathematics, history, and belles-lettres. He afterwards removed to Murcia, where he acquired so much credit that he was chosen by the Duke de l’Infantado to superintend the education of his sons. In the house of this nobleman he was perfectly domesticated; and when, after a course of years, the death of his patron broke up a circle of more than usual domestic virtue and felicity, at least in that elevated rank of life, the Abbé Cavanilles became only a more valuable and confidential friend of the survivors. He accompanied the sons of the duke, in their father’s lifetime, to Paris in 1777, where he resided twelve years, adding to his various information, and particularly cultivating the science of botany, with all the aids which that celebrated capital was so well calculated to afford. Here he was more particularly associated with the famous Jussieu, and the pupils of his school. From the Linnaean botanists of Paris he was a good deal estranged; yet he acquired a great inclination towards the Swedish school, and imbibed many of its good principles.

.The first publication of the Abbé Cavanilles was in French, entitled Observations sur l'article ii Espagne" de μ Nouvelle Encyclopédie. This pamphlet contained a defence of his country, against what appeared to him an unfair attack upon it; but we know not the particular subjects of the discussion. We have no difficulty in conceiving that they might be manifold, and that there were few opinions upon which a man of Cavanilles’ correctness and orthodoxy of character, to say nothing of his patriotism, was likely to agree with the writers of the above-mentioned celebrated work.

He soon afterwards devoted himself to a study which promised him a less thorny path. In 1785 he published at Paris his first Dissertation upon Monadelphous Plants, a [7:6:258] Latin 4to, containing the species of the genus Sida, with some plants nearly related thereto. The plates, uncoloured, were executed from his own drawings; as were those of the rest of his numerous publications. The specimens delineated in this first essay were too small and imperfect. In that respect his following dissertations, making ten in all, have a considerable superiority. His subsequent figures were also better engraved. The descriptions are full and correct; the new species numerous; and the specific characters tolerably classical, though not quite uncontaminated by the feebleness and ambiguity of the French school. This work, in its beginning, not being received by the Linnaean botanists of Paris, and especially by ĽHeritier, with any respectful attention, the author, in an evil hour, was induced to complain, in the Journal de Paris, of negleet and injustice. ĽHeritier had not noticed the book in his Stirpes Novae ; had published the same plants by different names, without citing Cavanilles; and had even antedated some of his own Fasciculi, in order to conceal, as it appeared, this literary incorrectness. His reply could not, in the opinion of unprejudiced witnesses, clear him of illiberal conduct; though, it is very certain, he neither did nor could borrow any thing from Cavanilles. It would have been better to have declared the truth, that his own plates were already engraved with different names, or that he had at least chosen such as seemed to him preferable. The authority of ĽHeritier’s works, by their transcendent merit, has prevailed, while Cavanilles has retained all the credit due to correctness of principle and intention. The ninth and tcηihfαsciculi of Cavanilles, on the Monadelphous Plants, were indeed published at Madrid, to which place the author returned in 1790. The number of plates in the whole work are 296, many of which, especially in the earlier part, contain several species. It cannot be denied that the merit of this work kept increasing as it advanced. The abilities of the writer gained strength by exercise, and his knowledge was enriched by experience. He is charged with admitting as monadelphous too many plants, the union of whose stamens is very light or uncertain; but it were ungrateful to complain of any book for the riches of its materials. A more real fault is, the usual one of too great and artificial a subdivision of genera. This is also the fault of the school in which he studied, though the grpat man at its head is perhaps as free from it as any leading writer.

Soon afterwards the Abbé Cavanilles began a larger and more comprehensive publication, in folio, entitled Icones et Descriptiones Plantarum quae aut sponte in Hispania crescunt, aut in Hortis hospitantur. The first volume appeared in 1791, containing 100 plates, with ample descriptions. It was followed by five more, of equal size and merit, the last of which came out in 1801. The whole work is enriched with critical remarks, and with much economical, as well as what may be called picturesque and sentimental, matter, respecting many native Spanish plants. The exotic part of these volumes is derived from the highly valuable and novel discoveries of the Spaniards in Mexico, Peru, and Chili, and the acquisitions of some voyagers to New Holland and the Philippine Islands. Hence numerous very fine plants, originally discovered by our own celebrated circumnavigators, but unfortunately not yet published by them, have first been made known in the pages of Cavanilles.

In the course of the botanical tours of our author, he collected materials for a general History of the Kingdom of Valencia, which appeared in 1795, in Spanish, making two volumes. This work, which we have never seen, is said to bo rich, not only in what relates to the three kingdoms of nature, but likewise, in statistical and antiquarian information.

Having in June 1801 been intrusted with the directorship of the royal garden at Madrid, he published in 1802 another work in his native tongue, containing the characters and descriptions of the plants demonstrated in his public botanical lectures. To these is pre⅛ e d an exposition of the elementary principles of the science, together with explanations of botanic terms. Cavanilles wιs also a frequent and important contributor to the periodica 1 , work entitled Anales de Ciencias Naturales, published at Madrid. Some observations of his, translated from this journal, may be found in Dr Sim’s and Mr König’s Annals of Botany, vol. i. 409. The first of these indeed, relative to certain seemingly lenticular bodies, supposed to have an important share in the impregnation of ferns and mosses, he has himself contradicted, as arising from an optical deception. His candid avowal of this, in a letter to Dr Schwartz, is published in volume second of the said Annals, p. 587. We think him also mistaken in the true stigma of the Iris, his opinion being sufficiently refuted by those of Kolreuter and Sprengel, given in a note, in the very place just quoted; nor is his idea of the stamens of certain Asclepiadea correct. If he errs, however, he errs with great authorities.

The subject of our present memoir undoubtedly excelled more in practical observation than in physiological speculation. He is said to have prepared, and partly printed, the first volume of a Hortus Matritensis, being a sort of sequel to his leones ; for it was intended to contain, not merely the figures and descriptions of curious or new plants from the garden, but also of rare dried specimens from the museum at Madrid. This work, with any other project in favour of science which he might have formed, was cut short by his death, in May 1804, in the fifty-ninth year of his age. An engraved portrait of the Abbé Cavanilles, at the age of forty-four, is given in Schrader’s Neues Journal, published at Erfurt in 1805. Dr Schwartz, in the Annals of Botany above quoted, gives this testimony to his worth, ii Cavanilles was, like many others, often rather hasty in his conclusions, but always eager to promote science. He was, indeed, a man of a very noble mind, and of the most generous communicative turn; so that I feel I have lost much by his untimely decease, which I shall ever regret.” (x. x.)
