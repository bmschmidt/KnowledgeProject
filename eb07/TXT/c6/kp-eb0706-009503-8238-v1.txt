CANONIZATION, a ceremony in the Romish church, by which persons deceased are ranked in the catalogue of the saints. It succeeds beatification.

Before a beatified person is canonized, the qualifications of the candidate are strictly examined into, in consistories held for that purpose; after which, one of the consistorial advocates, in the presence of the pope and cardinals, pronounces the panegyric of the person who is to be proclaimed as a saint, and gives a particular detail of his life and miracles; which being done, the holy father decrees his canonization, and appoints the day.

On the day of canonization the pope officiates in white, and their eminences are dressed in the same colour. St Peterâ€™s church is hung with rich tapestry, upon which the arms of the pope, and of the prince or state requiring the canonization, are embroidered in gold and silver. An infinite number of lights blaze all round the church, which is crowded with pious souls, who wait with devout impatience till the new saint has made his public entry as it were into paradise, that they may offer up their petitions to him without danger of being rejected.
