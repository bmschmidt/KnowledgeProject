CARNEDDE, in British antiquity, denotes heaps of stones, supposed to be druidieal remains, and thrown together on occasion of confirming and commemorating a covenant, Gen. xxxi. 46. They are very coţnmon in the Isle of Anglesey, and were also used as sepulchral monuments, in the manner of tumuli', for Mr Rowland found a eurious urn in one of these carneđde, whence it may be inferred, that the Britons had the eustom of throwing stones on the deeeased. From this custom is derived the Welsh proverb Karn ardyben, I’ll betide thee.
