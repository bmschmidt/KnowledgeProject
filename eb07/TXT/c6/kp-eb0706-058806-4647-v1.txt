CHINGLEPUT, the chief town and fortress of a district of the same name. The town is situated on the northeast bank of the Paiar river, thirty-nine miles southsouth-west from Madras, and was formerly the residence of the Hindu ehief. In 1751 Chingleput was taken by the French, and was retaken in 1752 by Captain Clive. During the wars of the British with Hyder Ali, it was one of the few strongholds which withstood his power, and afforded a secure refuge to the natives. In 1780, after the defeat of Colonel Baillie, the army of Sir Heetor Munro sought protection under its walls. It is now the residence of the British civil establishment, namely, the judge, collector, &e. Long. 79. 55. E. Lat. 12. 56. N. The district of Chingleput, formerly denominated the Jaghire, now forms the eollcctorship of Chingleput, situated on the seashore, between Madras and the Palar river. Till about the end of the seventeenth century this territory was governed by a Hindu chief. It was then conquered by the Mahommedans, and annexed to the government of Arcot. This tract of territory was obtained in 1750 and 1763, from the nabob of Arcot. In 1780 it came under the manage-mcnt[7:6:589] of the Madras presidency. It was twice invaded by Hyder Ali, in 1768 and in 1780, when he so ravaged it with fire and sword, that at the termination of the war in 1784 it presented a perfect desert. Famine succeeded to the ravages of war, and the country was nearly depopulated. In 1790 it was placed under the management of British collectors, and the country is said to be gradually recovering. The population in 1822 amounted to 363,129. Besides Madras, the principal towns are Chingleput and Conjeveram.
