CHOCO, a province of Mexico, in the department of Cauca. It abounds in woods and mountains, and is crossed by a chain of the Andes. Maize, plantains, and cocoa of excellent quality, are produced in abundance. It possesses rich gold mines, and a considerable trade is carried on with the neighbouring province of Popayan. But Choco would be richer in the fertility of its hills, and the superior quality of its cocoa, than in its mines, did not the cloudy and burning climate almost paralyse human industry. The population amounts to about 40,000.
