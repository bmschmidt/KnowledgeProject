It is bounded on the north-east by Luneburg; on the south-east by Hildesheim; on the south by Brunswick, the Prussian eircle of Minden, and Pyrmont; and on the west by Lippe, Schaumburg, and Hoya. It is 1090 square miles, or 667,800 English aeres, in extent; and contains a populatiou of 151,000 persons. The eity of Hanover is the capital of the prineipality, as well as of the kingdom. The southern part is generally hilly, but with broad valleys interposed. The northern division is part of that sandy plain which extends through the Continent, and is of little fertility cxeept in a few spots. The principal produets are eorn,cattle, butter, and flax; and the latter, made into yarn or eloth, is almost the only article manufactured for exportation. The river Weser flows through one part of this principality; and the Leine, whieh also passes through it, has by great efforts been made navigable.
