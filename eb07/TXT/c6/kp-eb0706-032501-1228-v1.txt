CHARAIMS, a sect of the Jews in Egypt. They live by themselves, and have a separate synagogue; and as the other Jews are remarkable for their eyes, so are the Charaims for their large noses, which run through all the families of this sect. They are the ancient Essenes, and strictly observe the five books of Moses according to the letter, receiving no written traditions. It is said that the other Jews would join the Charaims; but the former not observing the exact rules of the law with regard to divorces, the latter think they live in adultery.
