CAXATAMBA, a province of Peru, bounded on the north by Guailas, on the north-east by Chonchuios, on the east by Guamalies, on the south-east by Tarma, on the south by Chancay, and on the north-west by Santa. It is a hundred miles from north-east to south-west, and about the same extent from north-west to south-east. It lies for the most part amongst elevated mountains, and is consequently cold; but it abounds in all sorts of seeds and fruits, and cattle of every species are plentiful, more especially sheep, from the fleece of which its inhabitants manufacture cloth of a peculiar kind. The capital, which is of the same name, is situated in lat. 10. 27. S.
