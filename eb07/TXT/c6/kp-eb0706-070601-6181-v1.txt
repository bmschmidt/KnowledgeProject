CIRENCESTER, a borough and market town of the hundred of Crowthorne, in the county of Gloucester, and eighty-eight miles from London. The canal uniting the Thames and Severn is in connection with the town, and gives it access to the districts on both these rivers. This town was built by the Romans, and many antiquities of that people are to be seen in the neighbourhood. The church is a large and beautiful building, supported by two rows of pillars, and the tower is furnished with a ring of twelve bells. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 4540, in 1821 to 4987, and in 1831 to 5420.
