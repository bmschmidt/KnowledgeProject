CAROLOSTADIANS, or Carlostadians, an ancient sect or branch of Lutherans, who denied the real presence of Christ in the eucharist.

They were thus denominated from their leader Andrew Carolostadius, who having originally been archdeacon of Wittemberg, was converted by Luther, and was the first of all the reformed clergy who took a wife; but disagreeing afterwards with Luther, chiefly in the point of the sacrament, he founded a sect apart. The Carolostadians are the same with what are otherwise denominated Sacramentarians, and agree in most things with the Zuinglians.
