CAMIS, or Kamis, in the Japanese mythology, denote deified souls of ancient heroes, who are supposed still to interest themselves in the welfare of the people whom they anciently commanded. The camis answer to the hcrocs in the ancient Greek and Roman mythology, and are venerated like the saints in the modern Roman church.
