CAPTURE, a prize or prey, particularly that of a ship taken at sea. Captures made at sea were formerly held to be the property of the captors after a possession of twenty-four hours; but the modern authorities require that, before the property can bc changed, the goods must have been brought into port, and have continued a night intra praesidia, in a place of safe custody, so that all hope of recovering them has been lost.
