CHAM, or Khan, the title given to the sovereign princes of Tartary. The word, in the Persian, signifies mighty lord; in the Sclavonic, emperor. Sperlingius, in his dissertation on the Danish term of majesty, honing, king, thinks the Tartarian chαm may bc well derived from it; adding, that in the north they say han, können, konge, kοηηiηg, &c. The term chαm is also applied, among the Persians, to the great lords of the court, and the governors of provinces.
