CASUIST, a person who proposes to resolve cases of conscience. Escobar has made a collection of the opinions of all the casuists before him. Μ. le Féore, preceptor of Louis XIII. called the books of the casuists expositions of the art of quibbling with God; and from the multitude of distinctions and subtilties they abound withal, this does not seem far from truth. Mayer has published a bibliotheca of casuists, containing an account of all the writers on cases of conscience, ranged under three heads; the first comprehending the Lutheran, the second the Calvinist, and the third the Romish casuists.
