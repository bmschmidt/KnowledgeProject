CAMANA, a province of Peru, bounded on the northwest and north by the province of Ica, on the north-east by that of Lucanas, on the east by those of Parinacochas and Condesuios, on the south-east by that of Collahuas, and on the west by the South Sea. It is about twenty-five leagues in length, by about fourteen in breadth at the widest part. It consists of a series of valleys, which for the most part terminate in the coast. These abound in vines, of which brandy is made; but they arc liable to suffer from drought, there being little rain except during the months of January, February, and March. Towards the mountainous ridges of the Andes it is, however, more frequent. Gold mines are situated in this neighbourhood; but, from the difficulty of working them, they yield but little profit. Camana, the capital of the province, stands upon the river Mages, about two leagues from the sea. The inhabitants are about 1500 in number; but they were formerly more considerable. It is 70 miles west of Arequipa. Lat. 16. 17. S.
