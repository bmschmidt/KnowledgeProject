CENSER, in Antiquity, a vase containing incense to be used in sacrifices. Censer is chiefly used in speaking of the Jewish worship. Among the Greeks and Romans it is more frequently called thuribulum, λ ∣ ^avuτις, and acerra.

The Jewish censer was a small sort of chafing dish, covered with a dome, and suspended by a chain. Josephus tells us that Solomon made twenty thousand golden censers for the temple of Jerusalem, to offer perfumes in, and fifty thousand others to carry fire in.
