It is commended by the poets for its swans, whieh it had in great numbers. Its souree was in the Montes Cilbiani. After many windings through the plains of Ephesus, it becomes deeper, and flows smoothly into the sea near that eity. At the foot of Mount Gallesus it is crossed by an ordinary bridge of three arches. It is sometimes ealled by the Turks Little Meendras, after the river Meander, which it resembles in its windings.
