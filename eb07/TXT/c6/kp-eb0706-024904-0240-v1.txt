CATROU, Francis, a famous Jesuit, born at Paris in 1659. He was engaged for twelve years in the 'Journal de Trévoux, and applied himself at the same time to other works, which rendered him distinguished among the learned. He wrote a general history of the Mogul empire, and a Roman history, in which he was assisted by Father Rouillé, a brother Jesuit. Catrou died in 1737, and this last history was continued by Rouillé, who died in 1740. The titles of his works are, 1. Histoire Generale du Mogol, 1705, 4to, with E Histoire du Regne (ľAurengzeb, 1715; 2. Histoire dιι Eanatisme dans la Religion Protestante, contenant ľ Histoire des Anabaptistes, du Davidisme, et des Trembleurs, Paris, 1733, 3 vols. 12mo; 3. Traduction du Virgile, with notes critical and historical, 1729, 4 vols. 12mo; 4. Histoire Romaine, 1725-37, 21 vols. 4to; besides his productions inserted in the Journal de Trévoux.

CχΙTTARO, the southernmost of the circles into which the Austrian kingdom of Dalmatia is divided. It’is surrounded, except on the sea frontier, by the Turkish dominions, and comprehends the district distinguished as the Mouths of the Cattaro. It extends over 585 square miles, or 366,000 English acres, and contains about 30,000 inhabitants. Although sufficient corn for the consumption of only five months is raised, the other products, which furnish a considerable export trade, are both valuable and abundant. It affords oil, wine, figs, silk, wool, tallow, wax, honey, and fish. The inhabitants also buy many sheep and oxen of the people of Montenegro, which they salt and export, as they do much cheese, chiefly from the Turks.

Cattaro, a small city, the capital of the district of the same name, on the shores of the Adriatic. It is strongly fortified, both by sea and land. It is the seat of a Catholic bishop, and contains, besides the cathedral, a Catholic collegiate church, a Greek church, a Francisean monastery, and three female convents. There are about 600 houses, and nearly 3000 inhabitants. The harbour is good and secure, and frequented by many ships. Long. 18.58. E. Lat. 42. 22. N.
