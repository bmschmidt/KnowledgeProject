CHALCIDIC, Chalcidicum, or Chalcedonium, in the ancient architecture, a large magnificent hall belonging to a tribunal or court of justice. Festus says it took its name from the city Chalcis; but he does not explain the reason why it did so. Philander will have it to be the court or tribunal where affairs of money and coinage were regulated; so called from χαλκοί, brass, and boοrι, justice. Others say the money was struck in it, and derive the word from χαλ%oj, and o∕κoj, house. In Vitruvius it is used for the auditorium of a basilica; and in other ancient writers for a hall or apartment where the heathens imagined their gods to eat.
