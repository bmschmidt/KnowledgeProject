CARIBBEE Islands, a cluster of islands which stretch from Anguilla on the north to Tobago on the south, and form the eastern boundary of the Caribbean Sea. The name has been vaguely applied to the whole of the West India islands; but it strictly means that archipelago which extends somewhat in the form of a crescent, from Porto Rico to the coast of South America, and lies between the 58th and 63d degrees of west longitude, and between the I Ith and I9th degrees of north latitude. They are divided into Leeward and Windward Islands, or into the Great and Little Antilles, though the limits of these respective divisions have never been accurately fixed. The following are the principal of the Caribbees :â€”Santa Cruz, Som-buca, Anguilla, St Martin, St Bartholomew, Barbuda, Saba, St Eustatia, St Christopher, Nevis, Antigua, Montserrat, Guadaloupe, Deseada, Mariagalante, Dominica, St Lucia, St Vincent, Barbadoes, Grenada, and Tobago.
