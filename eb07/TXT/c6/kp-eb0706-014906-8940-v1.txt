CARNIOLA, a province of the Austrian empire, with the title of duehy. It is bounded on the north by Carinthia, on the north-east by Styria, on the east and southeast by Croatia, on the south by Dalmatia and the Adriatic, and on the west by Istria, Friuli, and the eounty of Grotz. Carniola is about 120 miles in length by 100 in breadth, and contains above 4700 square mile - s. It is divided either into Upper, Middle, Lower, and Inner Carniola, to which some add Austrian Istria, or into the circles of Laybaeh, Neustadt, and Adelsberg. This province, although'mountainous in the north and north-west, has extensive and fertile valleys and plains in the south, and is more populous than Carinthia. In the interior it bears a resemblance to that province in its general features, but it is more susceptible of culture, and produces wheat maize, millet, and the best flax in the dominions of Austria. The ground in the southern parts produces two crops a year. Fruit is very abundant, especially chestnuts and walnuts, of which there are entire forests. The mountains of Carmola are remarkable for their natural curiosities, and for their vast cavities and subterranean passages. The eataraets are numerous, and of a very striking and picturesque eharaeter. There arc several rivers, the principal of which is the Saave. Among the lakes, that of Zirknitz or Czirknitz is the most remarkable. It possesses two subterranean outlets, by which the whole of its waters are discharged, and for four months the bottom is dry, and a crop of millet and hay is produced on it.

Carniola, like Carinthia, possesses a number of iron, lead, and quicksilver mines. There are also varieties of the mineral kingdom, and precious stones are occasionally found. Woollens, linens, and laee, are the principal branches of manufacture. There are several iron forges and two glass works. Near the coast a considerable quantity of sea-salt is produced. The population amounts to about half a million.
