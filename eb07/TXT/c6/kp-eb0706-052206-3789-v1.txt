CHILBLAIN (pernio), in Medicine, a tumour affecting the feet and hands, accompanied with an inflammation, pains, and sometimes an ulcer, in which case it takes the denomination of chaps on the hands, and of kibes on the heels. Chilblain is compounded of chill and 5Zα⅛; that is, a blain or sore contracted by cold. Pernio is the Latin name adopted by physicians, and is derived byVos-sius from perna, a gammon of bacon, on account of some fancied resemblance. Chap alludes to gap, both in sound and appearance. Kibes, in Welch hibws, may be derived from the German kerben, to cut; the skin when broken appearing like a cut.

CHILDERMAS-Day, or Innocents Day, an anniversary held by the church of England on the 28th of December, in commemoration of the children of Bethlehem massacred by order of Herod.
