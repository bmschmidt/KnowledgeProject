CALLICRATES, an ancient sculptor, who engraved some of Homerâ€™s verses on a grain of millet, made an ivory chariot that might be concealed under the wing of a fly, and an ant of ivory in which all the members were distinct. But Aelian justly blames him for exerting his genius and talents in things so useless, and at the same time so difficult. He flourished about the year 472 before Christ.
