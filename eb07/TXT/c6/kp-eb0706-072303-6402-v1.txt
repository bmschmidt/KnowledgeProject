CLANS, in history, and particularly in that of Scotland, tribes or septs. The nations which overran Europe were originally divided into many small tribes; and when theycamc to parcel out the lands which they had conquered, it was natural for every chieftain to bestow a portion, in the first place, upon those of his own sept or family. These all held their lands of him; and as the safety of each individual depended on the general union, each small society clung together, and was distinguished by some common appellation, cither patronymic or local, long before the introduction of surnames or ensigns armorial. But when thcsc became common, the descendants and relations of every chieftain assumed the same name and arms with him; other vassals were proud to imitate their example; and by degrees the same distinctions were communicated to all those who held of the same superior. Thus clanships were formed; and in a generation or two, that consanguinity which was at first in a great measure imaginary was believed to bc real. An artificial union was converted into a natural one. Men willingly followed a leader whom they regarded both as the superior of their lands and the chief of their blood; and served him not only with the fidelity of vassals, but with the affection of friends. In the other feudal kingdoms, wc may observe such unions as wc have đcscribeđ, imperfectly formed; but in Scotland, whether they were the production of chance, or the effect of policy, or strengthened by preserving genealogies both genuine and fabulous, clanships were universal. Such a confederacy might be overcome, but it could not be broken; and no change of manners or government has been able, in some parts of the kingdom, to dissolve associations which are founded upon prejudices so natural to the human mind. It is easy to imagine how formidable were nobles at the head of followers, who, counting that cause just and honourable which their chief approved, were ever ready to take the field at his command, and to sacrifice their lives in defence of his person or of his fame. Against such men a king contended with great disadvantage; and that cold service which money purchases, or authority extorts, was not an equal match for the ardour and zeal generated by this patriarchal brotherhood in arms.

Some imagine the word clan to be only a corruption of the Roman colonia; but Mr Whittaker asserts that it is purely British, and signifies a family or sept.
