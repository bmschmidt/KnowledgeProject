CARMAGNOLA, a city of Italy, in the province of Turin, in the kingdom of Sardinia, on a small stream that runs into the Po. It contains an elegant church, and five others, four monasteries, and 1200 inhabitants, who carry on great commerce in silk and linen goods. The silk market in June is the most frequented of any in Piedmont, and the price fixed there generally rules that of the surrounding country.
