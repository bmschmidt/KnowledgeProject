JESUS, the Sωι of Sirach, a native of Jerusalem, composed, about 200 B. c. the Book of Ecclesiasticus, called by the Greeks ∏avageτoζ, “ replenished with virtue.” They also quote it under the title of the Wisdom of Jesus the son of Sirah. His grandson, who was also of the same name, and a native of Jerusalem, translated it from the Hebrew into Greek about 121 b. c. W r e have the Greek version, but the Hebrew text is lost.
