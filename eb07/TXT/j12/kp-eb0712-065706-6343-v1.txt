JUVENTAS, in Mythology, the goddess who presided over youth amongst the Romans. This goddess was long honoured in the capitol, where Servius Tullius erected a statue to her. Near the chapel of Minerva there was the altar of Juventas, and upon this altar a picture of Proserpine. The Greeks called the goddess of youth Hebe; but it has been generally supposed that this was not the same with the Roman Juventas.
