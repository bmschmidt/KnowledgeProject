JUJUBES, in the Materia Medica, the name of a fruit of the pulpy kind, produced on a tree which Linnaeus considers as a species of rhamnus. See Rhamnus.

The jujubes have been made a general ingredient in pectoral decoctions; but they are now seldom used on these occasions, and are scarcely at all heard of in prescription, or to be met with except in onr shops.
