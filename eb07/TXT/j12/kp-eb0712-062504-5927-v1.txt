JUDEA, or Judaea, in Ancient Geography, taken largely, denotes either all Palestine, or the greater part of it, and thus it is generally employed in the Roman history; Ptolemy, Rutilinus, Jerome, Origen, and Eusebius, using the word to signify the whole of Palestine. Here we consider it as denoting the third part of the country on this side of the Jordan, the southern part being distinct from Samaria and Galilee; and under such restriction it is often employed, not only in Josephus, but also in the Ncw Testament. It contained four tribes, Judah, Benjamin, Dan, and Simeon, together with Philistia and Idumea; and hence it was included between Samaria on the north, Arabia Petraea on the south, the Mediterranean on the west, and the Lake Asphaltites, with part of Jordan, on the east. Josephus divides it into eleven toparchies, and Pliny into ten; so that, according to both, it had a greater extent than that which is just mentioned. See Palestine.
