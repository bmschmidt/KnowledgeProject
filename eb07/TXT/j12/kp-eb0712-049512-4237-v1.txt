JAJGHUR, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Ajmeer, and capital of a district of the same name. It formerly belonged to the rajah of Odeypoor, from whom it was taken by Zalim Singh, chief of Kotah, about the year 1803. The surrounding district comprehends eighty-four villages and towns, twenty-tw o of which are inhabited by a race of plunderers called Meenas, who give only personal service for their lands. The fort of Jajghur is built on the top of an oblong hill, and consists of two walls with ruined bastions, each having a ditch, and the outer wall lying a considerable way down the hill. The town is large, well built, and fortified.
