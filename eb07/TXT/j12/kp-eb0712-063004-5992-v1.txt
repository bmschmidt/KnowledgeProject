JULY, the seventh month of the year, during which the sun enters the sign Leo. The word is derived from the Latin Julius, the surname of Caesar the dictator, who was born in it. Mark Antony first gave this month the name July, which before was called Quintilis, as being the fifth month of the year in the old Roman calendar established by Romulus, whieh began in the month of March. For the same reason, August was called Sextilis ; and September, October, November, and December, still retain the names of their original rank. On the 19tlι day of this month the dog-days are commonly supposed to commence, when, according to Hippocrates and Pliny, the sea boils, wine turns sour, dogs go mad, the bile is increased and irritated, and all animals decline and languish.

July- Plσwers. See Dianthus, Botany.
