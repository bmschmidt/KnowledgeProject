JUSTNESS, the exactness or regularity of any thing. Justness is chiefly used in speaking of thought, language, and sentiments. The justness of a thought consists in a certain precision or accuracy, by which every part of it is perfectly true, and pertinent to the subject. Justness of language consists in using proper and well-chosen terms; in not saying either too much or too little.
