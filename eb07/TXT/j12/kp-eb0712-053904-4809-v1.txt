JEHOVAH, one of the scriptural names of God, signifying the Being who is self-existent and gives existence to others. So great a veneration had the Jews for this name, that they discontinued the custom of uttering it, and hence its true pronunciation was forgotten. They called it tetragrammaton, or the name of four letters; and believed that whoever knew the true pronunciation of it could not fail to be heard by God.
