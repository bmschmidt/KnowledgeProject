JOSHUA, the renowned general of the Jews, who conducted them through the wilderness, and died in 1424 before Christ, aged a hundred and ten years.

Joshua, a canonical book of the Old Testament, containing a history of the wars and transactions of the person whose name it bears. This book may be divided into three parts; the first of which is a history of the conquest of the land of Canaan; the second, which begins at the twelfth chapter, is a description of that country, and the division of it amongst the tribes; and the third, comprised in the two last chapters, contains the renewal of the covenant which he caused to be made by the Israelites, together with the death of their victorious leader and governor. The whole comprehends a term of seventeen, or, according to others, of twenty-seven years.
