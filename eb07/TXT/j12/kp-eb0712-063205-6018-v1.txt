JUNTO, or Junta, in matters of government, denotes a select council for taking cognizance of affairs of great consequence, and requiring secrecy. In Spain and Portugal it signifies the same as convention, assembly, or board, amongst us. Thus, we meet with the junta of the three estates, of commerce, of tobacco, and the like.
