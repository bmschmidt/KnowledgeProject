JHINGWARA, a Coolee state in the province ofGnjerat, and district of Chalawar, containing between 5000 and 6000 houses. It is chiefly ruled by different branches of the same family, of which that of Virajee is the most powerful. The inhabitants are mostly Coolees, who have been degraded from their original rank of rajpoots. It was formerly much larger than it is at present, and was celebrated for a temple dedicated to the sun. On the banks of the Run, near this, a large quantity of salt is prepared, which is also a source of revenue.
