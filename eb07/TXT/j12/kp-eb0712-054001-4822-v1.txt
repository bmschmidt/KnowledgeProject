JENA, a city of the grand duchy of Saxe-W τ eimar, in Germany, the capital of a circle of the same name. It stands in a beautiful valley, through which the river Saale runs, and is surrounded with hills, whose sides are covered with vineyards. It contains three Lutheran and one Catholic church, three hospitals, and 795 houses, with about 5500 inhabitants. It is the seat of the higher courts of law of the duchy, and of some of the revenue boards. Its chief celebrity has arisen from its university, founded in 1558. The number of professors is very great, and among them have always been some oí the highest literary characters in Germany. It possesses institutions for education in physic, in mathematics, in medicine, in midwifery, in anatomy, mineralogy, surgery, veterinary practice, and a public library of more than 30,000 volumes. In consequence of a suspicion of the propagation of revolutionary principles, the number of students have, since 1818, been diminished, and now amount only to about 550. Jena is celebrated for the battle fought near it in October 1806, when Bonaparte vanquished and dispersed the Prussian army commanded by the Duke of Brunswick.
