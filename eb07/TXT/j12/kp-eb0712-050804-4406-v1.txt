JANSEN, Cornelius, bishop of Yprcs, one of the most learned divines of the seventeenth century, and principal of the sect called from his name Jansenists. He was born in Holland, of Catholic parents, and studied at Louvain. Being sent into Spain to transact some business of consequence relating to the university, the Catholic king, viewing with a jealous eye the intriguing policy of France, engaged him to write a book to expose the French as doubtful Catholics, since they made no scruple of forming alliances with Protestant states. Jansen performed this task in his Mars Gallicus, and was rewarded with a mitrc, being promoted to the see of Ypres in 1635. Before this he had maintained a controversy against the Protestants, upon the points of grace and predestination; but his Augustinus was the principal labour of his life, upon which, it is said, he spent above twenty years.
