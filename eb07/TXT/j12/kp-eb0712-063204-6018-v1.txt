JUNONALIA, a festival observed by the Romans in honour of Juno. It was instituted on account of certain prodigies which happened in Italy, and was celebrated by matrons. In the solemnity two white cows were led from the temple of Apollo into the city through the gate called Carmentalis, and two images of Juno, made of cypress, were borne in procession. Then inarched twentyseven girls, habited in long robes, singing a hymn to the goddess; next came the decemviri, crowned with laurel, in vestments edged with purple. This pompous company, proceeding through the Vicus Jugarius, performed a dance in the great field of Rome; and thence they proceeded through the Forum Boarium to the temple of Juno, where the victims were sacrificed by the decemviri, and the cypress images were left standing. This festival is not mentioned in the Fasti of Ovid, but is fully described by Livy (lib. vii. dec. 3). The hymn used upon the occasion was composed by Livius the poet.
