JACATRA, a district of the island of Java, formerly a kingdom, governed by its own sovereigns. It was subdued by the Dutch East India Companyâ€™s troops in the year 1619, who have ever since retained possession of it as sovereigns by right of conquest. Since that period Batavia has been constituted the capital. The country is watered by several rivers, which, however, are little better than rivulets in the dry season.
