JAFNA, the capital of the district of Jafnapatam. It stands at some distance from the sea, but communicates with it by a river navigable for large boats, and which falls into the sea near Point Pedro. The town is fortified, and possesses a good citadel, which, though small, is exceedingly w'ell built; but it was given up in 1795, after a short resistance, to the British troops. The situation is salubrious, and living is cheap; on which account many families have removed to this place from Columbo. The greater part of the inhabitants are of Mahommedan extraction, and are divided into several tribes, known by the names of Lubbahs, Moplays, Chittees, and Cholias. The foreign settlers arc more numerous than the native inhabitants. There are manufactures of coarse cotton cloths, calicoes, handkerchiefs, shawls, stockings, &c.; and there are also many artificers, such as goldsmiths, jewellers, joiners, and cabinet-makers.
