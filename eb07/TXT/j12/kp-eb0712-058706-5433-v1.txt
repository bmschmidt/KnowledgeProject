JOANES, Dos, a large island of South America, situated at the mouth of the river Amazons, in the province of Para. It is separated from the mainland west of the river Toccantins by the Strait of Tagyparu on the south, and extends ninety miles from north to south, and one hundred and twenty from east to west. It is one of the best peopled districts in the province; and, from its extensive grazing farms, Para, the capital, which is opposite to it, draws its chief supply of meat. The island contains many small towns and villages, and a considerable population of all castes and shades; but the Indians, who are very imperfectly civilized, are the most numerous. The climate is hot, but tempered by the ocean breeze.
