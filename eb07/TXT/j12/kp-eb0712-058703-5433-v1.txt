JOAL, a sea-port on the western coast of Africa, in the small kingdom of Bar-Sin. Formerly a considerable slave trade was carried on here; but cattle, poultry, and other provisions are what it now chiefly supplies. Very large vessels, however, cannot enter the port, on account of a sand-bank which stretches across the mouth of the harbour.
