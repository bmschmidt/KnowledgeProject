PRINCIPAL, the chief andmostnecessarypart of athing. The principal of a college or hall is the master thereof.

In commerce, principal is the capital of a sum due or lent, and is so called in opposition to interest. It also denotes the first fund put by partners into a common stock, by which it is distinguished from the calls or accessions afterwards required.

Principal, in Music, see Organ. The term principal is also used in music to designate the more distinguished part written for an instrument where there are several parts written in harmony, and where one of these parts is intended to be the chief and most conspicuous; as in a violin concerto, Violino Principale, and So of other instruments.

Principal Point, in Perspective, is a point in the perspective plane, upon which falls a line drawn from the eye perpendicular to the plane. This point, which is in the intersection of the horizontal and vertical plane, is also called the point of sight, seoú point of the eye. Principal Ray, in Perspective, is that which passes perpendicularly from the spectator’s eye to the perspective plane, or picture. The point where this ray falls upon the plane, is thence denominated by some the principal point, but other writers call it the centre of the picture, and the point of concurrence.
