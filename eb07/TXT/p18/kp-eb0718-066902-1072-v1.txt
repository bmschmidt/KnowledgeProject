PROVINCE, in Geography, a division of a kingdom or state, comprising several cities, towns, and districts, all under the same government, and usually distinguished by the extent either of the civil or the ecclesiastical jurisdiction.

The church distinguishes its provinces by archbishoprics; in which sense England is divided into two provinces, namely, Canterbury and York. ,
