PYTHIA, the priestess of Apollo at Delphi, by whom he delivered oracles. She was so called from Pythius, a name of that god, which is said to have been given him on account of his victory over the serpent Python. The Pythia was at first required to be a young girl, but in later times a woman of about fifty years of age usually officiated as priestess; The first and most famous Pythia was Phemon√∂e, by whom oracles were at first delivered in hexameter verse. All the Pythias were pure virgins, and all of them delivered their oracles with great enthusiasm and violent agitations.
