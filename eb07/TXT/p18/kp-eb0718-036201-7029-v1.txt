PONTYPOOL, a market-town of the county of Monmouth, in the parish of Trevethan, and hundred of Abergavenny, 150 miles from London. It is situated at the foot of a range of hills profusely rich in coal and iron. It was formerly celebrated for its japan ware; but that trade has been in some degree superseded by similar manufactures at Birmingham, whilst the trade in iron and coal has vastly extended, and increased the population within the last forty years. The population of the whole parish amounted in 1801 to 1472, in 1811 to 2423, in 1821 to 3931, and in 1831 to 10,280.
