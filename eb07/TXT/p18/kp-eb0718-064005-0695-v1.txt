PROBOLINGO, the capital of a district of Java, occupied by a native of China, who purchased it from the former government. He was called the China Major, and on the 18th of June 1813, was unfortunately murdered along with two British officers, Colonel Fraser of the 78th Regiment, and Captain Macpherson, who, on their way to disperse a band of insurgents, fell into an ambuscade.
