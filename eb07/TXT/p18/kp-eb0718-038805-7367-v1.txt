POOSHKUR, or Phokur, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Ajmeer, and situated on the shore of a romantic lake. It contains a remarkable temple dedicated to Brahma, with an image that has four heads and as many arms, besides other temples dedicated to Vishnu and Seva. The town contains about 700 houses, the inhabitants of which are mostly Brahmins, who depend entirely on charity for support. Here is also a mosque, built by a Mahommedan nobleman, tutor to the Emperor Akbar. It is four miles from Ajmeer.
