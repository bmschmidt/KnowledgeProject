Though the river Ribble is only navigable for small craft, yet it is connected by canals with almost every part of the kingdom, and can, by these means, easily disperse its productions in every direction. It has well-supplied markets on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. The two first are well provided with fish for the Roman Catholics, who are very numerous. The population was, in 1801, 11,887; in 1811, 17,065; in 1821, 24,557; and in 1831, 33,112; but, at the last census, the whole parish, Ï‡,'onsisting of eight other townships, contained 36,336 inhabitants.
