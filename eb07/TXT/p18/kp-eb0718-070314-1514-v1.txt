PUDSEY, a township of the west riding of Yorkshire, in the wapentake of Morley and parish of Calverly, 197 miles from London. It has an establishment settled in 1748, by a colony of Moravians from Germany, who built a village called Fulneck, from the name of the place whence they had emigrated. The large building appropriated to their use has a chapel, a dining-room, and separate divisions for the two sexes till marriage, which is said to be determined by lot. They pursue various manufacturing branches of industry. The population of the township amounted in in 1811 to 4697, in 1821 to 6229, and in 1831 to 7460.
