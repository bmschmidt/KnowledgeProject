PONIARD, a little pointed sharp-edged dagger, borne in the hand or at the girdle, or hidden in the pocket. The word is formed from the French poignard, and that from poign√©e, handful. The poniard was anciently in constant use; but it is now laid aside, except amongst assassins. Sword and poniard were the ancient arms of duellists, and are said to continue so still amongst the Spaniards. The practice of sword and poniard forms part of the exercise taught by the masters of defence.
