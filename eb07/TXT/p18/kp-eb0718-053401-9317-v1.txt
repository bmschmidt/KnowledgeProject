PRIMUM mobile, in the Ptolemaic astronomy, the ninth or highest sphere of the heavens, the centre of which is that of the world, and in comparison with which the earth is but a point. This is supposed to contain within it all other spheres, and to give them motion, turning them quite round, as well as revolving itself, in twenty-four hours.
