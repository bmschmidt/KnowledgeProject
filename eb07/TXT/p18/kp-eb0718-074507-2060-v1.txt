PYLOS, a city on the coast of MeSsenia, fifteen miles south of Cyparissia, is usually considered as the residence of Nestor, where he was visited by Telemachus. There were two other places of the same name, one in Elis, and another in Triphylia, which claimed this honour; but all the circumstances which the poet states suit best the city in Messenia. The quickness of the voyage between Ithaca and this southern Pylos is one of the principal objections; but it must be recollected that Athene’ directed the vessel. Strabo, however, believed that the city in Triphylia, which seems to have been unknown to Pausanias, w as the residence of Nestor; and he satisfied himself by the following reasoning. The description of Homer shows that the dominions of Nestor stretched on both sides of the river Alpheins; but this suits neither with Messenia nor with Elis. It was not upon the coast, for a messenger was sent to the ships to invite the companions of Telemachus to supper; and when Telemachus returned from Sparta he caused Pisistratus to drive his chariot directly to the harbour, so that the road to the harbour and city could not have been the same. The return of Telemachus to Ithaca is also brought forward as a proof, for he is made to pass Cruni, Chalcis, Pheiä, and the coast of Elis, which, according to Strabo, he could only have done if he started from the Triphylian Pylos. Again, in the war of the Pylians against the Eleiäns, the time required to drive the booty, which consisted amongst other things of swine, was so short that they could not have reached the Messenian Pylos.

Pylos, a city of Triphylia, was thirty stadia from Sarai-cum, on the coast, and near a river once called Amathus and Pamisus, but subsequently Mamaus and Arcadicus. It was considered by Strabo as the residence of Nestor.

Pylos, a city of Elis, eighty stadia from the city of Elis, was founded by Pylus of Megara, destroyed by Hercules, and rebuilt by the Eleians. It was situated between the sources of the rivers Peneius and Sellecis, and under Mount Scollis.
