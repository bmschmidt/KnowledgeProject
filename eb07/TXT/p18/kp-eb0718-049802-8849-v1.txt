POTAMON, or Potamo, was a philosopher of Alexandria. He steered a middle course between the scepticism of the Pyrrhonists and the presumption of the Dogmatists; but attached himself to none of the schools of philosophy of bis time. He was the first projector of the Eclectic sect; for though the mode of philosophising had been pretty common before, he was the first who attempted to institute a new sect on this principle. Diogenes Laertius relates, that not long betöre he wrote his Lives of the Philosophers, an Eclectic sect, eκλeκτtκ17 τιs luptσιs, had been introduced by Potamo of Alexandria, who selected tenets from every former sect. He then proceeds to quote a few particulars of his system from his Eclectic Institutes, respecting the principles of reasoning, and certain general topics of philosophical inquiry; but from these nothing further can be learned than that Potamo endeavoured to reconcile the precepts of Plato with those of other masters.
