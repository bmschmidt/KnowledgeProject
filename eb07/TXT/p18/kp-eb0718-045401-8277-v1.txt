PORTGREVE, or Portgkave, was anciently the principal magistrate in ports and other maritime towns. The word is formed from the Saxon port, a port or other town, and gercf, a governor. It is sometimes also written poÏ„t-revc. Camden observes, that the chief magistrate of London was anciently called portgreve ; but instead of him, Richard I. appointed two bailiffs; and soon afterwards John granted them a mayor as their yearly magistrate.
