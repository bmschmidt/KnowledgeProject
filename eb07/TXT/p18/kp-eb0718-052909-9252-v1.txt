PRIAM, King of Troy, was the son of Laomedon. Fie was carried into Greece after the taking of that city by Hercules; but was afterwards ransomed, upon which he obtained the name of Priam, a Greek word signifying “ransomed.” After his return he rebuilt Ilium, and extended the bounds of the kingdom of Troy, which under his reign became very flourishing. He married Hecuba, the daughter of Cisseus, King of Thrace, by whom he had nineteen children, and amongst the rest Paris, who carried off Helen, and occasioned the ruin of Troy, which is supposed to have been sacked by the Greeks about 1184 before Christ, when Priam was killed by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, at the foot of an altar, where he had taken refuge, after a reign of fifty-two years.
