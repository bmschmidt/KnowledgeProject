POLYCROTA, in the naval architecture of the ancients, a word used to express such of their galleys as had three, four,five, ormore tiersof benches, seated at different heights. TRey were distinguished by this term from the monocrotÎ±, or those which had only single rows of oars. The number of rows of benches in the polycrote galleys has given occasion to some to suppose that those vessels were of such a height above the water as is scarcely credible. Commen tators, however, are not at all agreed as to the construction of these vessels.
