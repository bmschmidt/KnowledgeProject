PURSER, an officer on board a ship of war, who receives the victuals from the victualler, sees that they be well stowed, and keeps an account of what he every day delivers to the steward. He also keeps a list of the ship’s company, and sets down exactly the day of each man’s admission, in order to regulate the quantity of provisions to be delivered out, and that the paymaster or treasurer of the navy may issue out the debasements, and pay off the men, according to his book.
