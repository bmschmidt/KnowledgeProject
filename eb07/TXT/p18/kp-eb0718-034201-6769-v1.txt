POMBAL, a city of Portugal, in the province of Estremadura, and the corregimiento of Leiria. It stands on a hill, near to which are the striking ruins of an ancient castle. It contains but one church, which is much frequented by pilgrims as well as by inhabitants, on account of a supposed holy image to which miraculous virtue is ascribed. Pombal has 860 houses, with about 4000 inhabitants, some of whom are employed in making hats. The most celebrated, or, according to some, the most profligate, statesman of Portugal, long at the head of the ministry, took his title of marquis from this place.
