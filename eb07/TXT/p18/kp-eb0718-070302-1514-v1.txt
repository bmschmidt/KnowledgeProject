PTOLEMAIS, in Ancient Geography, the port of Arsinoe, situated on the western bank of the Nile, which concurs to form the island called Nomos Heracleotes, to the south of the vertex of the Delta.

Ptolemais, the largest and most considerable town of the Thebais, or Upper Egypt, and nothing short of Memphis. It was situated on the western side of the Nile, almost opposite to Coptos. This town was built by Ptolemy Philadelphus.
