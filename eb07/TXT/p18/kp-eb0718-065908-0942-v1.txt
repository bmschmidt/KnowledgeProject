PROOF, in Law and Logic, is that degree of evidence which carries conviction to the mind. It differs from demonstration, which is applicable only to those truths of whieh the contrary is inconceivable. It differs likewise from probability, whieh produces for the most part nothing more than opinion, whilst proof produces belief.
