PRETOR, or Praetor, a magistrate amongst the ancient Romans, not unlike our Lord Chief-Justice, or Lord Chancellor, or both in one, being vested with the power of distributing justice amongst the citizens. At first there was only one praetor; but afterwards, another being created, the first or chief one had the title of praetor urbanus, or the city praetor, and the other was called praetor peregrinus, as being chief judge in all matters relating to foreigners. But, besides these, there were afterwards created many provincial praetors, who were not only judges, but also assisted the consuls in the government of the provinces, and were even invested with the government of provinces themselves.
