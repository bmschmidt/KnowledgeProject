PORTOBELLO, a parliamentary burgh, situated on the Frith of Forth, nearly three miles from Edinburgh. The town is neatly built, and as the beach is extensive, and commodious for sea-bathing, it is consequently much frequented in the summer season as a watering-place. It is not a place of trade, but has several manufactories for making bricks, tiles, and potteries, a crystal and glass work, and one or two others of less importance. The town is governed by a provost, two baillies, and six councillors; and, with Leith and Musselburgh, it returns a member to parliament. The stationary population in 1821, amounted to 1912, and in 1831, to 3170.
