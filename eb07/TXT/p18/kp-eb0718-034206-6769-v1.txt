POMOeRIUM, in Roman antiquity, was, according to Livy, that space of ground, both within and without the walls, which the augurs, at the first building of cities, solemnly consecrated, and on which no edifices were allowed to be raised. Plutarch gives this account of the ceremony of drawing the pomoerium: “They dug a trench, and threw into it the first-fruits of all things, either good by custom, [7:18:343] or necessary by nature; and every man taking a small turf of earth of the country from whence he came, they cast them in promiscuously. Then making this trench their centre, they described the city in a circle round it. After this, the founder, yoking a bull and a cow together, ploughed a deep furrow, with a brazen ploughshare, round the bounds. The attendants took eare that all the clods fell inwards, that is, toward the city. This fiιrrow they called Pomoerium, and built the wall upon it.” In this account Plutarch is to be understood as speaking of Rome.
