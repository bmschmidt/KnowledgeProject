PUNCTUM Saliens, in Anatomy, the first rudiments of the heart in the formation of the foetus, where a throbbing motion is perceived.

Punctum Stans, a phrase by which the schoolmen vainly attempt to bring within the reach of human comprehension the positive eternity of God. Those subtile reasoners seem to have discovered that nothing which is made up of parts, whether continuous or discrete, can be absolutely infinite, and that therefore eternity cannot consist of a boundless series of successive moments. Yet, as if such a series had always existed, and were commensurate in duration with the Supreme Being, they compared his eternity to one of the moments which compose the flux of time arrested in its course; and to this eternal moment they gave the name of punctum stans, because it was supposed to stand still, whilst the rest followed each other in succession, all vanishing as soon as they appeared.
