PUERTO-REAL, a city of Spain, in Andalusia, in the province or portcdo of Cadiz. It stands on the bay which takes its name from that city, and has a canal communicating with it. It is near the mouth of the river Guadalete, and is defended towards the water by some powerful batteries. It has a tolerable haven, in which there are establishments for building ships. The streets are wide and clean, and many of the houses magnificent. It contains five churches, three monasteries, a naval hospital, 1050 houses, and between 10,000 and 11,000 inhabitants. Near to it arc those great masses of salt which are produced by natural evaporation from sea-water, and with which hundreds of ships are yearly loaded to all parts of the world.
