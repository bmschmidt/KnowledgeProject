PYTHIAN Games, in Grecian antiquity, sports instituted near Delphos in honour of Apollo, on account of his slaying the serpent Python. These games, at their first institution, were celebrated only once in nine years; but afterwards every fifth year, from the number of the Parnassian nymphs who came to congratulate Apollo, and to make him presents on his victory. The victor was crowned with garlands.
