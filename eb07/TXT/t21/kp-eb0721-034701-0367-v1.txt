TRAVERSE, or Transverse, in general denotes something that goes athwart another; that is, crosses and cuts it obliquely.

T raverse, in Navigation, implies a compound course, or an assemblage of various courses, lying at different angles with the meridian.

Traverse Board, a thin circular piece of board, marked with all the points of the compass, and having eight holes bored in each, and eight small pegs hanging from the centre of the board. It is used to determine the different courses run by a ship during the period of the watch, and to ascertain the distance of each course.
