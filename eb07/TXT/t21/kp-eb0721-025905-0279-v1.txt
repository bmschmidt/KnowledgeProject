TICKELL, Thomas, an English poet, was the son of the Rev. Richard Tickell, and was born in 1686, at Bride-kirk in Cumberland. He was educated at Queen’s College, Oxford, of which he became a fellow. While he continued at that university, he addressed to Addison a complimentary copy of verses on his opera of Rosamond, which introduced him to an acquaintance with that gentleman, who, discovering his merit, became his sincere friend. On Addison being made secretary of state, he appointed Tickell his under secretary; and on his being obliged to resign that office on account of his ill health, he recommended him so effectually to Mr Craggs, bis successor, that he was continued in his post till that gentleman’s death. In 1724, Tickell was appointed secretary to the lords justices in Ireland, and enjoyed that place as long as he lived. He wrote some poems, which, when separately published, met with a favourable reception, and passed through several editions. After Mr Addison’s death, Tickell had the care of the edition of his works printed in four vols. 4to; to which he prefixed an account of the author’s life, and a poem on his death. Tickell died in the year 1740.
