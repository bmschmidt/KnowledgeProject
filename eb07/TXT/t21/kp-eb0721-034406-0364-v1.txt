TRANSIENT Notes, or Passing Notes. See Music . TRANSITION, or Modulation, in Music. See Music . TRANSITIVE, in Grammar, an epithet applied to such verbs as signify an action which passes from the subject that does it, to or upon another subject which receives it. Under the head of verbs transitive come what we usually call verbs active and passive; other verbs, whose action does not pass out of themselves, are called neuter.
