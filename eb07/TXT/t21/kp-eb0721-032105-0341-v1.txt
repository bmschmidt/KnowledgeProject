TODDINGTON, a town of the county of Bedford, in the hundred of Mamshead, thirty-seven miles from London and four from Dunstable. It had formerly a market, but it has gradually declined, and at length disappeared; but the town still has four well-attended annual fairs. The population amounted in 1801 to 1143, in 1811 to 1182, in 1821 to 1665, and in 1831 to 1926.
