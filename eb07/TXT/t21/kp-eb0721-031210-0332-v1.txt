TIPERAH, an extensive district of Bengal, situated on the eastern side of the Brahmapootra or Megna river, and between the 22d and 24th degrees of north latitude. On the north it is bounded by Silhet and Dacca; on the south by Chittagong and the sea; on the west it has the river Megna; and on the east it is divided from A va or the Birman dominions by mountains and impervious woods, abounding with wild elephants and other ferocious animals. It is estimated to contain about 7000 square miles; a considerable portion of it is wild and desolate, and thinly inhabited by the Kookies, a savage race. The eastern division is productive, yielding abundant crops of rice and cotton; and a quantity of salt is also manufactured on the sea-coast on account of government. It devolved to the British in 1765, along with the rest of Bengal. Population 750,000, in an equal proportion of Hindoos and Mahommedans.
