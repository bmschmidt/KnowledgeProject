THEOPOMPUS, a celebrated Greek orator and historian, was bom in the island Chios, and flourished in the reign of Alexander the Great. He was one of the most famous of all the disciples of Isocrates, and won the prize from all the panegyrists whom Artemisia invited to praise Mausolus. He wrote several works, which are lost.
