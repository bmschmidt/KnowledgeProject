TENIERS, David, the elder, a Flemish painter, born at Antwerp in 15S2, received the first rudiments of his art from the famous Rubens, who highly esteemed him for his promising genius, and with great satisfaction examined and commended his designs. From the school of that celebrated painter Teniers went to finish his studies at Rome. He attached himself to Adam Elsheimer for six years; and from the instructions of two such incomparable masters, he formed to himself a peculiar style, which his son afterwards cultivated so happily as to bring it to the utmost perfection. His pictures were small; and his subjects usually shops, laboratories, humorous conversations, and rural festivities. The demand for his pieces was universal; and even his master Rubens thought them an ornament to his cabinet. He died at Antwerp in 1640.
