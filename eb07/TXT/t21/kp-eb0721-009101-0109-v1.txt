TATE, Nahum, a poet and dramatist, the son of Dr Faithful Tate, was born in Dublin in the year 1652. He was educated in Trinity College, but did not betake himself to any profession. Upon the death of Shadwell in 1692, Tate succeeded him as poet laureat, and held that place until the reign of George I. whose first birth-day ode he lived to write, and executed it with unusual spirit. He died in the Mint in 1716. He was the author of ten dramatic performances, a great number of poems, and a version of the Psalms in conjunction with Dr Brady. A list of his plays may be found in the Biographia Dramatica, vol. i. p. 703.
