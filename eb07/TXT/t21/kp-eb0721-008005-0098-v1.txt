TAREM, a town of Persia, in the province of Laristan, situated in a plain on the banks of a salt river. It is a meanly built place, consisting of a mud fort, surrounded on all sides by wretched huts, but is populous, and contains many respectable merchants, who trade to Muscat, Gombroon, and Shiraz.
