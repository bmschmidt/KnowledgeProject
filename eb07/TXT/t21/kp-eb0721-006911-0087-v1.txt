TAGLIACOZZI, Gasparo, a renowned surgeon, was born at Bologna in the year 1546. He studied in that university under Cardan, and took his doctor’s degree at the age of twenty-four. He was appointed professor of surgery, and afterwards of anatomy; and after having acquired much reputation, he died at Bologna on the 7th of November 1599. His principal work is entitled “De Curtorum Chirurgia per Insitionem libri duo.” Venet. 1597, fol. It was reprinted under the title of “Chirurgia nova, de Narium, Aurium, Labiorumque Defectu per Insitionem Cutis ex Humero, arte hactenus omnibus ignota, sarciendo.” Francof. (1598), 8vo. This new title sufficiently indicates the art which he professed, of repairing noses, ears, and lips, by a species of ingrafting. The name of Taliacotius is well known to the readers of Hudibras.
