TANK, in the language of Hindustan, a place enclosed for receiving and retaining rain-water. During the periodical rains the tanks are filled, and thus in the dry season furnish water for the rice-fields and cattle. Some of them are of great extent, measuring 300 or 400 feet on the side. They are of a quadrangular form, and lined with granite, descending in regular steps from the margin to the bottom.
