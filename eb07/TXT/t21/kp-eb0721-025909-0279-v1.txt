TIDES.

Τηε alternate rising and falling which are observed to take place in the surface of the waters, generally twice in the course of a lunar day, or of 24 h ∙ 49 m ∙ of mean solar time, on most of the shores of the ocean, and in the greater part of bays, firths, and rivers which communicate freely with it, are the phenomena denominated the tides. These form what are called a flood and an ebb, a high and low water. The whole interval between high and low water is called a tide; the water is said to flow and to ebb; and the rising is called the flood tide, and the falling the ebb tide. This rise or fall of the waters is exceedingly different at different places, and is also variable everywhere. At Plymouth, for instance, it is sometimes twenty feet between the greatest and least heights of the water in one day, and sometimes only twelve feet. These different heights of tide succeed each other in a regular series, diminishing from the greatest to the least, and then increasing from the least to the greatest. The greatest is called a spring tide, and the least a neap tide. This series is completed in about fifteen days. More careful observation shows that two series arc completed in the time of a lunation. For the spring tide in any place happens at a certain interval of time, generally between one and two days, after new or full moon; and the neap tide at a certain interval after the quarter: or, more accurately speaking, the spring tide occurs when the moon has got a certain number of degrees eastward either from the line of conjunction with the sun or of opposition to him, and the neap tide when she is at a certain distance from her first or last quadrature. Thus the whole series of tides appears to be chiefly regulated by the moon, and seems to be only to a small extent under the influence of the sun; for it is further observed that high water happens when the moon has nearly a certain position with respect to the meridian of the place of observation, preceding or following the moon’s southing by a certain interval of time; which, at new and full moon, is generally not far from being constant with respect to the same place, but very different in different places; whereas the interval between the time of high water and noon changes almost everywhere about six hours in the course of a fortnight.

The interval between two succeeding high waters is variable. It is shortest about new and full moon, being then about 12 h ∙ 19 m ∙; and about the time of the moon’s quadra-ratures it is 12 h ∙ 30 m ∙ But these intervals are somewhat different at different places. The tides in similar circumstances are greatest when the moon is in the equator, and at her smallest distance from the earth, or in her perigee; and, gradually diminishing, are smallest when she is in her apogee, and farthest from the equator.

Such are some of the more general and regular phenomena of the tides. In certain places there are four tides in the lunar day, in others but one; and in some there is scarcely any perceptible variation of level, which regularly keeps time with the moon. The tides being important to all commercial nations, great exertions have recently been made to obtain the means of predicting them. Some account [7:21:260] of these and other empirical researches, which have of late been conducted on an extensive scale and with great care, will be given in the latter part of this article.

It is of tides, most probably, the Bible speaks, when God is said to set bounds to the sea, and to say, “thus far shall it go, and no farther.” Homer would be the earliest profane author who notices the tides, if indeed it be to them he refers (in the 12th book of the Odyssey) when he speaks of Charybdis rising and retiring thrice a day. Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus speak more distinctly of the tides in the Red Sea. Pytheas of Marseille is the first who says any thing of their cause. According to Strabo, he had been in Britain, where he must have observed the tides of the ocean. Plutarch says expressly that Pytheas ascribed them to the moon. It is remarkable that Aristotle says so little about the tides. The army of Alexander, his pupil, were startled at first seeing them near the Persian Gulf; and Aristotle would probably be well informed of all that had been observed there. But in all his writings there are only three passages concerning them, and these are very trivial. In one place he speaks of great tides in the north of Europe; in another, of their having been ascribed by some to the moon; and in a third, he says, the tide in a great sea exceeds that in a small one.

The Greeks had little opportunity of observing the tides. The conquests and the commerce of the Romans gave them more acquaintance with them. Caesar speaks of them in the fourth book of his Gallic War. Strabo, after Posidonius, classes the phenomena into daily, monthly, and annual. He observes, that the sea rises as the moon approaches the meridian, whether above or below the horizon, and falls again as she rises or falls; that the tides increase at the time of new and full moon, and are greatest at the summer solstice. Pliny explains the phenomena at some length, and ascribes them to the sun and moon dragging the waters along with them (b. ii. c. 97). Seneca (Nat. Quest, iii. 28) speaks of the tides with correctness; and Macrobius (Somn. Scip. i. 6) gives a tolerable description of their motions. Such phenomena naturally exercise human curiosity as to their cause. Plutarch (Placit. Phil. iii. 17), Galileo (Sgsr. Mund. dial. 4), Riccioli in his Almagest, ii. p. 374, and Gassendi, ii. p. 27, have collected most of the notions of their predecessors on the subject; but they are of so little importance as not to deserve our notice. Kepler, in accounting for the tides (De Stella Martis, and Epit. Astron. p. 555), had evidently been aware of the principle of gravitation, but not of the law. He says that all bodies attract each other, and that the waters of the ocean would all go to the moon were they not retained by the attraction of the earth. He then proceeds to explain their elevation under the moon and on the opposite side, because the earth is less attracted by the moon than the nearer waters, but more than the waters which are more remote. The honour of a complete explanation of the tides in a general way was reserved for Sir Isaac Newton. He laid hold of this class of phenomena as the most incontestable proof of universal gravitation, and has given a most beautiful and synoptical view of the whole subject; contenting himself, however, with merely exhibiting the chief consequences of the general principle, and applying it to the phenomena with singular address.

The investigation of the phenomena of the tides has been justly considered as uniting some of the greatest difficulties that occur in the various departments of natural philosophy and astronomy. It implies, first, a knowledge of the laws of gravitation, concerned in the determination of the forces immediately acting on the sea, and of the periods and distances of the celestial bodics, which modify the magnitudes and combinations of these forces; and, secondly, of the hydraulic theories of the resistances of fluids, and of the motions of waves and undulations of all kinds, and of the theoretical determination of the form and density of the earth, as well as of the geographical observation of the breadth and depth of the seas and lakes which occupy a part of its surface; so that the whole subject affords abundant scope for the exercise of mathematical skill, and still more for the employment of that invention and contrivance which enables its possessor to supersede the necessity of prolix com· putations wherever they can be avoided.

The history of the theory of the tides is naturally divided into several periods in which its different departments have been progressively cultivated. The ancients from the times of Posidonius and Pytheas, and the moderns before Newton, were contented with observing the general dependence of the tides on the moon, as following her transit at an interval of about two hours, and their alternate increase and decrease not only every fortnight, but also in the lunar period of about eight years. The second step consisted in the determination of the magnitude and direction of the solar and lunar forces, by which the general effects of the tides were shown, in the Principia, to be the necessary consequences of these forces. The third great point was the demonstration of Maclaurin, that the form of an elliptic spheroid affords an equilibrium under the action of the disturbing forces concerned; while the further contemporary illustrations of the subject by Euler and Bernoulli, though they afforded some useful details, involved no new principle that can be put in competition with Maclaurin’s demonstration. The fourth important step was made by Laplace, who separated the consideration of the form affording mere equilibrium, from that of the morion occasioned by the continual change of that form; while former theorists had taken it for granted that the surface of the sea very speedily assumed the figure of a fluid actuated by similar forces, but remaining perfectly at rest, or assuming instantly the form in question. Laplace’s computation is however limited to the case of an imaginary ocean, of a certain variable depth, assumed for the convenience of calculation, rather than for any other reason. Dr Thomas Young has extended Laplace’s mode of considering the phenomena to the more general case of an ocean covering a part only of the earth’s surface, and more or less irregular in its form; he has also attempted to comprehend in his calculations the precise effects of hydraulic friction on the times and magnitudes of the tides. As far as the resistance may be supposed to vary in the simple ratio of the velocity, Dr Young’s theory is sufficiently complete, and explains several of the peculiarities which are otherwise paradoxical in their appearance; but there still remains a difficulty to be combated with respect to the effects of a resistance proportional to the square of the velocity, and this, it is hoped, will be in great measure removed in the present article, which, however, from the space that is allotted to it, must be considered rather as a supplementary fragment than as a complete treatise. This theory will be divided into four sections: the first relating to the contemporaneous progress of the tides through the different seas and oceans, as collected from observation only; the second to the magnitude of the disturbing forces tending to change the form of the surface of the earth and sea; the third to the theory of compound vibrations with resistance; and the fourth to the application of this theory to the progress and successive magnitudes of the tides, as observable at any one port.

Sect. I— Of the Progress of Contemporary Tides, as inferred from the times of High Water in different Ports.

The least theoretical consideration relating to the tides, is that of their progress through the different parts of the ocean, and of its dependent seas. The analysis of these ought to be very completely attainable from direct observation[7:21:261], if the time of high water had been accurately observed at a sufficient number of ports throughout the world; and, on the other hand, if the earth were covered in all parts with a fluid of great and nearly uniform depth, the tides of this fluid would be so regular, that a very few observations would be sufficient to enable us to deduce the whole of the phenomena from theory, and to trace the great waves, which would follow the sun and moon round the globe, so as to make its circuit in a day, without any material deviation from uniformity of motion and succession. Having collected, for the actual state of the sea and continents, an abundant store of accurate observations of the precise time of high water with regard to the sun and moon, for every part of the surface, and having arranged them in a table according to the order of their occurrence, as expressed in the time of any one meridian, we might then suppose lines to be drawn on a terrestrial globe, through all the places of observation, in the same order; and these lines would indicate, supposing the places to be sufficiently numerous, so as to furnish a series of tides very nearly contemporary, the directions of the great waves, to which that of the progress of the tides in succession must be perpendicular. If, however, we actually make such an attempt, we shall soon find how utterly inadequate the observations that have been recorded are, for the purpose of tracing the forms of the lines of contemporary high water with accuracy or with certainty, although they are abundantly sufficient to show the impossibility of deducing the time of high water at any given place from the Newtonian hypothesis, or even from that of Laplace, without some direct observation. It might at least be supposed very easy to enumerate the existing observations, scanty as they may be, in a correct order; but there is a number of instances in which it is wholly uncertain whether the time observed at a given port relates to the tide of the same morning in the open ocean, or to that of the preceding evening. This inconvenience may, however, in some measure be remedied, by inserting such places in two different parts of the table, at the distance of twelve and a half hours from each other. The following table is the result of an approximation obtained in this manner, the principal hour-lines having been partially traced on a map of the world, in order to afford some little direction to the correct insertion of the times of high water without the material error of half a day.

Time of High Water at the Full and change of the Moon, reduced to the Meridian of Greenwich.
[table]
[7:21:262]

It may be immediately inferred from this table, first, that the line of contemporary tides is seldom in the exact direction of the meridian, as it is supposed to be universally in the theory of Newton and of Laplace; except, perhaps, the line for the twenty-first hour in the Indian Ocean, which appears to extend from Socotora to the Almirantes and the Isle of Bourbon, lying nearly in the same longitude. Secondly, the southern extremity of the line advances as it passes the Cape of Good Hope, so that it turns up towards the Atlantic, which it enters obliquely, so as to arrive, nearly at the same moment, at the Island of Ascension, and at the Island of Martin Vaz, or of the Trinity. Thirdly, after several irregularities about the Cape Verd Islands, and in the West Indies, the line appears to run nearly east and west from St Domingo to Cape Blanco, the tides proceeding due northwards; and then, turning still more to the right, the line seems to run north-west and south-east, till at last the tide runs almost due east up the British Channel and round the north of Scotland into the Northern Ocean, sending off a branch down the North Sea to meet the succeeding tide at the mouth of the Thames. Fourthly, towards Cape Horn, again, there is a good deal of irregularity; the hour-lines are much compressed between South Georgia and Tierra del Fuego, perhaps on account of the shallower water about the Falkland lslands and South Shetland. Fifthly, at the entrance of the Pacific Ocean, the tides seem to advance very rapidly to New Zealand and Easter Island; but here it appears to be uncertain whether the line of contemporary tide should be drawn nearly north and south from the Gallapagos to Tierra del Fuego, or north-east and south-west from Easter Island to New Zealand; or whether both these partial directions are correct: but on each side of this line there are great irregularities, and many more observations are wanting before the progress of the tide can be traced with any tolerable accuracy, among the multitudinous islands of the Pacific Ocean, where it might have been hoped that the phenomena would have been observed in their greatest simplicity, and in their most genuine form. Lastly, of the Indian Ocean the northern parts exhibit great irregularities, and among the rest they afford the singular phenomenon of one tide in the day, observed by Halley in the port of Tonkin, and explained by Newton in the Principia: the southern parts are only remarkable for having the hour-lines of contemporary tides considerably crowded between New Holland and the Cape of Good Hope, as if the seas of these parts were shallower than elsewhere.

These inferences respecting the progress of the tides are not advanced as the result of any particular theory, nor even as the only ones that might possibly be deduced from the table. Thus the supposion that the direction in which the tides advance must be perpendicular to the hour-lines of contemporary tides, is not by any means absolutely without exception, since a quadrangular lake, with steep shores in the direction of the meridian, would have the times of high water the same for every point of its eastern or western halves respectively, and there could be no correctly defined direction of the hour-lines in such a case. But if any portion of the sea could be considered as constituting such a lake, its properties would be detected by a sufficient number of observations of high water; and the existing table does not appear to indicate any such cases that require to be otherwise distinguished than as partial irregularities. There may also be some doubt respecting the propriety of the addition of twelve and a half hours that has been made to the time of high water in the north-eastern parts of the Atlantic: but it seems extremely improbable that the same tide should travel north-easterly into the English Channel and into the Northern Ocean, and at the same time westerly across the Atlantic, as it must be supposed to do, if it were considered as primarily originating in the neighbour hood of the Bay of Biscay. On the other hand, the bending of the great wave round the continents of Africa and Europe seems to be very like the sort of refraction which takes place on every shelving coast with respect to the common waves, which, whatever may have been their primitive origin, acquire always, as they spread, a direction more and more nearly parallel to that of the coast which they are approaching: and the suppositions which have been here advanced respecting the succession of the tides in different ports, allowing for the effect of a multitude of irregularities proceeding from partial causes, appear to be by far the most probable that can be immediately inferred from the table, at least in its present state of imperfection.

Sect. II.— Of the Disturbing Forces that occasion the Tides.

Since the phenomena of the tides, with regard to their progress through the different oceans and seas, as they exist in the actual state of the earth’s surface, appear to be too complicated to allow us to hope to reduce them to computation by means of any general theory, we must, in the next place, confine our attention to the order in which the successive changes occur in any single port; and having determined the exact magnitude of the forces that tend to change the form of the surface of the ocean at different periods, and having also examined the nature of the vibratory motions of which the sea, or any given portion of it, would be susceptible, in the simplest cases, after the cessation of the disturbing forces, we must afterwards endeavour to combine these causes, so as to adapt the result to the successive phenomena which are observed at different times in any one port.

Theorem A. (“E.”—Nicholson’s Journal, July 1813.) The disturbing force of a distant attractive body, urging a particle of a fluid in the direction of the surface of a sphere, varies as the sine of twice the altitude of the body.

The mean attraction exerted by the sun and moon on all the separate particles composing the earth, is exactly compensated by the centrifugal force derived from the earth’s annual revolution round the sun, and from its monthly revolution round the common centre of gravity of the earth and moon; but the difference of the attractions exerted at different points of the earth, must necessarily produce a disturbing force, depending on the angular position of the point with regard to the sun or moon, since the centrifugal force is the same for them all; the disturbing force being constantly variable for any one point, and depending partly on the difference of the distance of the point from the mean distance, and partly on the difference of the direction of the luminary from its direction with respect to the centre, or, in other words, on its parallax.

In the case of a sphere covered with a fluid, it will be most convenient for computation to consider both these forces as referred to the direction of the circumference of the sphere, which will differ but little from that of the fluid; and it will appear that both of them, when reduced to this direction, will vary as the product of the sine and cosine of the distance from the diameter pointing to the luminary, that is, as half the sine of twice the altitude: for the difference of gravitation, which depends on the difference of the distance, will always vary as the sine of the distance from the bisecting plane perpendicular to that diameter, and will be reduced to the direction of the surface by diminishing it in the ratio of the cosine to the radius; and the effect of the difference of direction will be originally proportional to the sine of the distance from the diameter, and will in like manner be expressed, when reduced, by the product of the sine and cosine; and each force, thus reduced, will be equal, where it is greatest, to half of its primitive magnitude, since sin. cos. 45° = ½. “Thus, the gravitation towards the [7:21:263] moon at the earth’s surface, is to the gravitation towards the earth as 1 to 70 times the square of 60½, or to 256 217: and the former disturbing force is to the whole of this as 2 to 60½ at the point nearest the moon, and the second as 1 to 60½ at the equatorial plane, and the sum of both, reduced to the direction of the circumference, where greatest, as 3 to 121, that is, to the whole force of the earth’s gravitation, as 1 to 10 334 000; and in a similar manner we find, that the whole disturbing force of the sun is to the weight of the particles as 1 to 25 736 000.” Or, if we call the moon’s horizontal parallax p, and substitute 1 / p for the distance, the whole of the lunar disturbing force in the direction of the surface will be 3 / 2 · ***** = 3 / 140 p 3 ; or, if z be the moon’s zenith distance from any point of the surface, f = 3 / 70 p 3 sin. cos. z. Theorem B. [F.] The inclination of the surface of an oblong spheroid, slightly elliptical, to that of the inscribed sphere, varies as the sine of twice the distance from the circle of contact; and a particle resting on any part of it, without friction, may be held in equilibrium by the attraction of a distant body [situated in the direction of the axis].

If a sphere be inscribed in an oblong spheroid, the elevation of the spheroid above the sphere must obviously be proportional, when measured in a direction parallel to the axis of the spheroid, to the ordinate of the sphere, that is, to the sine of the distance from its equator; and when reduced to a direction perpendicular to the surface of the sphere, it must be proportional to the square of that sine; and the tangent of the inclination to the surface of the sphere, which is equal to the fluxion of the elevation divided by that of the circumference, must be expressed by twice the continual product of the sine, the cosine, and the ellipticity, or rather the greater elevation e , the radius being considered as unity: so that the elevation e will also express the tangent of the inclination where it is greatest, since 2 sin. cos. 45° = 1; and the inclination will be everywhere as the product of the sine and cosine.

If, therefore, the density of the elevated parts be considered as evanescent, and their attraction be neglected, there will be an equilibrium, when the ellipticity is to the radius as the disturbing force to the whole force of gravitation; for each particle situated on the surface will be actuated by a disturbing force tending towards the pole of the spheroid, precisely equal and contrary to that portion of the force of gravitation which urges it in the opposite direction down the inclined surface. Hence, if the density of the sea were supposed inconsiderable in comparison with that of the earth, the radius being 20 839 000 feet, the greatest height of a lunar tide in equilibrium would be 2·0166 feet, and that of a solar tide ·8097: that is, supposing the moon’s horizonal parallax about 57', and her mass 1 / 70 of that of the earth.

Theorem C. [G.] The disturbing attraction of the thin shell contained between a spheroidical surface and its inscribed sphere, varies in the same proportion as the inclination of the surface, and is to the relative force of gravity depending on that inclination, as three times the density of the shell to five times that of the sphere.

We may imagine the surface of the sphere to be divided by an infinite number of parallel and equidistant circles, beginning from any point at which a gravitating particle is situated, and we may suppose all these circles to be divided by a plane perpendicular to the meridian of the point, and consequently bisecting the equatorial plane of the spheroid: it is obvious, that if the elevations on the opposite sides of the plane be equal at the corresponding points of each circle, no lateral force will be produced; but when they are unequal, the excess of the elevated matter on one side above that of the other side will produce a disturbing or lateral force. Now, the elevation being everywhere as the square of the distance x from the equatorial plane, we may call it ex 2 , and the difference corresponding to any point of that semicircle which is the nearer to the pole of the spheroid, will be e (x' 2 — x'' 2 ) = e (x'+ x") (x'— x''). But x' + x'' is always twice the distance of the centre of the supposed circle from the equatorial plane; and the distance of this centre from that of the sphere will be cos. ψ, if ψ be the angular distance of the circle from its pole; and calling φ the distance of this pole from the equatorial plane of the spheroid, the distance in question will be cos. ψ sin. φ, and x' + x" =2 cos. ψ sin. φ ; and the difference x' — x'' is twice the actual sine of the arc θ in the supposed circle, that is, twice the natural sine, reduced in the ratio of unit to the radius of this circle, which is sin. ψ. reduced again to a direction perpendicular to the equatorial plane; whence x' — x'' = 2 sin. θ sin. ψ cos. φ ; and x' 2 — x'' 2 = 4 sin. θ sin. cos. ψ sin. cos. φ. Hence it follows, that, in different , positions of the gravitating particle, the effective elevation at each point of the surface, similarly situated with respect to it, is as the product of the sine and cosine of its angular distance φ from the equatorial plane, the other quantities concerned remaining the same in all positions. But the inclination of the surface of the spheroid, as well as the original disturbing force, varies in the same proportion of the product of the sine and cosine of the distance φ ; consequently the sum of this disturbing attraction and the original force will also vary as the inclination of the surface, and may be in equilibrium with the tendency to descend towards the centre, provided that the ellipticity be duly commensurate to the density of the elevated parts.

Now, in order to find the actual magnitude of the disturbing attraction for a shell of given density, we must compute the fluent of 4 e sin. θ d θ sin. cos. ψdψ sin. cos. φ, reduced first according to the distance and direction of each particle from the given gravitating particle; and we must

4

compare the fluent with 4 / 3 π, the attraction of the whole sphere at the distance of the radius, or unity. But for the angle 6, the portion of the force acting in the common direction of sin. θ is to the whole attraction at the same distance as sin. θ to 1, so that the attractive force of any point of the semicircle will be 4 e sin. 2 6 sin. cos. ψ sin. cos. φ, and its fluxion will be as sin. 2 θ d θ , of which the fluent is ½ θ — ½ sin. cos. θ, or when θ = 180°, ½π, and ½π sin. ψ will express the effect of the disturbing attraction of the semicircles, of which sin. ψ is the radius, reduced to the direction of the middle point, of which the distance is 2 sin. ½ψ; the reduction for this distance is as its square to 1; and for the direction, as the distance to sin. ψ, together making the ratio of ******* — 8 .*"* , t ∙, and the ultimate fluxion of the

Now, taking the fluent from ψ = 0 to ψ = 180°, we have 2∕ , cos. 4 ⅛ψ2d∣ψ = ∣ , ∣, and∕ ’ cos. 3 ⅛4 × 2d∣ψ = ∣, the difference[7:21:264] being 3 / 5 · 4 / 3 = 4 / 5 , whence the fluent of the force is found 2 eπ sin. cos. φ × 4 / 5 × 1 / n , calling the density of the fluid 1 / n , or, where it is greatest, sin. cos. φ being = ½, 4 / 5 eπ / n , while the attraction of the sphere itself is 4 / 3 π , which is 4 / 5 eπ / n as 1 to 3 e / 5 n ; and since the elevation e expresses also the maximum of the relative force of gravity depending on the tangent of the inclination (Theorem B), it is obvious that the disturbing attraction 3 e / 5 n must be to the relative force e as 3 / n to 5.

Corollary 1. If n= 1, as in a homogeneous fluid sphere or spheroid, the disturbing attraction becomes 3 / 5 e , and this attraction, together with the primitive force f , must express the actual elevation e , or 3 / 5 e + f = e, whence f = 2 / 5 e , and e = 5 / 2 f , giving 2·024 and 5∙042 for the magnitude of the solar and lunar tides, when f = ∙8097 and 2∙0166 respectively. But this is obviously far from the actual state of the problem.

Corollary 2. Supposing n = 5∙4 (see Quarterly Journal of Science, April 1820), we have 3 e / 27 + f =e, and e = 27 / 24 f = 9 / 8 f ; so that the height of the primitive tides of an ocean of water, covering the whole surface of the earth, such as it actually is, ought to be ∙911 for the solar, and 2∙27 for the lunar disturbing force; that is, supposing the sen without inertia, so as to accommodate itself at once to the form of equilibrium. But, in the actual state of the irregularities of the seas and continents, it is impossible to pay any regard to this secondary force, since the phenomena do not justify us in supposing the general form of the surface of the ocean such as to give rise to it.

Theorem D. [H.] When the horizontal surface of a liquid is elevated or depressed a little at a given point, the effect will be propagated in the manner of a wave, with a velocity equal to that of a heavy body which has fallen through a space equal to half the depth of the fluid, the form of the wave remaining similar to that of the original elevation or depression. Dr Young’s Elementary Illustrations of the Celestial Mechanics of Laplace, 378, p. 318.

Scholium. The demonstration of this theorem implies that water is incompressible, and that the pressure of each particle placed on the surface is instantaneously communicated through the whole depth of the fluid to the bottom. These suppositions are not indeed strictly accurate in any case, but they introduce no sensible error when the surface of the wave similarly affected is large in comparison with the depth of the fluid. A modern author of celebrity seems to have taken it for granted that the pressure is propagated with the same velocity downwards and laterally; at least, if such is not his meaning, he has been somewhat unfortunate in the choice of his expressions; but there seems no reason whatever why water should communicate force more slowly when it is perfectly confined, than ice would do; and the divergence of the pressure of a certain portion of the surface of water, elevated a little, for example, above the rest, may be compared to the divergence of a sound entering into a detached chamber by an aperture of the same size with the given surface, which is probably small in comparison with its direct motion, but equally rapid, and in both cases depending on the modulus of the elasticity of the medium.

Theorem E. [I.] A wave of a symmetrical form, with a depression equal and similar to its elevation, striking against a solid vertical obstacle, will be reflected, so as to cause a part of the surface, at the distance of one fourth of its whole breadth, to remain at rest; and if there be another opposite obstacle at twice that distance, there may be a perpetual vibration between the surfaces, the middle point having no vertical motion. Dr Young’s Natural Philosophy, vol. i. p. 289, 777.

Scholium 1. The elevation and depression of a spheroid, compared with the surface of the sphere of equal magnitude, exhibits a symmetrical wave in the sense of the proposition; and it is not necessary that the shores should be very rocky or perpendicular, in order to produce a strong reflection; for even the vibration of the water in the bottom of a common hemispherical basin is considerably permanent.

Corollary 3. The vibrations of the water supposed to be contained in a canal, following the direction of the equator, and 90° in length, would be synchronous with the passage of a wave 180° in breadth, over any point of a canal of the same depth, and surrounding the whole globe.

Scholium 2. It has been usual to consider the elevation of the tides as identical with that of an oblong spheroid, measured at its vertex, and therefore as amounting to twice as much as the depression of the same spheroid at the equator, considered in relation to the mean height belonging to a sphere of the same magnitude; but the supposition is by no means applicable to the case of a globe covered partially and irregularly with water, so that in almost all cases of actual tides, the elevation must be considered as little if at all greater than the depression, as far as this cause only is concerned; there are, however, some other reasons to expect that the elevation of the great wave might often arrive at a distant port in somewhat greater force than the depresssion.

Theorem F. [K.] The oscillations of the sea and of lakes, constituting the tides, are subject to laws exactly similar to those of pendulums capable of performing vibrations in the same time, and suspended from points which are subjected to compound regular vibrations, of which the constituent periods are completed in half a lunar and half a solar day [or in some particular cases a whole day].

Supposing the surface of the sea to remain at rest, each point of it would become alternately elevated and depressed, in comparison with the situation in which it might remain in equilibrium; its distance from this situation varying according to the regular law of the pendulum (see Theorem B); and, like all minute vibrations, it will be actuated by forces indirectly dependent on, and proportional to, this distance; so that it may be compared to a pendulous body remaining at rest in the vertical line, about which its point of suspension vibrates, and will consequently follow the motion of the temporary horizon, in the same manner as the pendulum follows the vibration of its point of suspension, either with a direct or a retrograde motion, according to circumstances, which will be hereafter explained: the operation of the forces concerned being perfectly analogous, whether we consider the simple hydrostatic pressure depending on the elevation, or the horizontal pressure derived from the inclination of the surface, or the differential force immediately producing elevation and depression, depending on the variation of the horizontal pressure, and proportional to the curvature of the surface. It becomes therefore necessary, for the theory of the tides, to investigate minutely the laws of these compound and compulsory vibrations, which, together with the resistances affecting them, will be the subject of the next section.
