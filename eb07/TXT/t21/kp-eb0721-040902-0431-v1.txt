TUPTEE, a considerable river of Hindustan, formed by the union of numerous streams. It has its source near the village of Batool, among the Injardy Hills, whence it pursues a westerly course through the provinces of Khandesh and Gujerat, until it falls into the sea about twenty miles below Surat. It has a bending course of 500 miles, through a fertile country, which produces much of the cotton that is exported from Surat and Bombay.
