TANGERANG, a village of the island of Java, about fifteen miles west from Batavia. A large weekly bazaar is held here, to which the produce of the adjacent country is brought, and thence carried to Batavia. There is also a river of the same name, which falls into the ocean about twenty miles west of Bantam.
