TYPE (ruro;), an impression, image, or representation of some model, which is termed the antitype. In this sense the word frequently occurs in the writings of divines, who employ it to denote that prefiguration of the great events of manâ€™s redemption, which they trace in the principal transactions recorded in the Old Testament.

Type, the stamps used in printing, for the purpose of impressing the characters upon paper. They usually consist of a right-angled shaft, with the character in relief upon the upper end; but in the general term are included the spaces, quadrats, &c. which are shafts merely without any characters, and which, being of less height than the rest, receive no ink and make no impression upon the paper.
