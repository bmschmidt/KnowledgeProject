TERCERA, one of the largest of the Azores, or Western Islands, lying in the Atlantic Ocean. It is about forty miles in circumference, and is surrounded with craggy rocks, which render it almost inaccessible. The soil is fertile, abounding in corn, wine, and fruits; and the inhabitants have plenty of cattle to supply the ships that touch there. Their principal trade is in wood. The inhabitants are lively, addicted to gallantry, and are said to be extremely revengeful. It is subject to Portugal, and Angra is the capital town. Long. 27. 1. W. Lat. 28. 45. N.
