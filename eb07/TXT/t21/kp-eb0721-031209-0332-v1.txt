TINTERN, a village of the county of Monmouth, in the hundred of Ragland. It stands on the banks of the river Wye, in a most picturesque situation, about five miles above Chepstow. Tintern is much visited on account of the remains of its abbey, which present, in good preservation, a view of the ecclesiastical architecture of the twelfth century. It was founded for Cistertian monks in the year 1131, and the ruins of its church still show a most striking view of beauty and grandeur. Its appearance by moonlight is peculiarly enchanting. In 1831 the village contained 313 inhabitants, who are employed in making iron wire. The excursion by water on the Wye to this place is very pleasing, either from Monmouth or from Chepstow.
