Tiara is also the name of the popeâ€™s triple crown. The tiara and keys are the badge of the papal dignity; the tiara of his civil rank, and the keys of his spiritual jurisdiction. As soon as the pope is dead, his arms are represented with the tiara alone, without the keys. The ancient tiara was a round high cap. John XXIII. first encompassed it with a crown. Boniface VIII. added a second crown, and Benedict XII. a third.
