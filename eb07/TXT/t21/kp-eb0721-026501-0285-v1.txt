THEOREM G. If d w + Ads + Bs d s + D w ds = 0, we have e Ds (w + B / D s + AS-B / DD ) = c ; hl e being = 1.

Scholium. For the better understanding of the mode of investigation which will be employed in these propositions, it will be proper to premise some remarks on the investigation of fluxional equations, by means of multipliers. A person unacquainted with the language of modern mathematicians, would naturally understand by a “criterion of integrability,” some mode of distinguishing an expression that would be integrated, from one that was untractable; while, in fact, this celebrated criterion relates only to the accidental form in which the expression occurs, and not to its essential nature. If we take, for instance, the well-known case of the fluxion of hl x / y = hl x — hl y , we have dx / x - dy / y = ydx-xdy / xy , and making this = 0, we have also ydx— xdy = 0; and this expression no longer fulfils the conditions of integrability, until we multiply it again by —, and restore it to its perfect form. The direct investigation of such a multiplier is generally attended by insuperable difficulties; and the best expedient, in practical cases, is to examine the results of the employment of such multipliers as are most likely to be concerned in the problem, with indeterminate co-efficients, and to compare them with the equations proposed. In common cases, the finding of fluents, when only one variable quantity is concerned, requires little more than the employment of a table of fluents or integrals such as that of Meier Hirsch; and the truth of the solution is in general tested at once, for each case, by taking the fluxion of the quantity inserted in the table: but for the separation of different variable quantities, where they are involved with each other, the employment of proper multipliers is one of the most effectual expedients; and it is still more essential to the solution of equations between fluxions of different orders, or their coefficients. Such equations require in general to be compared with some multiple of the exponential quantity e mt , which affords fluxions of successive orders, that have simple relations to each other, especially when d t is considered as constant. The multiples of sin. Ct, and cos. Ct, are also very useful in such investigations, and for a similar reason; but the solutions that they afford are commonly less comprehensive than the former, though they are often simpler, and more easily obtained. It is not however necessary that the exponent of the multiplier should flow uniformly, as will appear from the first example of a problem which has been solved by Euler in his Mechanics: the subsequent examples will possess somewhat more of novelty.

Demonstration. The fluxion of e η, (w 4- ps 4- 7) is e η, (dw + pds 4- (nw 4- nps 4- nq) ds) = e π * dw -∣- (p -∣- nj) ds 4- ndsds 4- nwds); and comparing with this e"* (dw 4- Ads 4- Bsds 4- Duals), we have n = D, np = B, and B B 1 , 1 A P P-~ ~^∩' and > last ∙y> P + nq = A, q = ——-t- — AD—Β , . λ . .. π. ∕ B —∩j,~i consequently the fluxion of e (w + 7) i 4. -jj-∣j —) is equal to nothing, and that quantity is constant, or equal to c. Example. Let the given equation be that of a cycloidal pendulum, moving with a resistance proportional to the „ , 1 . dds _ r , ds 2 λ square of the velocity, or 4- Bs — D = 0.

Scholium 2. The space s being supposed to begin at the lowest point of the curve, the fluxion ds is negative during the descent on the positive side, and the force dd s is consequently negative, and equal, when there is no resistance, to Bs, B being a positive co-efficient, equivalent, in the case of gravitation, to 2g / l or 32 / l , l being the length of the pendulum, and g the descent of a falling body in the first second. The co-efficient — D is negative, because the resistance acts in a contrary direction to that of the force Bs, as long as s remains positive, and coincides with it on the negative side. But in the return of the pendulum the signs are changed, so that the equation can only be applied to a single vibration; since the two forces in question oppose each other in the same points of the curve in which they d^2

before agreed, while the square must always remain positive.

Solution. If we multiply the given equation by ds, and make the square of the velocity, or eo sc ttr = -^ 5 , we ddç dç 2 have ds ≡⅛ 4- Bsds — D ^ds = 0 = 4dw4- Bsds— di 2 dt i i 1 Dwds, and dιc 4- 2Bsds — 2Dwds = 0; which, compared with the theorem, gives us 0 for A, 2B for B, and — 2D for D; and the solution becomes cc ir,s ; and if 10 = 0 when s = λ, we have λ 4- +

corollary 1. From this solution we obtain the point at which the velocity is greatest; and, by reversing the equation, we may also find the extent of the vibration. For when dw = 0, we have Bs d s = Dw d s, and Bs = Dw, which is the obvious expression of the equality of the resistance[7:21:266] to the propelling force. Putting the greatest value of w = x, and the corresponding value of * = ς, we have x = B , B 1 2Dι t> Γi 1 B D t + 2lΓD +ce =D c ∙ s,nce Bl = Dx ’ and 2DD = -ce- o ∙=f^ e 2 *> ('-*>; whence 1 = e 2 O('~ λ ), ZL)D γ and y — e 2D ( λ ; consequently hl7 — 2D (λ — ς) = hl

The proof of this well-known formula is the most readily obtained by means of a series with indeterminate co-efficients, such as x = Az + Bz 2 +..., which, by actual in volution, and by comparison with the proposed series, will give the required values of the co-efficients, as expressed in this Lemma.

corollary 2. When w = 0, we obtain from its value, 2 1 divided by Bσ, the equation 2 λ = γσ - 2 / 3 - Dγσ + 1 / 3 D 2 γσ 3 — ...; and, by reversing this series, we have ***** <r= — + s^^+^^...,or ff =2K-∣D λ * + ... 5 the difference ,of the arcs of descent and ascent being 4 / 3 Dλ 2 , and the difference of two successive vibrations 8 / 3 Dλ 2 , when the resistance is very small; this difference being also 8 / 3 ; so that the displacement of the point of greatest velocity is 3 / 8 of the difference of the successive vibrations.

Scholium 2. If K be the value of w when Die would be equal to the force of gravity, and DK = Bl = 2g, we have D = 2G / K , or H being the height from which a body must fall to acquire the velocity √K, since K = 4 gH , D = ½ H , and 2 D = 1 / H .

Scholium 3. It is natural to imagine that we might obtain the time from the equation expressing the velocity in terms of the space, if we merely expanded the value of into a new series, by means of the Newtonian theorem; but the fluents thus obtained for the expression of the time are deficient in convergency; and a similar difficulty would occur if we expressed σ in terms of w by reversing the series, and divided its fluxion by √w. The ingenuity of Euler has, however, devised a method of avoiding these inconveniences, by supposing the time to begin at the point where the velocity is a maximum; and it will be necessary, in this investigation, to follow his steps, with some slight variations.

corollary 3. In order to find the time of vibration, we take —i = r,andx — w= z, thens = r 4- j, β=zλ—i— r, w =2⅛< 1 -∕ e-8ncλ ~'~^ + + 0). ««J »

Theorem H. If *****4. Λ 4- Us = 0, dt being constant[7:21:267], we have e*" ’ (ds 4- σsdt) = c; m being — ⅜√4 z⅛z √(j∕l∙ — B), and a = ⅜√4 =p V(⅛A ’ ∙ — B). Demonstration. The fluxion of e m, (ds 4- α.rd∕) is e mt mt

(d⅛ 4- <zdsdf -(- (mds 4- owιsd')dz) = e (d 2 s 4- (a 4- m) dsdZ 4- amsdt 3 ); and, comparing this fluxion with the proposed equation, we have, for the co-efficients, a 4- m = A, and am = Β; whence im = A, m 2 — Am = — Β, m = ⅜ J ± √(∣A j — B), and a = ⅛A = f ^∕()A 2 — IT). Example. Let the equation proposed be that of a cycloidal pendulum, vibrating with a resistance proportional to the velocity; that is, — 4- A 4- Bs = 0.

Scholium 1. The resistance is here adequately expressed, in all cases, by the term A ds / dt so that the equation is permanently applicable to the successive vibrations. Thus, in the second descent, on the negative side of the vertical line, lis being negative, and — s becoming nearer to 0, the fluxion ds is positive, and A ⅛ is of a contrary character to Βs, as it ought to be.

Solution. Since m = ½ A ± √ (¼ A 2 — B), and a = ½ A ± √ (¼ A 2 — B) , it is obvions that the two radical quantities will be either possible or imaginary, according as ¼ A 2 is greater or less than B. Case i. If A 2 is greater than 4 B , the resistance being very considerable, the solution becomes ******e 4 " ~ - + [P =F - *)]«) = «:

Corollαrg 1. Hence it appears that such a pendulum would require an infinite time to descend to the lowest point, since the velocity cannot have a finite value when s vanishes, the exponential quantity never beginning negative.

Scholium 2. The co-efficient B may also be written for *****

authors by ⅛g, or even by ∖g. If we make 4- y » = 0; when s — l, the force becomes such that — d⅛ = 32d< 2 , and — ⅛ = 32, which is the true velocity generated by such a force in a second of time. Supposing h to be the velocity with which the resistance would become equal to the weight, we must have for ^∣p ^∕^ ^ t ∣ z ' ∙ n order that the force represented by A may become equal to that of gravity, and A = ψ; and if Λ be the height from which a bo<ly *****Jl~ ⅛QQ Q must fall to gain the velocity h, since h = -.A t = ~ =

We have seen that, for a resistance varying as the square of the velocity, this proportion was as 8 to 3, or as 2∙667 to 1.

corollary 5. If the pendulum be supposed to vibrate in a second, the unity of time, the diminution of the arc 2λ in each vibration will be ½ A × 2λ, and the successive lengths will vary as *****e - 2λ, e~ A 2λ, and so forth; and after the number N of vibrations, the extent of the arc will be reduced from 2λ to ***** e - ^ ka 2λ; so that if we make ***** e — W a

Scholium 3. Although the isochronism of a pendulum, with a resistance proportional to the velocity, was demonstrated by Newton, yet Euler appears to have failed in his attempts to carry the theory of such vibrations to perfection; for he observes (Mechan. ii. p. 312), Etsi ex his appareat, tempora tam ascensuum quam descensuum inter se esse aqualia, tamen determinari non potest, quantum sit tempus sive descensuum sive ascensuum: neque etiam tempora descensuum et ascensuum inter se possunt comparari. Aequatio enim rationem inter s et u definiens ita est complicata, ut ex ea elementum temporis ds / u , per unicam variabilem non possit exprimi. Scholium 4. In confirmation of the solution that has been here proposed, it may not be superfluous to show the truth of the result in a different manner. Taking ****** s= ςe mt cos. ct, we have = te mt (rn cos. ct — c sin. ct), and = ic ml (m 3 cos. ct — Cm sin. ct — cm sin. ct — c 3 cos. ct); whence + A -∣- Bs = ςe m, (m 3 co3. ct — 2 cm sin. ct — c i cos. ct -fAm cos. Ct— Ac sin. ct -∣- B cos. ci) — 0, and (m 2 — C s -∣- Am q- B) cos. ct— (2Cm -f- Ac) sin. Ci = 0: an equation which is obviously true when the co-officients of both its terms vanish, and 2C m = — Ac, or m = ∣.4; and again c i = m s + Am -∣- B = ∣ A 3 — ∣ A* -∣- B = B — I A 3 . The former mode of investigation is more general, and more strictly analytical; but this latter is of readier application in more complicated cases, and it will hereafter be further pursued.

Lemma. If a moveable body be actuated continually by a force equal to that which acts on a given pendulum, the body being in a state of rest when the pendulum is at the middle of its vibration, the space described in the time of a vibration will be to the length of the pendulum as the circumference of a circle is to its diameter. For the force being represented by cos. Ct, or cos. x, for the pendulum, it will become sin. x with regard to the beginning of the supposed motion, and the velocity, instead of sin. x, becomes— cos. x, or 1 —cos. x; so that the space, instead of 1 — cos. x, is x — sin. x, which, at the end of the semivibration, is x = instead of 1 — cos. x = 1, the space described by the simple pendulum, which is equal to its length.

Scholium 5. There is a paradox in the relations of the diminution of the vibration to the distance measuring the greatest resistance, which it will be worth while to consider, in order to guard ourselves against the too hasty adoption of some methods of approximation which appear at first sight unexceptionable. The pendulum, if it set out from a state of rest at the point of greatest resistance, would perform a vibration to the extent of double the distance of that point, or 2 λ, the initial force being measured by that distance. Now, when the resistance is very small, its magnitude may be obtained without sensible error from the velocity of the pendulum vibrating without resistance at the corresponding part of the arc; and the velocity may be supposed to vary as sin. Ct, and the resistance, in the case of this proposition, as sin. ct or sin. x also. Hence it may be inferred by means of the Lemma, that the whole diminution of the space will be to A / √ B λ as π to 1, or that it will be equal to - A / √ B π λ, which has already [7:21:269] been found to be the actual difference of two successive semivibrations. The accuracy of this result, however, must depend on the mutual compensation of its errors; for the approximation supposes, that if the resistance vanished at the lowest point, the subsequent retardation would be such as to diminish the space by the effect of the diminution of the velocity acting uniformly through the remainder of the vibration, while in fact the diminution of the space from this cause would be simply equal to a part of the arc proportional to the diminution of the velocity, since the arc of ascent is simply as the velocity at the lowest point. Hence it is obvious, that the effects of the resistance are too much complicated with the progress of the vibration to allow us to calculate them separately; and accordingly, when the resistance is as the square of the velocity, or as sin. 2 x, the diminution of velocity is expressed by ½ x - ½ sin. cos. x, and that of the space by ¼ x 2 — ¼sin. 2 x, which, at the end of a vibration, becomes ¼ π 2 instead of π ; that is, since the distance of the point of greatest velocity is here ς = Dλ 2 , ¼ π 2 Dλ 2 = 2∙467 Dλ 2 , while the more accurate mode of computation has shown that the true diminution of the space is 2∙667 D λ 2 . (Theorem G.) If we chose to pursue the mode of approximation here suggested, with accuracy, it would be necessary to consider the resistance as a periodical force acting on a pendulum capable of a synchronous vibration, as hereafter in Theorem K, Schol. 1.

—„„ — 5 - sin. Ft = — M sin. Ft. II — ιi Corollary 1. If, in order to generalize this solution, we make s = α sin. √Bt + β cos. √Bt + γ sin. Ft + ε cos. Ft, we may take any quantities at pleasure for α and β , according to the conditions of the particular case to be investigated; but ε must be = 0; that is, the motion will always be compounded of two vibrations, the one dependent on the length of the pendulum, or on the time required for the free vibration, indicated by √ Bt, the other synchronous with Ft, the period of the force denoted by M; the latter only being limited to the condition of beginning and ending with the periodical force.

corollary 2. In the same manner, it may be shown that the addition of any number of separate periodical forces, indicated by the terms M ' sin. Ft, M" sin. F''t, .. ., will add to the solution the quantities M' / F'F'-B sin. M'' / F''F''-B sin. F''t, and so forth.

Example 1. Supposing a pendulum to be suspended on a vibrating centre, and to pass the vertical line at the same moment with the centre, we may make α and β = 0, and s = M / FF-B sin. Ft only; the vibration being either direct or reversed, according as F is less or greater than

√ B , or than √ 32 / l , which determines the spontaneous vibration of the pendulum.

Example 2. But if the ball of the pendulum be supposed to begin its motion at the moment that the centre of suspension passes the vertical line, we must make s = M / FF-B (sin. Ft — cos. √ Bt), and the subsequent motion of the pendulum will then be represented by the sum of the sines of two unequal arcs in the same circle; and if these arcs are commensurate with each other, the vibration will ultimately acquire a double extent, and nearly disappear in a continued succession of periods, provided that no resistance interfere. And the consequences of any other initial conditions may be investigated in a manner nearly similar. Thus, if the time of free vibration, under these circumstances, were 1 / 3 of the periodical time, the free vibration, in which the motion must be supposed initially retrograde, in order to represent a state of rest by its combination with the fixed vibration, would have arrived at its greatest excursion forwards, after three semivibrations, at the same moment with the fixed vibration, and after three complete vibrations more would be at its greatest distance in the opposite direction, so as to increase every subsequent vibration equally on each side, and permanently to combine the whole extent of the separate arcs of vibration. But in this and in every other similar vibration, beginning from a state of rest in the vertical line, that is, at the point where the periodical force is evanescent, the effect of the free or subordinate vibration with respect to the place of the body will obviously disappear whenever an entire number of ιsemi-vibrations has been performed.

corollary 3. The paradox stated in the fourth scholium on the last theorem may be illustrated by means of this proposition, and will serve in its turn to justify the mode of computation here employed in a remarkable manner. It has been observed in Nicholson’s Journal for July 1813, that the mode of investigating the effects of variable forces, by resolving them into parts represented by the sines of multiple arcs, and considering the vibrations derived from each term as independent in their progress, but united in their effects, may be applied to the problem of a pendulum vibrating with a resistance proportional to the square of the velocity; and that for this purpose the square of the sine may be represented by the series sin. 2 x = ∙8484 sin. x — ∙1696 sin. 3 x — ∙0244 sin. 5x— ∙00813 sin. 7x — ∙0029 sin. 9x—∙0013 sin. 11 x—... Now, if we employ this series for resolving the resistance supposed in Theorem G into a number of independent forces, the greatest resistance being measured by A / √ B λ , we shall have ·8484 A / √ B λ for the part supposed to be simply proportional to the velocity, whence, from Theorem H, we have ∙8484 π A / √ B λ for the corresponding diminution of the vibration; that is,

2∙6653 A / √ B λ . But it has been observed, in the preceding corollary, that the place of the pendulum will not be at all affected by any subordinate vibration after any entire number of complete semivibrations; and the slight effect of the velocity left in consequence of these subordinate vibrations may here be safely neglected, so that 2∙6653 A / √ B λ may be considered as the whole effect of the resistance with respect to the space described, which differs only by 1 / 2000 of [7:21:270] the whole from 2∙666 A / √ B λ , the result of the more direct computation of Theorem G.

Scholium. An experimental illustration of the accuracy of the theorem may be found in the sympathetic vibrations of clocks, and in that of the inverted pendulum invented by Mr Hardy, as a test of the steadiness of a support (art. Pendulum, vol. xvii. p. 218); for since the extent of the regular periodical vibration is measured by M / FF-B , it is evident, that however small the quantity M may be, it will become very considerable when divided by FF— B, as F and √B approach to each other; and accordingly it is observed, that when the inverted pendulum is well adjusted to the rate of a clock, there is no pillar so steady as. not to communicate to it a very perceptible motion by its regular, though extremely minute, and otherwise imperceptible change <>f place.

Supposing B to approach very near to G 2 , a case very likely to occur in nature, because the effects which are produced, where it is found, will predominate over others, on account of the minuteness of the divisor; we may neglect the part of the denominator (G 2 — B) 2 , in comparison with A 2 G 2, , and the co-efficient determining* will then become M / AG , the extent of the vibrations being inversely as A the co-efficient of the resistance; and, indeed, when the whole force of the periodical vibration is expended in overcoming a resistance proportional to the velocity, it may naturally be imagined that the velocity should be inversely as the resistance. It follows also from G the proposition, that in this case the arc ta. AG / B-GG approaching to a quadrant, the greatest excursions of the periodical motion and of the free vibration will differ nearly one fourth of the time of a complete vibration from each other.

Scholium 2. Since s is a line, and B its numerical coefficient, making it represent a force, and since sin. Gt is properly a number also, the co-efficient M, both here and in Theorem J, must be supposed to include another linear co-efficient, as μ, which converts the sine into a line, to be added to s , the distance from the middle point: that is, M must be considered as representing Bμ, in which μ is the true extent of the periodical change of the centre of suspension, and B = 2g / l , as in other cases; so that M is = 2g / l μ = 32 μ / l , and μ = Ml / 2g = 1 / 32 Ml. Corollarg. In order to obtain a more general solution of the problem, we may combine the periodical motion thus determined with the free vibrations, as computed in Theorem H, the different motions, as well as the resistances, being totally independent of each other; but the most interesting cases are those which are simply periodical, the free vibration gradually diminishing with the multiplier e -mt , and ultimately disappearing.

For, the equations expressing the space described being simply linear, the different motions and resistances are added or subtracted without any alteration of the respective relations and effects.

Lemma. For the addition of the arcs a and b, beginning with the wcll-known equation sin. (α=+zZ∣) = sin. a cos. b ∑±= sin. b cos. a, we have, by addition, sin. (a -j- b) -∣- sin. (a— b)-ii sin. α cos. b, and sin. a cos. b = ⅜ sin. (a + i) -∣- ⅜ sin. (α — b). Then, if c = b + 90°, cos. ⅛ = sin. c, whence sin. a sin. c = I sin. (a -jc — 90°) + ⅜ sin. (a — c + 90°); but sin. (i∙ + 90°) = cos. x and sin. (x — 90°) = — cos x, consequently sin. a sin. c = ∣ cos. (a — c)— ∣ cos. (a + c).
