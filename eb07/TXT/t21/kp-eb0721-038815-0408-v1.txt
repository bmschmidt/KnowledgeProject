TROAS, a country of Phrygh, in Asia Minor, of which Troy was the capital. When Troas is taken for the whole kingdom of Priam, it may be said to contain Mysia and Phrygia Minor; but if it is taken for that part of the country where Troy was situated, its extent is confined within very narrow limits. Troas was anciently called Dardania.
