TRIO, or Terzetto, in Music, a composition for three voices or for three instruments. Among the most striking instrumental trios are those by Mozart and Beethoven for violin, viola, and violoncello, and for pianoforte, violin, and violoncello, &c. The term trio is also applied to a movement in Â¾th time, which often follows the minuet in a piece of instrumental music.
