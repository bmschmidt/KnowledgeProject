TRIGONOMETRY.

1. TRIGONOMETRY is a branch of the mathematics which treats of the relations of the sides and angles of triangles, these being expressed by numbers. It is therefore a theory formed by the union of arithmetic and geometry, and it treats of a particular class of geometrical figures, namely, triangles.

There are two kinds of triangles considered in trigonometry; plane triangles, and spherical triangles. The former are figures on a plane, and the latter on the surface of a sphere; hence we have plane trigonometry and spherical trigonometry, the principles of which will be explained in succession. In a triangle there are six things which may be considered, viz. the three sides, and the three angles. The main object of the theory is to give rules by which, when some of these are given, the others may be found.

2. The application of numbers to express the sides and angles of triangles has given rise to several terms which require to be defined before we proceed further.

DEFINITIONS.

I. Since angles at the centres of equal circles have to each other the same ratio as the arcs on which they stand, the arcs may be taken as representatives or measures of the angles to which they are proportional. Thus, let ACB be any angle contained by the lines AC, BC: if about C as a centre, with any distance or radius AC, a circle ABE be described, the arc AB, intercepted between the lines CA, CB, is the measure of the angle ACB.

II. The circumference of every circle is supposed to be divided into 360 equal parts called degrees, and again each degree is subdivided into 60 equal parts called minutes, and each minute into 60 equal parts called seconds; and an angle is said to be of as many degrees, minutes, seconds, &c. as there are degrees, and minutes, and seconds in its measure. The degrees in any arc or angle are indicated by the character o placed over their number, the minutes by an accent ', and the seconds by two accents ". For example, an angle of 25 degrees 12 minutes and 14 seconds is expressed thus, 25° 12' 14''—A right angle is measured by one fourth part of the circumference, or a quadrant, and it contains 90°.

III. The complement of an arc or angle is the difference between it and a quadrant, or 90°. Thus, supposing AD to be a quadrant, the arc BD is the complement of the arc AB, and the angle BCD is the complement of the angle ACB.

IV. The supplement of an arc or angle is its difference from half the circumference, or 180°. Let ADE be a semicircle; the arc BDE is the supplement of the arc AB; and the angle BCE is the supplement of the angle ACB.

V. The sine of an arc or angle is the perpendicular drawn from one extremity of the arc, on the diameter, that passes through the other extremity. The line BF is the sine of the arc AB, or of the angle ACB.

VI. The versed sine is the segment of the diameter between its sine and the arc which measures the angle. The line AF is the versed sine of the arc AB, or the angle ACB, and EF the versed sine of the angle BCE.

VII. The tangent is a straight line that touches the arc at one end, and is limited at the other end by a straight line drawn from the centre of the circle through the other extremity of the arc. The line AH is the tangent of the arc AB, or the angle ACB.

VIII. The secant is the straight line drawn from the centre to the extremity of the tangent. The line CH is the secant of the arc AB, or angle ACB.

IX. The sine, tangent, and secant, of the complement of any arc or angle, are called by abbreviation its cosine , cotangent, and cosecant. Thus, BG = CF, the sine of the arc BD, is the cosine of the arc AB; and DK, the tangent of the arc BD, is the cotangent of AB; and CK, the secant of BD, is the cosecant of AB.

Trigonometrical Notation.

The sine of an angle whose measure is A, is expressed thus, sin. A ; its cosine by cos. A ; its tangent by tan. A; its cotangent by cot. A; its secant by sec. A; its cosecant by cosec. A; its versed sine by ver. siri. A; and its coversed sine by co. νer. sin. A.

The radius of a circle, when it is supposed the unit of numbers, requires no symbol: sometimes it is represented by the abbreviation rad. and also by the letter R.

3. There are two ways in which the theories of trigonometry have been established. One is by employing a process of reasoning purely geometrical, such as has been followed in our article Geometry. In this way the early writers on the subject constructed their treatises, and it served very well for plane triangles, but was less convenient for spherical triangles, by reason of the intricate diagrams required to represent circles lying in different planes; and also by the complicated relations of the things to be discussed, which could not easily be expressed by words. The second, which is the more convenient way, is by the symbolic reasoning of algebra. The section in Algebra on the Arithmetic of Sines is a specimen of this way of treating the subject; and it is worthy of remark, that the great extension that has been given to the subject is in no small degree due to the simple and convenient way of representing the sines and tangents, &c. of angles, by the abbreviations, sin. A, tan. A, &c. instead of referring to the geometrical lines themselves. As a consequence of this, geometrical constructions are avoided, and even diagrams are hardly necessary.

4. In applying the notation and doctrines of modern analysis to trigonometry, we regard the measures of angles, and their sines, tangents, &c. as endowed with the properties of variable quantity; in particular, we ascribe to them the quality of being positive or negative. The consequences of this hypothesis have been fully detailed in the Arithmetic of Sines (Algebra), to which we refer the reader. By this the properties of triangles are expressed by general formulae, which comprehend all particular cases. This way of considering the numeral measures of trigonometrical lines has greatly simplified spherical trigonometry, and all applications of both trigonometries to astronomy and geodetical inquiries.

The Trigonometrical Table.

5. The basis of all trigonometrical calculations is a table which exhibits in parts of the radius the numeral values of the sine, tangent, and secant, of each arc in a series pro [7:21:371] ceeding from 0 to a quadrant, the common difference of the terms being an angle of one minute, or some smaller angle.

The radius being considered as an unit, the sines are expressed as decimal fractions of that unit. The quadrant is generally divided into degrees and minutes, this being sufficient for most purposes; but tables have been calculated which give the sines, and tangents, and secants, to every tenth second.

6. The Elements of Euclid show how to inscribe regular polygons of three, four, five, six, and fifteen sides in a circle. The sides of these polygons may be expressed in numbers by calculations derived from the geometrical constructions. Now, the side of an equilateral triangle in a circle, is the chord of 120°, which is twice the sine of 60°; and the side of the inscribed square is the chord of 90°, which is twice the sine of 45°; and the side of the equilateral pentagon is the chord of 72°, which is twice the sine of 36°; and the side of the hexagon is the chord of 60°, which is twice the sine of 30°; and the side of the quindecagon is the chord of 24°, which is twice the sine of 12°. These sines may therefore be all deduced from the properties of polygons inscribed in a circle, as delivered in the Elements. And since the sum of the squares of the chord of an arc and the chord of its supplement is equal to the square of the diameter (Geom. 17 of 2 and 13 of 4), the chords of the supplements, and thence the sines of their halves, may be found. It was in this way the trigonometrical table was first constructed by the early mathematicians, Purbach, Miiller, Copernicus, G. Joachimus Rhaeticus, and others. The theory of inscribed polygons was extended by Vieta into that of angular sections, chiefly with a view to the construction of the table. This has again been wrought up into the Arithmetic or calculus of Sines, the formulae of which afford great facility in the construction of the table. As an example, we shall resolve this problem.

7. Problem. To find the sines of one fifth, two fifths, three fifths, and four fifths, of a quadrant, of which the sine is equal to the radius. Putting a to denote an arc of 18°, one fifth of the quadrant, we are to find the sines of a , 2 a, 3 a , 4 a . Now, from the nature of the problem, we have these simple relations:

*******Cos. a = sin. 4 a , cos. 2α = sin. 3«,

Cos. 3« = sin. 2a, cos. 4a = sin. a.

And by formula 3 of (E) art. 240, Algebra,

Sin. 2α = 2 sin. a cos. α,

Sin. 3a — 2 sin. 2a cos. a — sin. a,

Sin. 4a = 2 sin. 3a cos. a — sin. 2σ,

Sin. 5a = 2 sin. 4a cos. a — sin. 3«.

Therefore Sin. 2σ = 2 sin. a sin. 4a,

Sin. 3a = 2 sin. 2a sin. 4a — sin. a,

Sin. 4a = 2 sin. 3a sin. 4a — sin. 2zz,

Sin. 5⅛ = 1 = 2 sin. 4a sin. 4a — sin. 3a.

To abridge, put sin. a = ιι, sin. 2a = x, sin. 3a — y, sin. 4a = r, and we have the following equations:

2«z = X A, 2xz = y + u B, 2gz = z + X C,

2zz = 1 + y................ D.

These express symmetrical relations, which connect the four sines w, x, y, z.

By subtracting A from C, and dividing the remainder by 2z, we have y —« = J (i).

And from B, A, D; y + u = 2xz = 4ι<a* = 2a + 2ιιy. Therefore 2uy = y — « = ⅜; 5 and hence, (y + w) 2 = (y— u) 2 + 4uy =

and y + u = yt (2).

We have now, by subtraction and addition from (1) and (2),

V5 — 1. v ’ 5-4-l sin. α — w — — , sin. 3a = y — ÷ j —.

+ z r

Now' the arcs a and 4o being the complements of each other, also 3a and 2a, and the sum of the squares of the sine and cosine being equal to the square of the radius, we have ein. 2« = « = √(1 — y ’) - √(10-∙g√¾), ⅛,⅛=,⅛√(l-⅛) = << ll, + i ^>

Our problem is now resolved.

8. We have found the sines of a series of arcs from 0 to 90°, viz. 18°, 36°, 54°, 72°, whichdiffer by 18°. From these, the sines of a series whose terms differ by 9°, may be found by formulae, which are modifications of formulae (1), (2) of (P), article 249, Algebra, viz.

sin. I (90° — a) = t f- ~∙^ ln ' ", sin. ⅜ (90° + α) =

The terms intermediate to those known are,

. no /1 —sin.72° . /1 +sin. 36°

sm. 9° = J g > sln ∙ 63 = √ ÿ , o*o— /’ — sin. 36° . ∕l÷βin. 72“

sin. 2.° = J , sin. 81° = J , sin. 45° = yi.

By a second interpolation the number of terms in the series would be doubled, and by a third, the sines of a series of arcs which are multiples of 2° 15' would be found. In the same way, from sin. 30° = ½, sin. 60° = — , and sin. 90° = I, we may deduce the sines of 15°, 45°, 75°; and at length the sines of a series of arcs, which are multiples of 3° 45'; then, from the two series, another, the arcs of which would differ by (3° 45') — (2° 15') = 1° 30' = 90'; and again the sines of a series of arcs differing by 45'. Indeed it was in this way the table was first formed.

9. When the sines of two thirds of the quadrant, that is, from 0 to 60°, are known, the sines of the remaining third can be readily found; for since sin. (a + b ) = sin. (a — b ) + 2 cos. a sin. b (Algebra, art. 240), if we make a = 60°, then cos. a = ½, and 2 cos. a = 1, and we have sin. (60° + b) — sin. (60° — b) + sin. b. By this formula the numbers in the table may be verified.

The radius being an unit, we have found that the semi-circumference or arc of 180° = 3·1415926535 (Algebra, article 272). This number divided by 180 × 60 = 1080, gives the arc which measures an angle of one minute = ·0002908882; and since a small arc is nearly equal to its sine, we have sin. 1'=∙0002908882 nearly. The accuracy of this may be verified by the formula ******Qp cP sin. a = a — — + —- —, &c. (Algebra, art. 269).

The cosine of one minute is found from the sine by the formula cos. α = √(1 — sin. 2 a), or otherwise, by the series cos. a — 1 — —, &c. ≡ ∙9999999577. Knowing now the sine and cosine of one minute, to find the sines of 2', 3', 4’, &c. we may proceed thus,—

Sin. 2' — 2 cos. 1' sin. Γ,

Sin. 3' = 2 cos. 1' sin. 2' — sin. P, Sin. 4' = 2 cos. 1' sin. 3'—sin. 2 ’, &c.

10. Since the results obtained by the successive operations[7:21:372] are only approximations, they will diminish in accuracy as we advance. We may however proceed otherwise thus. Find, as has been explained, a series of sines of arcs differing by 45' from 0° to 60°; then fill up, by interpolation, the intervals thus: We have found (Algebra, art. 239) *********sin. (a + l>) + sin. (α — ⅛) = 2 .cos. b sin. a: instead of a write x + h, and instead of 6 write h, and we have sin. lx + 2∕ι) + sin. x = 2 cos. h sin. (* + Λ).

, , A s , P h β

Now cos. Ä = 1 — τ - 5 + — — -.- j-.∙. γ - g» &c ·

Γ2 l∙2∙3∙4 l∙2∙o∙4∙5∙o h* h 6

Putn to denote the series h- —∙ - + - , —-, — &c. and U*T m‘4'0’0 we have sin. (.1· + 2A) + sin. x = 2 sin. (.r + h) — n sin. (x + A); and sin. lx + 2Λ) = sin. (r + A) + (sin. (r + A) —sin.a:) — n sin. lx ⅛ A). If A be an arc of one minute, then A = ∙0002908882, and n — ∙t)000000846. Let x denote any angle, and suppose A to be one minute; the formula gives sin. (a: + l') = sin. x + (sin. x — sin. lx — Γ))

— n sin. X, sin. lx + 2') = sin. lx + Γ) + (sin. lx + l') — sin.

— n sin. (a· + l').

sin. lx + 3') =sin. (® + 2') + (sin. lx+ i 2')— sin.(≈+ Γ))

— n sin. lx + 2').

Thus, from the sines of two arcs x— 1' and x , which differ by 1', and the constant number n = 2 ( 1 —cos. l') = (2 sin. 30'') 2 , the sines of all angles or arcs exceeding x, and differing by l', throughout the table, may be found. The most extensive table of sines in existence (which is yet in manuscript), was computed under the direction of the late Μ. Prony in this way. It gives the sines of all arcs in a series of which the common difference is one ten-thousandth part of a quadrant with twenty-five decimals.

11. The sines being found, the tangents and secants may be obtained, each by a single division from the formulae tan. a = sin. a / cos. a , sec. a = 1 / cos. a .

The tangents of the latter half of the quadrant may however be found by addition only from the formula tan. (45° + a) = tan. (45° — a ) + 2 tan. 2rr, which is a deduction from (4) of (O) Algebra, art. 248; and the secants from this formula, sec. a = tan. a 4- tan. (45° — ½ a ), Algebra, 249.

12. With a table of sines, and tangents, and secants, the ordinary questions relating to triangles may be resolved by multiplication and division, but more expeditiously by logarithmic calculation; and therefore, in general, mathematical tables give only the logarithmic sines, tangents, and sometimes secants, which, however, may be readily found from the log. cosines.

Part I.— Plane Trigonometry.

13. In contemplating a plane triangle as a figure formed by three straight lines, we distinguish the sides of the triangle, the angles at their intersections, and the space or area which they comprehend. In trigonometry we abstract from the area, and consider only the sides and angles. There are in all six angles, viz. the three interior and their adjacent exterior angles. Each of the exterior is the sum of two interior angles, and of these any two determine the third; so that in fact the independent elements of a triangle are five, viz. its three sides, and any two of its three interior angles; and of these any three being given, the remaining two may be found.

14. The sides and angles are dissimilar in their nature, and therefore do not admit of being directly compared: the measures of angles, being arcs of a circle described with a given radius, are lines, and therefore expressible by the sides. It is however more convenient and easy to use the sines and tangents, &c. of angles than the angles themselves, in trigonometrical calculations, the rules of which are to be deduced from the following theorems.

***********Τηεοrεμ I. In any right-

angled triangle, the radius is to the sine of either of the acute angles as the hypotenuse is to the side opposite that angle. (Fig· 2.)

Let ABC be a right-angled triangle, of which B is the right angle; about C, one of the acute angles, as a centre, with a radius equal to the radius in the tables, describe an arc DE as the measure of the angle C (Def. 1). Draw DP, the sine of the arc DE (Def. 5). The triangles CDF, CAB are manifestly equiangular, therefore their sides are proportionals; so that CD: DF ≡ CA: AB, or (putting R to denote radius in the tables) R: sin. C = CA: AB.

Corollary 1. The radius is to the cosine of either of the oblique angles as the hypotenuse is to the side adjacent to that angle, l∙ , or. to the radius CD, CP is the cosine of C, and CD: CF = CA: CB.

CorMιu∕ 2. Assuming that CD = R = 1, we have

1: sin.' C = CA: A B: and 1: cos. C = CA: CB. Therefore, suj>posing the sides of the triangle expressed by numbers,

. r , AB CB

CA CA

***********THEOREM II. In any right-angled triangle, the radius is to the tangent of either of the oblique angles as the adjacent side to the opposite side. (Fig. 2.)

At the point E, one extremity of the arc DE which measures the angle C, draw EG perpendicular to CB; then to the radius CE, EG is the tangent of the angle C (Def. 7). Now the triaiιg!es CEG, ABC being similar, CE: EG = CB: BA, or R: tan. C = CB: BA.

corollary 1. The radius is to the secant of either of the oblique angles as the adjacent side to the hypotenuse; for CG is the secant of the angle C (Def. 8); and CE: CG = CB: CΛ, or R: sec. C = CB: CA.

corollary 2. Assuming the radius = 1, then

**********f οrοllary 3. In any triangle, if a perpendicular be drawn from any one of the angles to t)>e opposite side, the segments of that side are to one another as the tangents of the parts into which the opposite angle is divided by the perpendicular. r

For in the triangles ADB, ADC,

BD: DA = tan. BAD: R; and DA: DC = R: tan. CAD. Therefore, ex aquali, BD: DC — tan. BAD; tan. CAD.
[7:21:373]

Theorem III. In any right-angled triangle, the sum of the hypotenuse and one side is to their difference, as thç square of the radius to ψe s<pιare of the tangent of half the contained angle.

Let ABC be any right-angled triangle; draw CD bisecting the angle C. By Geom. 19, 4,

CAtCB = AD :BD = AB —BD: BD.

Therefore, by composition, and Cor. 3 of Theor. II. of Tr!g.

C A + CB: CB ≡ Λ B: BD = tan. C: tan. ’ C. Now CB: BA = R: tan. C, therefore CA 4- CB: BA = R: tan. ⅞C, and (CA -fCB) ’: BA* = R-: tan. f AC·

Now BA s - CA∙ i - CB e = (CA 4- CB) (CA — CB) (Gκr>M. 9 and 18 of 4), therefore

(CA + CB)’: (CA CB) (CA — CB) = R-: tanA∣C, and C A + CB: C A — CB = R»: tan.« ⅜(!.

The first two of these pronositions are alone sufficient for the resolution of all the cases of right-angled triangles; the third, which is not commonly given in our books on trigonometry, is however im∣>ortant, because when the lrypo-tennse and a side are given, by its application the same logarithms serve for finding the remaining side and the tangent of half the opposite angle.

15. It has been found conducive to brevity and perspicuity, to represent the parts of a triangle, each by a single letter: therefore, in any triangle ABC, we shall, in what follow«, employ that notation to denote the sides and angles as follows. (See figures 2, 3, 4.)

The sides, BC =α, AC = b, AB = c; the angles, BAC = A, ABC = B, ACB = C.

It will also be sometimes convenient to express ratios by fractions, the numerators of which are the antecedents, and the denominators tl>c consequents, so that the expressions A C

A: B = C: D, and ⅛r = w∙, arc to be regarded as identical. B 1J

***THEOREM IV. The sides of any plane triangle are to one another as the sines of the opposite angles. ( Figs. 3 and 4.) In the triangle ABC, draw AD perpendicular to BC; then, employing the premised notation, that is, denoting the sides by β, b, c, and opposite angles by A, B, C, b: AD = R: sin. C; and AD: e = sin. B: R; thereforc, ex aquali, inversely, b: c = sin. B: sin. C.

***THEOREM V. The sum of the sides of any plane triangle is to the difference, as the tangent of half the sum of the opposite angles is to the tangent of half their difference.

Continuing the same notation, we have found that b: c = sin. B: sin. C; therefore b 4- c: b — o = sin. B -fsin. C: sin. B — sin. C. Now (Algebkλ, 247, M), sin. B -∣- sin.C: sin.B—sin.C=tan. A (B 4- C): tan. ∣ (B—C); therefore, b 4- c: b — c=, tan. ⅛ (13 4- C): tan. -∣ (B — C). corollary. Since B 4- C = 180°— A, and therefore ⅛(B + C) = 90°-⅜A, therefore b -f- c: b — c= cot. ∣ A: tan. J (B — C).

***THEOREM VI. In any triangle, the cosine of half the difference of any two of its angles is to the cosine of half their sum, as the sum of the sides opposite these angles is to the remaining side. And the sine of half the difference of the angles is to the sine of half their sum, as the difference of the opposite sides to the remaining side.

Again, denoting the sides by a, b, c, and opposite angles by A, B, c,

Because sin. A: sin. C = α: c, and sin. B: sin. C == b: c; therefore sin. A + sin. B: sin. C '= a -f- b : c, also sin. A — sin. B: sin. C = α — b i c.

Now, sin. A + sin. B = 2 sin. 4 (A + B) cos. A (A — B) (Algebra, 240), and sin. A — sin. B = 2 cos. ⅜ (A + B) sin. ∣ (A — B), and sin.C= sin.(A + B) = 2sin. * (Λ-f-B)cos.∣(A-t-B) (Algebra, 245); therefore sin. A + sin. B; sin. C = cos. ⅛ (A — B): cos. ⅜(A + B), and sin. A — sin. B: sin. C ~ sin. ⅜ (A — B): sin. i (A + B); hence cos. A (A — B): c∙os.^⅜ (A 4- B) = a *+ b: c, and sin. Î (A — R): sin. ⅜ (A -jB) = α — b: c; ***Theorem VII. If a perpendicular be drawn from an angle of a triangle on the opposite side, dividing it into two segments, the sum of these segments is to the sum of the sides as the difference of tjιc sides tq the difference of the segments.

In the triangle ACB, AC* = AD 2 4- CD 5 , and AB 2 = AD- i + DB 2 , therefore AC’ — AB= = CD i — BD-. Now AC 2 — AB 2 = (AC + AB)(AC-rAB), and CD'— BD 2 = (CD + BD) (CD — BD) (Geometry, 12, 4); therefore (AC+AB) (AC— AB)-(CD÷BD)(CD-BD), and CD + BD: AC + AB = AC — AB: CD — BD.

***TheoreM VIII. In any plane triangle, the excess of the sum of the squares of two sides which contain an angle above the square of the third side, is to twice the rectangle contained by the sides about the angle, as the cosine of the angle is to radius. (Figs. 3 and 4.)

In the triangle ABC, draw AD perpendicular to BC, we have, by Geometry, 14, 4, and Cor. 2, Theorem I., of this, c- = a* + lf— 2α X CD, and CD - .

therefore c t — a" + b i — 2ab —, 1 α s + b° — e i cos, C and ~⅞⅛ = ~R~ ι therefore a° + br — c°: 2ab — cos. C: R.

We have, in the diagram, made the angle C acute, but the proposition is equally true when C is an obtuse angle; because, when C changes from acute to obtuse, the sign of the cosine of the angle changes from -fto —.

***Theorem IX. In any triangle, the rectangle contained by two sides is to the rectangle containcd by half the perimeter and the excess of half the perimeter above the base, as the square of the radius to the square of the cosine of half the angle contained by the sides.

It has been found that a, b, c, being the sides of a triangle, and A the angle contained by b and c, then, Theorem VI IL, cos. A _ b i 4- e 2 — α'

***Theorem X. In any triangle, the rectangle contained by two sides is to the rectangle contained by the excesses of half its perimeter above these sides, as the square of the radius to the square of the sine of half the angle contained by the sides.

Supposing, as in last proposition, that b and c are the sides about an angle A, and a the side opposite to a, we have, by Theorem IX.

***THEOREM XI. In any triangle, the rectangle contained by half the perimeter, and its excess above the base, is to the rectangle contained by the excesses of half the perimeter above the two sides, as the square of the radius to the square of the tangent of half the angle contained by the sides.

As in the two preceding theorems, putting b and c for the sides about the angle A, and a for the opposite side, and s =∣ (α -∣- b -∣- c), we have found that s (s — a) ∙. be = cos. 2 A: R", and be: (s — b) (s — c) = R': sin.'∣A; therefore, ex tεquαli, s(st-a): (s — b)(s — c) = cos.' ⅛A: sin.’ ∣A.

This seems to be the most convenient formula for finding the angles of a triangle when the sides are given.

16. Having laid down principles, we are next to apply them to trigonometrical calculation. The foundation, as has been already observed, is a table which shows, in parts of the radius, the lengths of the sine, and tangent, and secant, to every minute or smaller division of the quadrant. The most extensive table of this kind is that of G. Joachimus Rhaeticus, published in 1596. It gives the sines, &c. to every ten seconds. The invention of logarithms has in a great measure superseded the use of the natural sines, as they are called, and, except for particular purposes, the logarithms of the natural sines, called logarithmic sines, only are used. Of tables containing these, there are innumerable varieties, according as they are of greater or less extent. The Arithmetica Logarithmica of Briggs, published in 1628, by Adrian Viacq, in two folio volumes, is the most extensive. His tables give the logarithms of 100,000 numbers, and logarithmic sines and tangents to every ten seconds and to ten places of decimals. Hutton’s Tables give the natural sines, and tangents, and secants; also their logarithms to every minute and to seven figures. Callet’s Tables Portatives give the logarithmic sines and tangents to every ten seconds; and Taylor’s Tables, in a large quarto, give the same to every second. For general use, Callet’s are the most convenient. Tables which give the logarithms of numbers and sines, &c. to six, and even to five figures, are also useful. Of the former, we recommend Tables of six-figure Logarithms, superintended by Richard Farley of the Nautical Almanac Office (printed for Longman and Co. 1840); and of the latter, Tables of Logarithms, under the superintendence of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (Taylor and Walton, 1839). Those who perform many calculations find it convenient to have tables of different extent. The size of our work, and the form of its pages, make it quite unsuitable for a useful logarithmic table, which should be as portable as it can be made. Accordingly we have given none.

17. It is customary to treat first of right-angled triangles, and next of such as have all their angles oblique.

RIGHT-ANGLED PLANE TRIANGLES.

These form four distinct cases. Adhering to the notation premised in article 15, we shall denote the hypotenuse by the letter b, the sides about the right angle by a and c, and the opposite angles by A and C. (See fig. 2.)

***Case I. Given the side a, and either of the acute angles A, C, and consequently (Geometry, 24, 1) both; to find the hypotenuse b and remaining side c. Solution. R: tan. C = side a : side c;

R: sec. C = side a : hyp. b : or cos. C: R = side a : hyp. b. Case II. Given the hypotenuse b, and either of the acute angles A, C; to find the sides a, c about the right angle B.

Solution. R: cos. C = hyp. b : side a,

R: sin. C = hyp. b : side c.

Case III. Given the sides a , c about the right angle B; to find the angles A, C, and hypotenuse b. Solution. Side a : side c = R: tan. C, cos. C: R = side a : hyp. b.

The hypotenuse C may be found independently of the angles by the formula b = √(n' -fc') (Geometry, 13, 4). The angle A is found from C, as above.

Case IV. Given the hypotenuse b, and a side u; to find the angles A, C, and side c.

Solution. Hyp. b : side a = R: cos. C; or thus, b 4- a: b — a = R': tan.’ ∣C; then side c = √ ((δ -fα) (b— β)].

The advantage of this solution is, that the same logarithms, viz. of b -f- α and b — a, serve to find the side c and angle C.

This second solution, although not given in our books of trigonometry, is better than the first, because the two things sought are obtained by the same logarithms, and independently of each other.

No notice is here taken of geometrical constructions of the cases by scales. We however recommend that the student construct all the cases geometrically, and refer him to the article Navigation for examples and practical directions.

OBLIQUE-ANGLED TRIANGLES.

19. The three angles of any plane triangle being equal to two right angles (Geometry, 24, 1), when two of them are given, the third is also given.

There are four cases of oblique-angled triangles.

Case I. When a side a, and two angles B, C, and consequently the third angle A, which is the supplement of B + C, are given; to find the sides b, c. ***SolutION. Sin. A: sin. B =α: bl , π ...

Sin. A: sin. C=a: c∫ 11, ∙ * ' ∙

Case II. Two sides b, c, and an angle C opposite to one of them, are given; to find the other two angles A, B, and the remaining side a. (Fig. 7.)

SolutION. Side c: side b — sin. C: sin. B (Th. IV.) When B is found, A = 180° — (B 4- C) is known; and sin. C: sin. A ≡ side c: side a.

Since any two angles, which make together two right angles, have the same sine, and the angle B in this case is to be found by its sine only being known; it will have two distinct values, viz. B, and B'= 180°—B. The angle A may also have two values, A = 180°—(B + C), and A'= 180° — (B' + C). Thus there will be two triangles ABC, AB'C, which alike satisfy the conditions of the data. It must however be considered that the three angles of a triangle cannot exceed two right angles, therefore if C be an obtuse angle, B can only be an acute angle, because a triangle cannot have two obtuse angles. Farther, if the side c opposite to the given angle C be greater than b, in this case B can have but one value; for when c is greater than b, then C is greater than either of the values of B, one of which is 180 — B (Geometry, 13, 1), and C + B will be greater than 180°, which is impossible (24, 1).

***Because 7- = -7—⅛, and sin. B cannot exceed the radius, b sin. B

therefore c τ cannot be less than -∙⅛∙ -; and unless the data b . it satisfy this condition, the solution will be impossible.

Case II. Two sides b, c, and the angle A between them, are given; to find the angles B, C, and the remaining side a. V

***SolutioN. When A is given, B + C its supplement is given; then b 4- c ∙.b—c — tan. ⅜(B + C): tan. <j(B— C). (Theorem V.)

Thus A(B — C) becomes known, and B = ∣(B -∣-C) 4- £(B — C), also C = ∣(B + C) — J(B — C), are known. All the angles of the triangle being known, and two of its sides; the remaining side may be found in two ways by Case I., or better by either of these proportions,

Case IV. The three sides α, b, c are given; to find the three angles.

Then, by Theorem XL, tan. ⅛A — — — ∙ R, tan. ⅛B

9 — b * 9— c [7:21:376] By this rule, the values of the three, angles may be readily found, and also a verification of the calculation, because the sum of the halves of the angles must make ninety degrees.·

Other solutions may be had from Theorems VII. VIII. IX. X. That from Theorem VII. (which resolves the triangle into two right-angled triangles by a perpendicular on one of its sides from the opposite angle) is very generally used by practical men not much versed in theory; but the best solutions are those which follow from Theorems IX. X. XL These elegant formulae were first found about the year 1653, by William Purser of Dublin. The modification of Theorem XL, given here as a practical rule, is the best method we know for resolving this case.

As a verification, a may be found from this other proportion:

Sin. ½ (B — C): sin. ½ (B + C) = b — c : a.

The side a may also be found by Case I. in two ways, because all the angles and two sides are known.

20. In all the preceding operations, the logarithm of the fourth term of each proportion has been found by subtracting the logarithm of the first term from the sum of the logarithms of the second and third. Now, in every case, when one number a is to be subtracted from another number b, we may obtain the result required by adding the difference between a , and n any number, and then subtracting the number n from the result. Thus, instead of subtracting 7 from 12, we may add 3, the difference between 7 and 10, to 12, and then rejecting 10 from 15, the sum, obtain 5 for the difference between 12 and 7. The reason of this may be easily understood, and it is evident from algebraic subtraction; for A — a — b + (n — a ) — n. When a , the number to be subtracted, is less than 10, then n is conveniently assumed = 10, and when a is between 10 and 20, then n may be taken = 20. Thus, if 17 is to be subtracted from 63, the remainder, 46, is found by adding 3 ( = 20 — 17) to 63, and rejecting 20 from the sum.

Hence, in trigonometrical calculation, instead of subtracting the log. of the first of four proportionals from the sum of the logs, of the second and third in order to obtain the log. of the fourth term, we may add into one sum the logs, of the second and third terms, and the difference between the log. of the first and 10, and rejecting, mentally, 10 from the sum, we have what is required.

The difference between a logarithm and 10·00000, &c. is called the arithmetical complement of that logarithm; and it is most readily obtained by subtracting every figure, beginning at the left hand, from 9, and the last significant figure from 10; thus, the arithmetical complement of 2·7365) is 7∙26349, and the arithmetical complement of 9∙78460 is 0·21540. By the introduction of the arithmetical complements of logarithms, fewer figures are required in calculations; for, with a little practice, it will be found as easy to read the arithmetical complements of logarithms from the table as the logarithms themselves. We have now this rule for finding a fourth proportional to three given numbers. Add together the arithmetical complement of the logarithm of the first term, and the logarithms of the second and third terms; the sum is the logarithm of the fourth.

***As an example, take the above proportion:

Various applications of trigonometry have been given in Mensuration and Navigation; to these we refer the reader for more examples in the calculation of triangles.

Part II.— Spherical Τrιgονομετrυ.

1. In our treatise on Geometry we have defined a pyramid (Sect. xi. Def. 6). The most simple solid of this kind is the triangular pyramid, or tetraedron, contained by four plane triangles, or faces, each of which has a side common with the other three. The angles of these form four solid angles. Each of the solid angles presents for our consideration six plane angles; namely, the three angles about the solid angle, and the three angles made by the planes of the faces, which are so related, that any three of them being given, the other three may be found. The investigation of formulae which furnish rules by which this may be accomplished, forms the object of what is to follow.

2. In the calculus of sines, the things considered are plane angles. If two of these be inward angles of a triangle, and the third the outward and opposite angle, our formula for the sines, tangents, &c. of the sum and difference of two angles (Algebra) will express relations among the angles of a plane triangle. We are now to investigate formulae analogous to these, which shall involve the angles of a pyramid. Although the calculus which treats of angles made by straight lines in a plane may be established independently of a circle, yet it is conducive to perspicuity to employ arcs of circles as the measures of angles. This has led to the measuring of the angles of a pyramid by arcs of circles on the surface of a sphere whose centre is the vertex; then the angles made by the planes of its faces will be shown by the angles contained by tangents to the circles at their points of intersection.

3. In treating of spherical trigonometry, we shall begin by explaining some properties of the sphere which depend on principles purely geometrical.

DEFINITIONS.

I. A sphere is a solid figure generated by the revolution of a semicircle about a diameter which remains unmoved.

******II. The diameter about which the semicircle turns, is the axis of the sphere; and the point which is the middle of that diameter is the centre of the sphere.

III. A straight line drawn from the centre to any point in the surface of a sphere, is a radius of the sphere. It is evident that all the radii are equal.
