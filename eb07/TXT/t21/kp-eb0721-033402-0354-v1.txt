TONNEINS, a city of France, in the department of the Lot and the Garonne, and in the arrondissement of Mar-mande. It is on a fertile plain on the right bank of the Garonne, along which its broad well-built streets extend to a great length. The inhabitants amounted in 1836 to 6494. They cultivate much tobacco and hemp, but the city has now very few manufactures.
