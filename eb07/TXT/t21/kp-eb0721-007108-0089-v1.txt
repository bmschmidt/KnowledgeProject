TALLY is a stick cut in two parts, on each of which is marked, with notches or otherwise, what is due between debtor and creditor; and this was the ancient way of keeping all accounts, one part being kept by the creditor, the other by the debtor. Hence the tallier of the exchequer, whom we now call the teller. But there are two kinds of tallies mentioned in our statutes to have been long used in the exchequer. The one is termed tallies of debt, which are in the nature of an acquittance for debts paid to the king, on the payment of which these tallies are delivered to the debtors, who carrying them to the clerk of the pipe-office, have there an acquittance in parchment for their full discharge. The other are tallies of reward or allowance, being made to sheriffs of counties, as a recompense for such matters as they have performed to their charge, or such money as is cast upon them in their accounts of course, but not leviable. In the exchequer there is a tally-court, where attend the two deputy-chamberlains of the exchequer and the tally-cutter; and a tally is generally the kingâ€™s acquittance for money paid or lent, and has written on it words proper to express on what occasion the money is received.
