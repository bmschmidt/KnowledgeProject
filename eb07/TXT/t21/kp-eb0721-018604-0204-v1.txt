TERRASSON, John, born at Lyon in 1669, distinguished himself in the dispute concerning Homer, between La Motte and Madame Dacier, by writing a “Dissertation Critique sur l’Iliade d’Homère.” Paris, 1715, 2 tom. 12mo. Among other works, he likewise wrote a political and moral romance called Sethos. It is a publication of considerable learning and ability. He published a French translation of Diodorus Siculus. Paris, 1737-44, 7 tom. 12mo. Terrasson is commonly described as Abbe, but he only appears to have been in sub-deacon’s orders. In 1721 he became professor of Greek and Latin in the College of France. Having out-lived his memory, he died at Paris on the 15th of September 1750.
