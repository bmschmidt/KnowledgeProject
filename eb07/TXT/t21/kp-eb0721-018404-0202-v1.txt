TENTERDEN, a town in the hundred of the same name, and the lathe of Scray, in the county of Kent, thirty-seven miles from London. It stands on a hill, and the lofty steeple of its church is distinguished from every part of the extensive district by which it is surrounded, and was formerly used as a beacon. At the first introduction of the woollen manufacture, it was an industrious place; but that occupation has long ceased. It is an ancient borough, and is governed by a mayor, four aldermen, and eleven councillors. There is a market held on Friday. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 3259, and in 1831 to 3177.
