THESSALY, a country of Greece, the boundaries of which have been different at different periods. Properly speaking, Thessaly was bounded on the south by the southern parts of Greece, or Graecia Propria; cast, by the Aegean; north, by Macedonia and Mygdonia; and west, by Illyricum and Epirus. It was generally divided into four separate provinces, Thessaliotis, Pelasgiotis, Istiaeotis, and Phthiotis, to which some add Magnesia. It has been likewise called Aemonia, Pelasgicum, Argos, Hellas, Argeia, Dryopis, Pelasgia, Pyrrhaea, &c. The name of Thessaly is derived from Thessalus, one of its monarchs. Thessaly is famous for a deluge which happened there in the age of Deucalion. Its mountains and cities are also celebrated, such as Olympus, Pelion, Ossa, Larissa, &c. The Argonauts were partly natives of Thessaly. The inhabitants of the country passed for a treacherous nation, so that false money was called Thessalian coin, and a perfidious action a Thessalian deceit. Thessaly was originally governed by kings, till it became subject to the Macedonian monarchs. It is bounded by Macedonia on the north, by the Archipelago on the cast, by Achaia or Livadia on the south, and by Epirus on the west.
