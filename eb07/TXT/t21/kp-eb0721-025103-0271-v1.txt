THORN, a city, formerly one of the most distinguished, in the kingdom of Poland, but now the capital of a circle of the same name in the government of Dantzig and the province of West Prussia. It stands on the river Vistula, which is there nearly two miles across. There is a bridge of boats from the city to an island in the centre of the stream, and another from that island to the right bank. Thorn is a frontier town towards the Russian territory, is strongly fortified on every side, and a large garrison is always quartered in it. The buildings are of an antique fashion, very large and firm. There is a good market-place, but the streets are crooked and narrow. It contains three Catholic, one Lutheran, and one Reformed church; a monastery, a nunnery, a Catholic gymnasium with a good library, 800 houses, and 10,400 inhabitants, who carry on trade on the river in com, and make woollens, linens, leather, paper, soap, and gloves. It was the birth-place of the celebrated astronomer Copernicus, born in 1515. Long. 23. 44. 57. E. Lat. 53. 1. 30. N.
