THEOREM I. Every section of a sphere made by a plane is a circle.

Let ADBE be a sphere, and DHE the curve line which is the common section of its surface and any plane. From O, the centre of the sphere, draw OF perpendicular to the plane DHE, and draw FH to any point in the curve DHE and join OH. In the triangle OFH, the angle OFH is a right angle; therefore FH = ^∕(OH- — OF’). Now the lines OH and OF are invariable for all points in the curve DIIE, therefore FH is invariable, and the curve DHE is the circumference of a circle whose radius is FH.

Def. IV. The common section of a sphere and any plane that passes through its centre, is a great circle of the sphere. Let ADBE be a sphere whose centre is O; the circle DFE, in which any plane passing through O meets the sphere, is a great circle.

Cor. 1. All great circles of the sphere are equal; and any two great circles mutually bisect each other.

Cor. 2. A great circle may pass through any two assigned points on a sphere, which are not the extremities of a diameter. For if straight lines be drawn from the centre to the points, a plane may pass along these lines, and only one plane, whose common section with the sphere will be a great circle.

Def. V. The pole of a great circle is a point on the surface of the sphere, from which all straight lines drawn to the circumference of the circle are equal.

Let DEE be a great circle, and O its centre; take D and F any points in its circumference, join OD, OF, and draw OA perpendicular to the plane of the circle, meeting the surface of the sphere in A, and join AD, AF; because AO is perpendicular to the plane DEE, the angles AOD, AOF are right angles; therefore AD = AF, hence A is the pole of the circle DFE.

Cor. Since a perpendicular to the plane of the circle DFE through its centre must meet the sphere in two points; a great circle has two poles, A, B, which are the extremities of a diameter of the sphere perpendicular to the plane of the circle, and it can have no more.

Theorem II. The arcs of a great circle between the poles and the circumference of another great circle are quadi ants.

Let A and B be the poles of a great circle DFE, whose centre is O; let ADB be any other great circle that passes through A and B and meets the circle DFE in E: Because the poles of the circle DEF are at the extremities of AB, the diameter of the sphere that is perpendicular to its plane, the angles ΛOD, BOD are right angles, therefore AD, BD, the arcs of the circle ADB, arc quadrants.

Def. VI. A spherical angle is the angle on the surface [7:21:378] of the sphere made by two great circles at their intersection: it is identical with the angle made by two straight lines in the planes of the circles which touch them at their intersection; and it is also the same as the angle made by the planes of the circles.

Let AEB, AFB, be two great circles that intersect each other at A and B (Fig. 2). From O the centre of the sphere, and A the intersection of the circles, draw OE and AP in the plane of the circle AEB, and OF, AQ in the plane of the circle AFB perpendicular to AB, the common section of the circles; the straight lines AP, AQ, will touch the circles at A, and form an angle PAQ, which is the spherical angle at A; and since PAQ is equal to EOF (Geometry, Part ii. 10, 1), the inclination of the planes of the circles, this last also expresses the spherical angle at A.

Cor. 1. the adjacent spherical angles which one great circle makes with another, are together equal to two right angles; and the vertical or opposite angles made by two great circles which cut one another are equal.

C or . 2. The spherical angle made by two great circles is measured by an arc of a great circle whose pole is at their intersection.

Def. VII. A spherical triangle is a figure on the surface of the sphere comprehended by three arcs of great circles, each of which is less than a semicircle.

If planes be supposed to pass along the arcs AB, BC, AC, which are the sides of the triangle; these will pass through O, the centre of the sphere, and form at that point a solid angle O (Geometry , Def. vi. of Part ii).

Τηεοrεμ III. Any two sides of a spherical triangle are together greater than the third; and the sum of the arcs which are its sides is less than the circumference of a great circle.

The arcs AB, AC, BC, arc the measures of the plane angles AOB, AOC, BOC, about the solid angle O. Now, any two of these plane angles are greater than the third (Geometry, Part ii. 16, 1), therefore any two sides of the spherical triangle ABC is greater than the third: and because the sum of the plane angles about the solid angle is less than four right angles (17); therefore the sum of the sides of the spherical triangle, which are their measures, must be less than the sum of four quadrants, that is, less than the circumference of a great circle.

Theorem IV. If about the angular points of a spherical triangle, as poles, there be described three great circles on the sphere; these by their intersections will form a triangle which is said to be supplemental to the former; and the two triangles are such, that the sides of the one are the supplements of the arcs which measure the angles of the other.

Let ABC be a spherical triangle; let EF be an arc of a great circle whose pole is A, and FD an arc of a great circle whose pole is B, and DE an arc of a great circle whose pole is C; these three arcs forming the triangle DEF. Let DB be an arc of a great circle passing through the points D, B, and DC an arc of a great circle passing through the points D, C. Because B is the pole of the arc DF, the arc BD is a quadrant (Th . II.), and because C is the pole of the arc DE, the arc CD is a quadrant. Since then the arcs BD, CD, are both quadrants, D is the pole of a great circle that passes through the points B, C; but only one great circle can pass through two points on the sphere not directly opposite, therefore D must be the pole of the arc BC. In the same way, it will appear that E is the pole of the arc AC, and F the pole of the arc AB. Produce the arcs AB, AC, if necessary, till they meet the arc EF in G and H; the point A being the pole of the arc GH, the angle A will be measured by GH. Now EH and FG being both quadrants, EH + FG = 180°; but EH + FG = EF + GH, therefore EF + GH = 180°, that is, EF, a side of the triangle DEF, is the supplement of GH, the measure of the angle A. In the very same way, it will appear that DF is the supplement of the angle B, and DE the supplement of the angle C; and because the triangle ABC may be formed from the triangle DEF exactly in the same way that DEF is constructed from ABC, namely, by describing great circles about the angles D, E, F, as poles, the triangles and their relations to each other may be interchanged. Hence it appears that BC, AC, AB, the sides of the triangle ABC, are the supplements of D, E, F, the angles of the triangle DEF.

Theorem V. The three angles of any spherical triangle arc greater than two right angles, but less than six.

In the triangle ABC (fig. 4), the measures of the angles A, B, C, together with DE, EF, DF, the sides of the supplemental triangle DEF, make six right angles. (Τη. IV.) Now the sum of the sides of the triangle DEF is less than four right angles (Tn. III.), therefore the sum of the three angles A, B, C, is greater than two right angles; and because the three inward angles of any triangle, together with the adjacent exterior angles, are equal to six right angles, therefore the inward angles alone are less than six right angles.

4. We might proceed in this way, establishing the whole doctrine of spherical trigonometry by a series of synthetical demonstrations; such was the practice of the earlier writers on this subject. This however has now given way to a more convenient and elegant method of proceeding, which dispenses with complicated diagrams representing on a plane surface circles on a sphere. It deduces by the angular calculus the whole theory of spherical trigonometry (including also the theorems already here demonstrated) from a single proposition, in a manner probably first followed out by Bertrand of Geneva in his Développement nouveau de lu Partie Elémentaire des Mathématiques (Geneva, 1778). Lagrange seems to have overlooked this work, for in his elegant memoir, entitled Solutiοns de quelques Problèmes relatifs aux Triangles Sphériques. avec une Analyse complète de ces Triangles, given in vol. ii. of Journal de l’Ecole Polytechnique, he has attributed the theorem to De Gua, who also gave it in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1783.

5. Our article on the Arithmetic of Sines (Algebra, sect 25) is an example of what may be done by the power of anaiysis alone in deducing an extensive theory from a few simple geometrical principles. Such is the way in which Lagrange and later writers treat of spherical trigonometry. We shall also follow the method of Delambre, who, in his Astronomie Théorique et Pratique, chap. x., instead of numerous rules deduced from geometrical constructions, for determining when angles or arcs are less or greater than quadrants, considers their sines and cosines as positive or negative quantities, according to the principles of analytic geometry, as explained at article 225 in Algebra. From what has been there explained, it appears that,

(1.) A sine is positive when the arc is less than 180°, but negative when the arc i« between 180° and 360°.
[7:21:379]

(2.) If an arc be taken negatively, its sine is negative in the first half of the circle, but positive in the second.

(3.) The cosine of an arc = 0 is unity: it is 0 when the arc = 90°; between arc = 0 and arc = 90°, the cosine is positive, and between arc = 90° and arc = 270° the cosine is negative, and between 270° and 360° it is positive. A positive and a negative arc have the same cosine, so that to a given cosine the arc may be taken either as positive or as negative.

(4.) Since tan. A≡ the tangent is positive in tl>e first quadrant of the circle, because the sine and cosine are both positive; it is negative in the second, because the sine is positive and the cosine negative; it is positive in the third quadrant, because the sine and cosine are both negative; lastly, it is negative in the fourth quadrant, because the sine is negative and the cosine positive. The tangent is = 0 when the arc is 0 or 180°, and infinite when the arc is 90° or 270°.

(5.) When the arc is known, we can always give the tangent the proper sign. If the arc X is not known, and we have simply tan. x = a, it cannot be known whether the are be positive or negative; if a be a positive number, the tangent belongs alike to two arcs, x and 180° + x. If a be negative, tan. a belongs to an arc between 90° and 180°, or between 270° and 360°. The problem therefore admits of two solutions.

***But if tan. x = -, and that the two terms of the fraction n are positive, then x ∙κ 90°. If m be positive and n negative, x ≥.. 90 β ; when rn and n are both negative, x ≥*, 180°; lastly, if m be negative and n positive, x 270°.

(6.) The rule of the signs for cotangents is the same as for the tangents, since tan. x = ——, or cot. x = —-—. cot. x tan.«

(7.) The rule for the signs of secants is the same as that for cosines, seeing that sec. x=—-—.

COS. X

(8.) The rule for cosecants is the same as for sines, since 1

cosec. X = - sin. x

(9.) When an arc is known, the sign of its sine is known; but when x, an unknown arc, is to be found from sin. x — a, the sine belongs alike to x and 180° — x, if a be positive; or to 180° + x, and 360° — x, if a be negative.

(10.) When an arc a is known, the sign of its cosine is known; but if we have cos. x = b, we do not know whether x be in the first or fourth quadrant if x is positive, or whether it be in the second or third when x is negative. The problem therefore has also, in this case, two solutions. The nature of the problem may however determine that which the algebraic rule leaves ambiguous. Delambre, in his Astronomy, says, “These rules are general, and easily remembered, and never mislead a calculator; while, on the contrary’, the rules with which most writers have complicated trigonometry, are so perplexing that there is hardly an author that has not given false ones.” The rule of the signs was long neglected by astronomers, on the known principle that improvements come slowly into general use.

6. *****Let ABC be a spherical triangle, and let O be the centre of the sphere; draw the radii OA, OB, OC. The solid angle at O is contained by the three plane angles AOB, BOC, AOC, and the measures are the arcs AB, BC, AC, which are the sides of the triangle ABC.

At the point A in the plane AOB, draw AD touching the arc AB, and meeting the plane BOC in D; and in the plane AOC draw AE touching the arc AC, and meeting the plane BOC in E. The angle DAE contained by the tangents AD, AE, is the same as the spherical angle BAC (Def. vi.). Join the points D, E by a straight line, which will be at once the base of the plane triangles DAE, DOE, the vertices of which are joined by the line AO, a radius of the sphere. We shall throughout make this line the unit, and express it by 1. Let us now denote the sides and angles of the spherical triangle ABC as follows.

The sides BC = a, AC — b, AB = c; The angles BAC = A, ABC = B, ACB = C. We have now

AE = tan. b — -- p OE = scc. b = ., cos. b cos. o

. τ∙x s ∙ n ∙ c ΛΓ, 1

AD = tan. c — , OD = sec. c = .

cos. c cos. c

By plane trigonometry (Tn. VIII.), in the plane triangle ADE, DE 2 f= AE 2 + AD 2 — 2 AE∙AD cos. A, ( = tan. 2 b 4- tan. 2 c — 2 tan. b tan. c cos. A; and in the triangle ODE, we have also de , f = OE- + OD 1 — 2 OE∙OD cos. α,

I = sec. 8 b -f-sec. 2 c — 2 sec. b sec. c cos. a. Hence, subtracting the sides of the first of these equations from the sides of the second, and considering that sec. 2 b— tan. 2 b = 1, sec. 8 c — tan. 2 c — 1, we have 0=l-∣-l — 2 sec. b sec. c cos. a + 2 tan. b tan. c cos. A; and hence, again dividing the terms by 2, &c.

sec. b sec. c cos. a = I -f-tan. b tan. c cos. A;

, . cos. a , 1 sin. b sin. c , that is,; =1-1 r cos. A; cos. b cos. c cos. o cos. c and multiplying both sides by cos. b cos. c, cos. a = cos. b cos. c -∣- sin. b sin. c cos. A.

This is the formula given by Bertrand, and it comprehends in itself the whole principles of spherical trigonometry.

7. Since the same property must belong alike to the three sides, we may interchange the letters which represent them and the angles, and thus have

I.

Cos. a = cos. b cos. c + sin. b sin. c cos. A...(l) Cos. b = cos. a cos. c 4- sin. a sin. c cos. B...(2) Cos. c = cos. a cos. b + sin. a sin. b cos. C...(3)

8. To deduce other formulae from these, w∙e add and subtract the first and second, and thus get

, f — (cos. b — cos. a) cos. c cos. b cos. a — I (s j n , a cos . β — sin. b cos. A) sin. c∙, and from these again, by transposing the first term on the right-hand side,

(cos. b + cos. α) (1 - cos. c) = ∣ gin b c θ g a j sin. e, , i ∖ . ∖ I sin. « cos. B I . _.

(cos. b — cos. a) ( 1 + cos.c) = ∣ _ gin b cog a j sin. c, and taking the products of the corresponding sides, and considering that 1 —cos? c = sin. 1 c, we have, after dividing by sin? c, cos? b — cos. 2 a = sin. 2 a cos.’ B — sin.- b cos? A.

Now, since cos. 2 b -fsin. 2 b = cos. 2 a -fsin. 1 a, we have cos. 1 b — cos. 1 a = sin. s α — sin? b; therefore, sin. s a — sin? b =sin. 2 a cos. 1 B — sin.*' b cos. 1 A; [7:21:380] and sin* a (1 —cos. t B) ≡ sin. t Z> (1 —cos.' A); that is, sin. s a sin.' B = sin.* b sin. 2 A, and sin. a sin. B = sin. b sin. A.

From this last, we form these three formulae,

Sin. c_sin. C .

Sin. a sin. A '

Sin. b sin. B

Sin. c - sin. C '

9. By No. 3 of formulae (I.)

cos. c — cos. a cos. b -p sin. α sin. b cos. C, therefore cos. b cos. c = cos. a cos? b -f-

sin. α cos. b sin. b cos. C.

But by No. 1 of formulae I.

cos. b cos c = cos. β—sin. b sin. c cos. A; therefore cos. a— sin. b sin. c cos. A = cos. a cos.’ b -f-

sin. a cos. b sin. b cos. C; and cos. a (1 — cos? ⅛) = sin. b (sin. c cos. A + sin. a cos. b cos. C).

In this expression put sin. 8 b for I—cos. 2 b, and divide both sides by sin. b ; the result is cos. a sin. b z= sin. c cos. A 4- sin. a cos. b cos. C....(wι)

But by formula 2 of II. sin. c ≡ s .- ' r sin. C; therefore sin. A

Divide now by sin. α, and put cot. α for and cot. A for sin. α

-T—r, and there is obtained sin. A

cot. a sin. b ∑= cot. A sin. C ψ cos. b cos. C. By changing b into e and C into B, we have also cot. a sin. c = cot. A sin. B -f-cos. c cos. B.

By treating these two formulae like those in articles 7 and 8, we obtain a class of six formulae, viz.

III.

Cot. a sin. b = cot. A sin. C -f-cos. b cos. C (1)

Cot. a sin. c= cot. A sin. B -j-cos. c cos. B (2)

Cot. b sin. a = cot. B sin. C + cos. a cos. C (3)

Cot. b sin. c — cot. B sin. A -∣- cos. c cos. A (4)

Cot. c sin. a — cot. C sin. B -f-cos. a cos. B (5)

Cot. c sin. b — cot. C sin. A -f-cos. b cos. A (6)

In these formulae, the letters which represent the parts of the triangle are not so symmetrically arranged, as in the two former groups; and on that account they are less easily remembered. This inconvenience will be obviated by attention to the following remarks.

(1.) Both members of each formula begin with the product of a cotangent and a sine.

(2.) The first member is formed from any two of the three sides, and the first term of the second member contains an angle opposite to one of these, and the angle opposite to the side which is not in the first member.

(3.) The last term of the second member is formed by the two cosines of the same arcs of which the sines are already in the equation.

10. Resuming equation (m ) in the preceding article, viz. cos. α sin. b ~ sin. a cos. b cos. C + sin. c cos. A, change α into b and b into α, also A into B, and we have sin. a cos. b = sin. b cos. α cos. C -fsin c cos. H; and multiplingboth sides by cos. C, sin.α cos. b cos. C = sin. b cos. a cos. 1 C -∣- sin. c cos. B cos-C. This value of sin. a cos. b cos. C being substituted in the former equation, it becomes cos. α sin. b = sin. b cos. a cos. , C -fsin. c (cob. B cos. C + cos. A), and by transposing the first term of the second side, cos. α sin. b ( I —cos? C) = sin. c (cos. B cos. C -f-cos. A ). that is, cos. a sin. Λ sin. 2 C = sin. c (cos. B cos. C -(- cos. A).

Now by (3) of formulae IL, sin. b sin. C = sin. c sin. B, therefore this last expression being substituted in the first side of the equation instead of its equal, and both sides being divided by sin. c, we have cos. a sin. B sin. C = cos. B cos. C -f-cos. A.

And by treating the expression just found, as we did those in articles 7, 8, 9, we have these formulae:

IV.

Cos. A = —cos. B cos. C -Jsin. B sin. C cos. a (1)

Cos. B = — cos. A cos. C + sin. A sin. C cos. b...... (2)

Cos. C = — cos. A cos. B -fsin. A sin. B cos. c (3)

11. The sides of a spherical triangle being still denoted by a, b, c, and its angles by A, B, C, let A', B', C', and a', lit, d, be arcs or angles, such that a + A' = 180°, b + B'= 180°, c⅛C'= 180°; A + α' = 180°, B + b' = 180°, C + d = 180°.

Then we have cos. a = — cos. A', cos. b — — cos. B', cos. c = — cos. C', sin. α — sin. A', sin. b = sin. B', sin. c = sin. C'; cos. A — — cos. α', cos. B = — cos. ∕∕, cos. C = — cos. d, sin. A = sin. a', sin. B = sin. fr, sin. C — sin. c.'

Let these values of the sines and cosines of a, b, c and A, B, C be substituted in formulae I. and IV.; they then become cos. A' = — cos. B' cos. C' + sin. B' sin. C' cos. α', cos. B' = — cos. A ’ cos. C' -Jsin. A' sin. C' cos. b', cos. C' = —cos. A' cos. B' 4- sin. A' sin. B' cos. d; cos. a' — cos. U cos. d -∣- sin. b' sin. d cos. A', cos. b’ — cos. α ’ cos. d -Jsin. a' sin. d cos. B', cos. d — cos. a' cos. b' -fsin. a' sin. b' cos. C'.

Hence, from I. and IV., if the arcs a ', b’, d be taken as the sides of a spherical triangle, then the arcs A', B', C' must necessarily be the measures of its angles; thus we have proved analytically our fourth theorem, which has been demonstrated in article 3, from considerations purely geometrical. This theorem, which has been known for two centuries past, may be expressed thus: Any spherical triangle may be changed into another of which the sides and angles are respectively the supplements of the angles and sides of the first. This is the supplement or polar triangle.

12. The four sets of formulae which have been investigated in articles (6), (7), (8), (9) (10), are sufficient for resolving all cases of spherical triangles. When one of the angles is a right angle, they become more simple. We shall now adapt them to that case.

Right-Angled Spherical Triangles.

Let us suppose that A — 90°, then cos. A and cot. A are each = 0, and sin. A = 1.

By considering that the cotangent of an arc is the reciprocal of the tangent, and that the tangent is e<pιal to the sine divided by the cosine, we now obtain these ten formulae for right-angled triangles, in which A is the right angle.

13. These ten formulae, which may however be expressed in words by six, are of continual use in astronomy. It is therefore desirable that they should be comprehended in the fewest number possible of practical rules, simple and easily remembered. Such were found by Napier, the inventor of logarithms, and are known by the name of Napiers Rules of the circular Parts. They are not new propositions, but are merely enunciations, which, by a particular arrangement and classification of the parts of a triangle, include all the six proportions. They are perhaps the happiest example of artificial memory that is known.

In a right-angled spherical triangle ABC, setting aside the right angle A, there remain the sides AC = b and AB = c about the right angle; the hypotenuse BC = a, and the two oblique angles B, C. The first two of these, viz. the sides b, c, and the complements of the remaining three, viz. 90° — a, 90° — B, 90° — C, are called the five circular parts. They are called circular, because, when taken in their order, they go round the triangle.

14. When one of the five circular parts is taken as the middle part, the two next to it, one on each side, are called the adjacent parts; and the other two, each of which is separated from the middle by an adjacent part, are called the opposite parts.

Thus, if 90° — a be the middle part. 90° — C and 90° — B are the adjacent parts, and b and c the opposite parts; if 90° — B be the middle part, 90° — a and c are the adjacent parts, and 90° — C and b are the opposite parts; and if c be the middle part, 90° — B and b are the adjacent parts, and 90°— a and 90° —C the opposite parts; and so on.

This arrangement being made, the rule of the circular parts is contained in the following proposition:

The rectangle under radius and the sine of the middle part is equal to the rectangle under the tangents of the adjacent parts; also to the rectangle under the cosines of the opposite parts.

It may assist the memory if we represent the middle part by the letter M, the adjacent parts by the letters A, a , and the opposite parts by the letters O, o ; the rule will stand thus:

****R∙sin. M = tan. A ∙ tan. a; R ∙ sin. M — cos. O ∙ cos. 0.

15. To verify the rule, let 90° — a, the complement of the hypotenuse, be the middle part; then 90° — C, and 90° — B will be the adjacent, and b, c the opposite parts; and by the rule,

R ∙ sin. (90° — a) f = tan ∙ ( 90 ° — b ) tan ∙ (9υ ° — C)

v 7 I = cos. ο cos. e; ∏ . λλ , λ f = cot. B cot. C. This 19 form. (8) ( = cos. 0 cos. c this is form. (1)

Let 90° — B, the complement of one of the oblique angles, be the middle part, then 90° — α and care the adjacent parts, and 90° — C and b the opposite. The rule gives R ∙ cos B i = c0t ∙ α tan ∙ c Fonn ’ < 4 ’ 5 >

I = sin. C cos. b Form. (9, 10)

Let b, one of the sides about the right angle, be the middle part, then 90*— C and ewill be the adjacent parts, and 90° — a and 90° — B the opposite parts. In this case, by the rule, n . , f = cot. C tan. c.......... Form, f6, 7)

R ∙ sin. bl _ . . n t , )

I = sin. a sin. 15 r orm. (2, 3)

These are all the cases of right-angled triangles.

In applying the rule of the circular parts to resolve any case of right-angled triangles, consider which of the three quantities named (the two things given and the one required) must be made the middle term, in order that the other two may be equidistant from it, that is, may be both adjacent or both opposite; then the one or the other of the theorems which constitute the rule will give the value of the thing required.

Suppose, for example, that c a side about the right angle, and a the hypotenuse, are given to find the angle C. It appears that if c be made the middle part, then 9(90° — a and 90° — C are the opposite parts; and therefore that R ∙ sin. c = sin. a sin. C, and sin. a : sin. c = R: sin. C.

16. Delambre has avowed that he found it easier to remember the six formulae for right-angled triangles than to apply Napier’s rules. In astronomy, the sun’s longitude ( ) is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, of which the right ascension (A R) and declination (D) are the sides about the right angle, the obliquity of the ecliptic (ω ) is one of the oblique angles. Let the other oblique angle be denoted by A, then the six formulae for right-angled spherical triangles adapted to astronomical calculation will stand thus:

***Sin. D = sin. ω sin. Q, tan. .4R = cos. ω tan. 0, tan. D = tan. u sin. All, cos. o = cos. ΛR cos. D, cos. Q — cot. a, cot. A, cos. A = sin. ω cos. ΛR.

The practical astronomer, who has continual occasion to use the first four of these formulae, will find no difficulty in retaining them in his memory. But Napier’s rules will probably be most easily remembered by students of that science.

17. The general formulae, I., II., III., IV., serve for all spherical triangles; but they admit of transformations, which make them more convenient for logarithmic calculation.

Resuming the formula, (I.) we put the first under these two forms.
[7:21:382]

Cos.o= (cos.⅛cos. e —sin.6sιn.c)4-sin.6sin.c(l -J-cos.A), Cos. a= (cos. b cos. c -)- sin.Z>sin.c)—sin.∕>sin.c(l —cos. A).

Now, by the calculus of sines (Algebra, articles 239 and 248),

Cos. b cos. c — sin. b sin. c = cos. (b -fc),

Cos. b cos. c 4- sin. b sin. c = cos. (b — c),

1 + cos. A — 2 cos. 2 J A, 1 — cos. A = 2 sin. 8 ,∣A.

Hence, by substituting, we get

Cos. a — cos. (b -∣- c) 4- 2sin. b sin. c cos. 2 4 A,

Cos. a — cos. (Z> — c) — 2 sin. b sin. c sin. 2 J A; and transposing, and observing that by the calculus of sines (Algebra, art. 240),

Cos.α — cos. (b + c)= 2 sin.] (a -⅜- A 4. e)sin.∣ (6 -f-c—o), Cos. (A —c) — cos,α= 2 sin.) (α-∣-c— b) sin. j (a -∣-⅛ — c), we have

To abridge, let us put À (a -f- b -fc) ≡ s; then J (b 4- c — a) = s — a, ι (a -j- c — b) — s — b, J (α + b—c) - s — c. i. , , . sin. s sin. (s—a)

There are expressions exactly like these for the squares of the cosines and sines of the halves of the angles B, C; and from the whole we obtain

tan. 1A = -——V tan. ⅛B = -.—-. yτ> I

1 sιn.(sα) 2 sm.(f- b) 1

tan. 1C = -—7 ..

sin. (s— c) J

The formulae in this and the preceding article arc exactly like those found for the angles of plane triangles. Those for the tangents of half the angles (which we believe to be given in this form for the first time) seem to be most convenient for use in all cases. In using the others, if half the angle sought be nearly a quadrant, its cosine ought to be sought rathu uι*u ι w uac; ana tne reverse, if the angle be small.

19. We may treat our fourth group of formulae, of which the first is

Cos. A = — cos. B cos. C + sin. B sin. C cos. σ, in all respects as we have the first, putting it under these forms:

Cos. A = — (cos. B cos. C — sin. B sin. C)

— sin. B sin. C (1 — cos. a),

Cos. A = — (cos. B cos. C -∣- sin. B sin. C)

+ sin. B sin. C ( 1 4- cos. a); from which we have, by the calculus of sines (Algebhλ, art. 239), &c.

Cos. A -∣- cos. (B -(- C) = — sin. B sin. C (1 — cos. a),

Cos. A + cos. (B — C) = sin. B sin. C (1 -f-cos. a). Now

Cos.A 4- cos. (B+C)= 2 cos.,] ( A+B-f-C) cos,⅛(B 4- C—A ), C os. A -∣- cos. ( B—C ) = 2 cos.^( A -fC—B) cos.( A 4- B—C), 1 — cos. a — 2 sin. s Jσ, 1 4- cos. a = 2 cos. 2 ∣a.

Therefore, putting

S=J(A + B + C), so that S— A = ⅜(B-(-C — A),

S —B= (A + C —B),

S — C= J(A + B —C), we have

Sin. B sin. C sin.’ ⅛a = — cos. S cos. (S — A),

Sin. B sin. C cos. 2 ⅛a = cos. (S — B) cos. (S — C).

There are like expressions which involve the squares of the sines and cosines of lb and lc, from all which we deduce

20. Dividing now the cosines of the halves of the sides by their sines, thereby getting expressions for the tangents, and proceeding as in article 18, putting’

The sum of the three angles of a spherical triangle always exceeds two right angles; therefore S, half their sum, exceeds a quadrant; and hence cos. S will be a negative quantity, and — cos. S will be positive, and its square root a real quantity.

In astronomical calculations, it very seldom happens that the angles are wanted, from the three sides being given.

21. Recurring to the formulae (a), (∕3) of article 17, we deduce from them the following equations.

Sin. ⅛Bcos. |C _ sin, (s — c) _ sin. ¾ (a + b — c)

By adding and subtracting the sides of these equations, and observing that

(as has been proved in Algebra, articles 240 and 247), we obtain the following results:

These formulae were first given by Gauss, in his work Theoria Motus corporum Caelestium.

22. Let us now divide the sides of formula (1) by those of formula (3), also the sides of (2) by the sides of (4), and the sides of (4) by the sides of (3), and, lastly, the sides of (2) by the sides of (1); and put tan. in the results instead of —also cot. instead of °∙~'; we then have cos. stn∙

tan. ⅜α - sin. ⅜ (B -∣- C) ' ‘

These formulae, expressed in words as proportions, are commonly called Napiers analogies. He however only gave the last in the concise form which it here presents. The third, as he left it, had two common divisors in the terms of a ratio, which he overlooked. His commentator Briggs removed the defect, and, in addition, deduced the first and second formulae from the third and fourth by the theorem here demonstrated in art. 11. Thus he is entitled to share with Napier in the honour of having discovered these very elegant properties of spherical triangles.

From the first and second of these formulae, there is found, by division, this other formula:

(<)

Tan. 4(B - fC) _ tan. ∣(⅛ -∣- c) Tan.∣(B — C) - tan. ⅜(Z> — c)'

This formula is also due to Napier.

23. There are some properties of spherical triangles which may be more concisely proved by the formulae than by geometrical reasoning. Such are those which follow.

I. In a spherical triangle, the greater angle is opposite to the greater side, and conversely.

Let α, b, c be the sides of a spherical triangle, and B, C the angles opposite to the sides b, c. It appears from formula (2) of δ , article 21, that

Sin. ⅜(B — C)_ cos.⅜A.

Sin. ⅜(Z∕— c) - cos. ⅛α

The second member of this equation is always a positive quantity, therefore the first must also be positive. This can only be true on the hypothesis that when b is greater than c , then B is also greater than C. The truth of the converse follows from the same principle.

II. the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle are equal, and conversely.

For we have

Cos. ½ a sin. ½ (B — C) = cos. ½ A sin. ½(b — c ). When b = c, the second side of the equation becomes = 0, therefore the first side must also be = 0. This requires that B = C. The converse follows from the same formula.

III. Any two sides of a spherical triangle are together greater than the third.

It appears from article 17, that

****. sin. b sin. c cos. 2 i A

2y ~ j sm.⅜(α -I- b -fc)

The second side of this equation is always a positive quantity, therefore the first must also be positive. This requires that b + c be in every case greater than a. This proposition has been otherwise proved geometrically, Theorem III.

IV. We have found (article 21) that

Cos. ½ (b + c ) sin. ½A = cos. ½ (B + C) cos. ½ a .

Now sin. ½A and cos. ½ a are always positive, because each arc is less than a quadrant. Therefore cos. ½(b + c ) and cos. ½ (B + C) have always the same sign; and hence ½ (b + c) and ½ (B + C) are of the same affection, and B + C, b + c, either both less than a semicircle, or both equal to it, or both greater.

V. The hypotenuse a of a right-angled spherical triangle is less or greater than 90°, according as the sides b, c, about the right angle A, are of the same affection, or of different affection; that is, in the former case, both less or both greater than 90°; and in the latter, one less and the other greater than 90°.

This follows immediately from the formula cos. a ≡ cos. b cos. c (art. 12); for if b and c be both less than 90° or both greater, they have like signs, and their product has the sign +, which indicates that a is less than 90°. If one of the two b, c be less and the other greater than 90°, they will have different signs, and the sign of their product will be —, and a must be greater than 90°.

VI. The same rule applies to each of the sides b, c ; for b will be less than 90° if a and e be of the same affection, but greater than 90° if a and c are of different affection.

VII. The formula cos. a = cot B cot. C shows that the hypotenuse a will be less than 90° when B and C are of the same affection, but greater than 90° if they be of different affection.

VIII. Also, that either of the angles B, C, will be less than 90° if a and the other angle be of the same affection, but greater than 90° if they be of different affection.

IX. The formula cos. B = cos. b sin. c shows that the angle B and the opposite side b are always of the same affection.

X. The formula tan. c = tan. a cot B shows that the hypotenuse a and either side c are of the same affection if the angle they contain be acute, but of different affection if the angle be obtuse.

XI. Lastly, the formula tan. b = sin. c tan. B proves that the side and the opposite angle are always of the same affection.

XII. In any spherical triangle ABC, draw AD an arc of a great circle perpendicular to the base BC, thus forming two right-angled triangles ADC, ADB, which have [7:21:384] a common side AD. We have (art. 13) tan. AD = tan. C sin. CD = tan. B sin. BD; hence the angles ACD, ABD, are either both acute or both obtuse. If therefore ACB and ABC be of the same affection, the perpendicular falls within the triangle ABC; but if the angles ACB' and AB'C are of contrary affection, the perpendicular falls without the triangle AB’C.

Solution of Right-Angled Triangles.

A spherical triangle may have one right angle, or it may have two, or three. If it have two right angles, the sides opposite to these will be quadrants, and the third the measure of the remaining angle. If it have three right angles, it will be equilateral, and its sides quadrants. We shall set aside these cases, and consider only that in which one of the angles is a right angle, and the other two oblique, which may be either acute or obtuse. The side opposite to the right angle is named the hypotenuse.

The solutions are to be derived from the formulae in art. 12; and as in the investigations, to abridge, the radius was supposed to be the unit, we shall in the rules express it as in the formulae of plane trigonometry by the letter R.

Case I. Given the hypotenuse a and b , one of the sides about the right angle, to find the other side c, and the oblique angles B, C. These are to be found from formulae (1), (2, 3), (4, 5).

Solution.

***_ cos. α . sin. b tan. b .

Cos. c = r R, sin. B = R, cos. C ≡ IL

cos. b sin. α tan. n

If a and b be of the same affection, then c must be less than a quadrant, and also the measure of the angle C. But if a and b be of different affection, then the side c and the angle c must be both greater than quadrants. The angle B and the side b will be of the same affection.

Case II. Given the sides b and c about the right angle, to find the hypotenuse a , and the angles B, C. Here the formulae to be used are (1), (6, 7).

Solution.

In all the cases it must be considered whether the arcs found be less or greater than quadrants, by the algebraic signs + or -, which belong to the given arcs and angles as expressed in article 5.

Case III. Given the hypotenuse a, and an oblique angle B, to find the sides b, r, and the other oblique angle C. The formulae to be employed are (2, 3), (4, 5 ). Solution .

***, sin. a sin. B tan. fl cos. B

In this case each of the things required has two values, because an arc and its supplement have the same sine. Hence two distinct triangles may be found from the same data; this is called the ambiguous case of right-angled spherical triangles.

Case V. Given a side b with the adjacent angle C, to find the hypotenuse a , the side c, and the angle B. These are to be found by (4, 5), (6, 7), (9, 10).

In addition to what has been said in regard to the arcs or angles sought being less or greater than quadrants, it may be useful to remember, that when the thing to be found by the formulae is either a tangent or a cosine, and when of the tangents or cosines employed in its computation, one only is an obtuse angle, the angle required is also obtuse. In what follows we shall consider R = 1.

Oblique-Angled Spherical Triangles.

24. Before entering on these, we shall resolve this problem.

PROBLEM. Let M, N, P be given quantities, and x an unknown arc or angle; it is proposed to find x from this equation:

M cos. x + N sin. x = P.

****Let us assume M = v cos. φ, N ≡t v sin. p; where v denotes a number, and φ an angle, both to be determined. Our equation may now be expressed thus.

v (cos. φ cos. x -fsin. <p sin. x) = P; p hence v cos. (x — φ) — P, and cos. (x — p) = -.

XT . t>sin. φ N ...

r vcos.φ M v , anj ν _ _M N_

- cos. φ~ sin. φ P P

Therefore cos. (tr∙—p) = — cos. φ = — sin. p....(2)

The angle φ is determined by the first equation, and the angle (x — φ) by the second j therefore x = (x — φ) -f∙ p is found.

If we assume M = v sin. φ, and N = » cos. φ. we have t> (sin. φ cos. x -j-cos. p sin. x) — P, and v sin. (x -f- φ) — P; then cot. p= (1)

P p and sin. (x -j- φ) = ~ sin. φ — — cos. φ (2)

Thus φ and x — (x -∣- φ) — φ are both determined.

The assumptions tan. φ or cot. φ are evidently always possible, since an arc φ may be found whose tangent or cotangent shall have any real value whatever.
[7:21:385]

25. There are six cases of oblique-angled triangles, which may be resolved by the formulae which have been investigated; but in some cases they will be modified so as to adapt them to logarithmic calculation.

This solution has been found in article 18.

Case II. Given two sides a and b, and the angle A opposite.

(1.) The angle B may be found from formula II. thus:

_. τ , sin. Asin. b Sm. B= i sin. «

The affection of B is ambiguous, unless it can be determined by the rule A, 4- B is greater or less than 180°, according as a -∣- b is greater or less than 180° (art. 23).

(2.) The side c is to be found from this equation: [cos. b] cos. e -f- [sin. b cos. A] sin. c — cos. a.

Comparing this with the equation of art. 24, viz. M cos. x -fN sin. x = P, we have

M = cos. b, N = sin. b cos. A, P = cos. a; and following the analysis by which the angle x has been there determined, we find that if

Tan. p = tan. b cos. A,

, . . cos. α cos. a cos. a sin. ®

then cos. (c — φ)= . r = . -. ζ.

' cos.o sin. o cos. A

The first value of cos. (c— φ ) being the more simple, is to be used. The arcs c — φ and φ being now both known, c is known.

*****3. To find the angle C, we have, from formula III., [cos. ⅛] cos. C -∣- [cot. A] sin. C = cot. a sin. b.

Here, referring to article 24, we have M = cos. b, N=cot. A, P ≡ cot. a sin. b ; therefore, assuming cot. A Ian.©— z , cos. b we have

„ . , cot. a sin. b sin. a

Cos. (C — φ) = cot. a tan. b cos. f — -^∙ ∙

From either of these formulae the angle C is dctcrmined.

Case III. Given the sides a, b, with the included angle 'C, to find the angles A, B, and side c.

(1.) The angles A, B, may be found from two of Napier’s analogies in article 22. Thu3 we have

T∙"l<Λ+≡) = oo∙-iC

τ *"∙l(∙ i -I>) = oo∙'iC⅛4⅛⅛J∙

Having now half the sum and half the difference of the angles A and B. each may be found by a known process. They may be otherwise found, by subsidiary angles, from formula I.

(2.) The side c is to be found from the equation [cos. a] cos. b -f- [sin. a cos. C] sin. 5 = cos. c.

Here we have M = cos. a, N = sin. a cos. C, P = cos. c; we therefore make tan. φ — tan. a cos. C.

Then cos. (b — φ) =;

Tan. J(α + fc) = tan. i c∙

Tan. ⅜ (a _ b) = tan. ⅜ c g∙

Half t)ιc sum and half the difference of the sides a, b being found, each is thereby determined.

(2.) The angle C is found from the formula

[sin. A cos. c] sin. B — [cos. A] cos. B = cos. C. Here M = sin. A cos. c, N = cos. A, P = cos. C. We now assume

(1.) The side b is found by this formula:

(2.) The side c is found by this formula:

[cot. π] sin. c— [cos. B] cos. c = cot. A sin. B.

Here M — cot. a, N = cos. B, P = cot. A sin. B; we therefore assume f , . cot. a Cot. ffi = e cos. B’

and have sin. (c— φ) — cot A tan. B sin. f.

(3.) The angle C is found from the formula

[sin. B cos. λ] sin. C — [cos. B] cos. C = cos. A. Here M = sin. B cos. a, N ≡ cos. B, P = cos. A.

We assume cot. φ = tan. B cos. a ∏., . , . cos. A sin. β

lhen sin. (c — C) = κ— c .

' r ' cos. B

Case VI. Given the three angles A, B, C, to find the sides a, b, c.

Then cot. ⅛ a = zg r r, cot. ⅜ b = - ε nλ , i cos. (S — A) * (cos. b — B)

These formulae arc altogether analogous to those by which the angles are found from the sides. This case rarely occurs in the application of spherics to astronomy.

The analytical artifice of subsidiary angles, by which the formulae are adapted to logarithmic calculation, corresponds to the resolving of an oblique spherical triangle into two right-angled triangles, by an arc of a great circle drawn from its vertex perpendicular to its base.

For the application of spherical trigonometry, see Practical Astronomy, chap. i. (vol. iv. page 63).

The treatises on trigonometry are innumerable. The most considerable is that of Cagnoli, in Italian, of which there is a French translation. On the history of trigonometry, and the progress of its improvement, the reader will find the most ample information in Delambre, Histoire de l'Astronomie Ancienne, Histoire de l'Astronomie du Moyen Age, and Histoire de l'Astronomie Moderne. See also his Astronomie Théorique et Pratique, vol. i. chap. 10.
