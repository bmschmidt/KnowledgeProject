THOTH, or Theut (called by the Phoenicians Tarnst, by the Greeks Hermes, and by the Romans Mercury), was a Phoenician of very superior talents, and one of the civilizers of mankind. He was prime minister to Osiris, whom, after his death, he deified; and he was himself deified by his countrymen the Egyptians, for the benefits which he had rendered to the human race.
