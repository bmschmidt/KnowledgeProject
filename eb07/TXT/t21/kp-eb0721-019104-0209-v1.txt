THAXTED, a town of the hundred of Dunmow, in the county of Essex, forty-seven miles from London. It is a place of little trade, though formerly much cutlery was made there. It has a spacious church, built by John duke of Lancaster, and several chapels for dissenters. It was formerly a borough, and more considerable than it is at present. There is a market on Friday. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 2045, and in 1831 to 2293.
