KOEI-TCHOO, a province of China, situated near the south-western extremity of the empire, bordering on Yunan. It is of a much more unequal surface than the rest of the empire, and full of precipitous mountains, inhabited by barbarous and independent races, from whom the Chinese emperor is scarcely able to collect the moderate tribute which he exacts, even by the aid of all the forts and garrisons which he is obliged to maintain. The mountains yield gold, silver, copper, and mercury. Sir George Staunton estimates the population at 9,000,000.
