KIRK, a Saxon term, signifying the same with church.

Kirk- Sessions, the name of a petty ecclesiastical judicatory in Scotland. Each parish, according to its extent, is divided into several districts, every one of which has its own elder and deacon to oversee it. A consistory of the ministers, elders, and deacons of a parish, forms a kirksession; and these meet once a week, the minister being their moderator, but without a negative voice. It regulates matters relating to public worship, catechising, visitations, and the like. It judges in lesser matters of scandal, but greater, as adultery, are left to the presbytery; and in all cases an appeal lies from it to the presbytery. Kirk-sessions have likewise the care of the poor and poorâ€™s funds.
