KIANGNAN, a province of China, which may be considered as the centre of the navigation, wealth, and commerce of this great empire. It is bounded on the east by the sea, on the north by Shantung, on the west by Honan, and on the south by Tchekiang and Quangse√∂. This extensive province is well watered, being traversed by the great rivers Hoangho and Yang-tse-kiang, previous to their junction with the sea, and by their numerous tributaries, which give it an easy communication with all the provinces and districts of the interior. It is also crossed by the great canal which leads to Pekin; and its waters are accordingly covered w ith a continuous line of barks, carrying to their various markets the different productions of the country. Nankeen is the capital, which surpasses Pekin in extent, and even in population. It contains many other cities, which, in point of size and wealth, might have been the capitals of empires. Industry and manufactures flourish to a great extent in this province; and the silks, japanned goods, ink, paper, and other articles, bear a higher price. There are manufactories of salt on the sea coast; and it contains also quarries of marble. The official estimate of the population given to Sir George Staunton was twenty-two millions, which is probably one of the boastful exaggerations of the Chinese.
