KOMORN, a circle of the province of the Farther Danube, in the Austrian kingdom of Hungary. It extends over 1167 square miles, comprehending one city, five market-towns, and 156 villages and hamlets, with 12,256 houses. The inhabitants are two-thirds Catholics, and one-third reformed Protestants. The capital is a city of the same name, at the junction of the Waag with the Danube. It is strongly fortified, and has five Catholic, one Lutheran, one Reformed, and one Greek church, with 1400 houses, and 11,200 inhabitants. A great part of the city was thrown down by an earthquake in 1763, and again by another in 1783, but the damages were speedily [7:12:756] r epaired. There are manufactures of woollen cloth, several tanneries, and the fishery on the Danube gives employment to many persons. There is a strong fort on the point of land where the two rivers meet.
