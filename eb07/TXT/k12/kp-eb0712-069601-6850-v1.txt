KENTIGERN, St, or St Mungo, a famous saint of the Catholic church, who flourished in Scotland in the sixth century, and is said to have been of the royal blood of both Scotch and Picts, being the son of Thametis, the daughter of Loth king of the Picts, by Eugene HI. king of Scotland. The bishoprics of Glasgow and St Asaph were founded by him in 560. He obtained the appellation of Mungo from the affection of his tutor St Serf or Servanus s bishop of Orkney, who called him Mongah, which in the Norwegian language signifies dear friend.
