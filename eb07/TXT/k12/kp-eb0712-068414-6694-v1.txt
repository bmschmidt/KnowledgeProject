KEEN, or Kaynduem River. This great river, which is supposed to have its source in the mountains whieh divide Assam from Ava, is the second river in the Burman empire. It enters Ava from the north-west, and falls into the Irrawaddy at Miondap, in lat. 21. 45. N. It is liable to floods during the rainy season; and, except during this season, its mouth is much obstructed by sand-banks covered with long grass and reeds. Being shallow, it is only navigable for flat-bottomed boats. Its banks are occupied by the rude and inoffensive tribes of the Kayns or Carianers. The adjacent country is said to be mountainous, and covered with wood. It has never been explored by Europeans.
