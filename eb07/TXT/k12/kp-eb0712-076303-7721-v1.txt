KOUBCABEIA, a considerable town of Darfoor, in Central Africa. It constitutes the key of the western road through the country, and is the depot of all the merchandise brought from the west. A market is held here twice a week, the chief medium for goods of small value being salt. The inhabitants obtain this article by collecting and boiling the earth of those places where horses, asses, and other animals, have long been stationary. This market is celebrated for the quantity of toheas, or coarse cotton cloths, here disposed of, and for the manufacture, if such it may be called, of leather sacks for corn, water, and other purposes. The inhabitants are a mixture of Foorians, who speak their own language; Arabs, Fellatahs, and individuals from Bengoo, and other western countries.
