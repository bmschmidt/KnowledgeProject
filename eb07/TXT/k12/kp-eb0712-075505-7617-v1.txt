KOLYVAN, a province of Asiatic Russia, in the government of Tomsk, situated on the upper course of the Obi. It is chiefly distinguished by the abundant copper mines within its limits, containing a considerable proportion both of silver and gold. These mines were discovered in 1727 by Îœ. Demidoff, who. when he began to work them in 1730, publicly extracted the copper, but was obliged clandestinely to separate the gold. This fraud being discovered by a German, the mines were confiscated to the use of the government; and, according to the accounts of the board of mines, these works, from 1725 to 1786, produced about 3,500,000 pounds of silver, and 48,000 pounds of gold. The town of Kolyvan is small, situated on the right bank of the Berda, near its junction with the Obi. Long. 81. 50. E. Lat. 54. 48. N.
