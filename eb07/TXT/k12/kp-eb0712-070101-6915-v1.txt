KERAH, or Haweeza, and by the Turks called Karasu, a considerable river of Persia, which takes its rise in the mountains of Ardelan, in Kurdistan, from the junction of numerous streams. It makes its way through the plain of Kermanshaw, greatly increased by the contribution of two considerable rivers, the Kazawur and the Gamasu; after which it flows with a furious course through Chusistan, receiving in its progress the accession of many streams. It flows onward to the ruins of Shus, and the city of Haweeza, and enters the Shut-el-Arab about twenty miles below Korna.
