KUPH, an extensive ruined village of Syria, which appears to be the remains of a large town. The buildings appear like magnificent palaces. The style of architecture is of the fourth or fifth century; and the crosses over the door show the buildings to have been Christian. Thirty-five miles south-south-west of Aleppo.
