KEITH, - James-Francis Edward, field-marshal in the Prussian service, was the younger son of William Keith, earl marisehal of Scotland, and was born in 1696. He was designed by his friends for the law; but his inclination led him to the profession of arms, and the first occasion of drawing his sword was at the age of eighteen years, when the rebellion broke out in Scotland. Through the instigation of his mother he joined Jamesâ€™s party, and was wounded at the battle of Sheriffmuir, but afterwards made his eseape to Franee. There he applied himself to military studies; and having proceeded to Madrid, he, by the interest of the Duke of Leiria, obtained a commission in the Irish brigade, then commanded by the Duke of Ormond. Heafter-wards attended the Duke of Leiria when he went as ambassador to Museovy; and, being by him recommended to the ezarina, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general, and invested with the order of the black eagle. He distinguished himself by his valour and eonduet in the Russian service, and had no inconsiderable share in the revolution whieh raised Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter the Great, to the throne. He also served in several embassies; but finding the honours of that country only asplendid species of slavery, he left the Muscovite court, and entered the Prussian service. The king of Prussia made him field-marshal of the Prussian armies, and governor of Berlin; and so far distinguished him by his confidence, as to travel in disguise with him over a great part of Germany, Poland, and Hungary. In business, Frederick made him his chief counsellor; in his diversions, his ehief eompanion. The king was much pleased with an amusement whieh the marshal invented, in imitation of the game of ehess. The latter ordered several thousand small statues of men in armour to be cast by a founder; these he would set opposite to each other, and range them in battle array, in the same manner as if he had been drawing up an army; he would then bring out a party from the wings or eentre, and show the comparative advantage or disadvantage resulting from the different draughts which he made. In this manner the king and the marshal often amused themselves, and at the same time improved their military knowledge. This brave and experieneed general, after rendering many important services in the wars of that illustrious monarch, was killed in the unfortunate affair of Hochkirehen, in the year 1758.

The family of Keith was amongst the most ancient in Europe. In 1010, the Scoteh having gained a complete victory over the Danes at Camus Town in Angus, King Malcolm II., as a reward for the signal bravery of a certain young nobleman, who pursued and killed Camus, the Danish general, bestowed on him several lands, particularly the barony of Keith in East Lothian, from whieh his posterity assumed their surname. The king also appointed him hereditary great marisehal of Scotland, whieh high office continued in his family till the year 1715, when the [7:12:686] last earl having engaged in the rebellion, forfeited his "estate and honours; and thus ended the family of Marischal, after serving their country in a distinguished capacity for above seven hundred years.
