KONKODOO, one of the three independent states into which Bambouk, a considerable territory of Western Africa, is divided. Latadoo and Bambouk are the names of the two other kingdoms, the latter having given its name to the whole territory. The country is crowded with steep mountains, composed of a species of red granite, but they are clothed with vegetation to the very summits; and the villages, which are built in delightful glęns, present a most romantic appearance. Gold is distributed in larger or smaller quantities throughout Konkodoo, and the chief occupation of the inhabitants seems to be the collecting of the precious metal, which they separate from grosser matter by mechanical processes. This kingdom is governed by a chief; but the Siratik, the regal title of the sovereign of Banιbouk, enjoys an honorary superiority.
