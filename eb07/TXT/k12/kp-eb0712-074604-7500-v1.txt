KNOLLES, Richard, was born in Northamptonshire about the middle of the sixteenth century, and educated at Oxford, after which he was appointed master of the free school at Sandwich in Kent. He composed Gram-maticoe Latinae, Groecae, et Hebraicoe, compendium, cum radicibus, London, 1606, and sent many excellent scholars to the universities. He also spent twelve years in compiling a history of the Turks, which was first printed in 1610. It is called the General History of the Turks, from the first beginning of that nation to the rising of the Ottoman family. He died in 1610, and this history has been since continued by several hands; but the best continuation is that by Paul Ricaut, consul at Smyrna, folio, London, 1680. Knolles wrote also the Lives and Conquests of the Ottoman Kings and Emperors to the year 1610, which was not printed till after his death in 1621, to which time it was continued by another hand; and, lastly, a Brief Discourse of the greatness of the Turkish empire, and wherein the greatness of the strength thereof consisted!.
