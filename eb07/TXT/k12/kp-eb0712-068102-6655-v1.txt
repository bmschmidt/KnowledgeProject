KARTUEL, or Kartalinia, one of the four provinces which constitute the state of Georgia, and the most western of the whole, bordering on InÎ¹meritia. It occupies both banks of the Kur, and comprehends the greater part of the ancient Iberia; but it no longer boasts of the fine cities and handsome public buildings which it contained in the time of Strabo. The repeated revolutions which it has experienced since that period, and, in particular, the destructive inroads of the Lesghaes, have completely changed the face of the country, and almost exterminated its population. The few inhabitants who remain are to be found, as in ancient times, in the southern and middle mountains of Eastern Caucasus. They live chiefly by agriculture, and have their houses almost on the very tops of the hills.
