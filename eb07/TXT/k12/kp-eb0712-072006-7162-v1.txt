KINCARDINESHIRE, or the Mearns, a county in Scotland, situated between 56. 43. and 57. 5. north latitude, and between 1. 47. and 2. 30. west longitude from Greenw ich. It is bounded on the east by the German Ocean; on the north by Aberdeenshire, from which it is divided along the greater part of the boundary by the river Dee; and on the west and south by Forfarshire, from which it is divided by the river North Esk. The boundary along the shore of the German Ocean extends to thirty-two miles, being the greatest length of the county; and the greatest breadth from east to wmst is twenty-four miles; the superficial contents being 360 square miles, or about 243,444 English acres.

The cultivated parts of the county form three principal divisions; the Howe of the Mearns, the Coast-side, and Dee-side. The Howe of the Mearns, a continuation of the great valley of Strathmore, is divided from the Dee-side district by the Grampian Mountains, which stretch, from west to east, through the whole breadth of the county, gradually declining in elevation, until they disappear in the level ground near the sea, between Stonehaven and Aberdeen. The greater part of this district is in a state of high cultivation, and the face of the country is diversified and ornamented by thriving plantations. The ground in many places is composed of a bright-red clay, which gives the surface, when newly ploughed, a very peculiar appearance. The great road from Perth to Aberdeen through Strathmore traverses this district. The Coast-side district, from the river North Esk to Stonehaven, contains, with some intermixture of inferior ground, the most productive land in the county. The road from Montrose to Aberdeen runs through this division. Notwithstanding the vicinity of the ocean, some thriving plantations are to he seen; and, almost close to the shore, there are trees of considerable magnitude, especially at Brotherton, where a finely-terraced old garden,"although within reach of the sea spray, is remarked as being one of the best and most productive in this part of the country. From Bervie to Stonehaven, a distance of ten miles, the shore is high and bold, presenting to the ocean, along the whole line, a perpendicular face of rock, from 100 to 250 feet in height. The most conspicuous of this range of rocks is Fowlsheugh, well known as the rendezvous, during summer, of innumerable flocks of sea-fowl of various kinds. In the face of the rock are various caverns, and natural arches and galleries, of great extent and magnificence. From Stonehaven northw ard to the river Dee the shore is also bold and rocky; but the face of the country is generally of a very inferior character to that of the same district south of Stonehaven, just described. The appearance of a great part of this tract is as uninviting as can well be imagined. In the neighbourhood of Stonehaven, however, and in some other places, part of the ground is in a state of high productiveness; and, even in the most barren and forbidding parts, great improvements have recently been made, and the progress of cultivation is such as to promise at no distant period a total change on the face of this part of the country. The Dec-side district, forming the third division of the cultivated part of the county, is situated on both sides of the Dee, and extends along the south bank of that river, from the sea westward, for about thirteen miles, and afterwards along both banks for nine or ten miles further, embracing also the valley of the Feugh. Some of the land in this district is fertile, and produces good crops; but a great part of the ground is still in little better than a state of nature, although to a considerable extent capable of, and in many places in progress towards, cultivation. In this district, trees have been planted to a greater extent than in any other part of the county, and the climate is peculiarly favourable to the growth of timber. The plantations greatly embellish the face of the country; and at many points, especially in the neighbourhood of the rising valley of Banchory, the prospect along the Dee is rich and beautiful. Plantations of firs extend in some places to the summits of the adjoining hills.

These three divisions, comprehending the more level and cultivated parts of the county, extend to about two thirds of the whole surface. The other third consists of the eastern range of the Grampian Mountains, by which the Dee-side district is divided from the Howe of the Mearns. This elevated region is exceedingly sterile and rugged; but in some of the glens through which the mountain-streams flow, there are spots of great natural beauty. On one of these spots, in a romantic situation, stands the shooting lodge of Glendye. The most prominent of the Grampian Mountains in this county are, Mount-Battock, which rises to nearly 3500 feet above t [7:12:721]
