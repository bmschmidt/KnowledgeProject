KUBBEER, a large salt lake, or rather marsh, of Persia, in the province of Irak. It runs from east to west about 150 miles, and is in some places thirty-five miles in breadth. There are roads through this morass, but they are not easy distinguished, and the unfortunate wanderer who misses them is in danger either of perishing in the swamp or of dying from thirst and heat. The road from Koom to Tehran crosses a part of this morass.
