KERGUELENâ€™S Land, or Island of Desolation, an island in the South Indian Ocean, discovered by Kerguelen, a Frenchman, and visited in the year 1779 by Captain Cook. It occupies one degree and a quarter of latitude, and about two of longitude. It is almost totally destitute of vegetation, owing to the coldness and moisture of the climate; and is represented as one of the bleakest and most desolate places of the earth, the haunt of sea-birds and amphibious animals. Long. 69. 30. E. Lat. 49. 20. S.
