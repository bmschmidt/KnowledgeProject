KEW, a village of the hundred of Kingston, in the county of Surrey, six and a half miles from London, on the right bank of the Thames, over which there is a handsome bridge. It is a pleasant village, with many highly respectable houses, but chiefly distinguished for the royal palace, the favourite residence of George HI. The palace is of modern construction, built of brick faced with stone in the Gothic style. It is, however, inferior to the gardens, which are laid out with taste and judgment, and contain almost every curious vegetable production of various countries and climates. There are in these gardens a variety of temples connected with classical and historical subjects. One of the most remarkable is the Chinese pagoda, about 170 feet in height, said to be an exact copy of one in the celestial empire, from the top of which is a fine prospect over the surrounding country. The population amounted in 1801 to 424, in 1811 to 560, in 1821 to 683, and in 1831 to 837.
