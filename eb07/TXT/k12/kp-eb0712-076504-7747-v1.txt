KUBBEES, a city of Seistan, in Persia, situated on the road from Kerman to Herat, in the midst of a desert, 150 miles north-east from Kerman, and 160 north-east from Yezd, and the whole intermediate space being an arid waste, intersected with one or two ranges of mountains. There is a path through this desert, by which couriers go; but the danger of perishing is so great, that a person of this description demanded 200 rupees from Lieutenant PÃ¶ttinger, to carry a letter to his fellow-traveller, Captain Christie.
