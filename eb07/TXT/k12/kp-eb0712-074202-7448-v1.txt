KIT, in Music, the name of a small violin, of such form and dimension as to be capable of being carried in a case or sheath in the pocket. Its length, measuring from the extremities, is about sixteen inches, and that of the bow about seventeen. Small as this instrument is, its powers are co-extensive with those of the violin.

Kit- Cat-Club, an association of above thirty noblemen and gentlemen of distinguished merit, formed in 1703, for the purpose of uniting their zeal in favour of the protestant succession in the house of Hanover. I heir name was derived from Christopher Kat, a pastry cook, near the tavern where they met, in Kings Street, Westminster, who often supplied them with tarts. Old Jacob lonson was their bookseller. Their portraits were painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller.
