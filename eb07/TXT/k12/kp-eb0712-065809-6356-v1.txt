KADESH, Kadesh-barnea, or En-mishpat, in Ancient Geography, a city celebrated for several remarkable events. At Kadesh, Miriam the sister of Moses died; and here it was that Moses and Aaron, showing a distrust in Godâ€™s power, when they smote the rock at the waters of strife, were condemned to die without the consolation of entering the promised land. The king of Kadesh was one of the princes killed by Joshua. This city was given to the tribe of Judah, and was situated about eight leagues to the south of Hebron.
