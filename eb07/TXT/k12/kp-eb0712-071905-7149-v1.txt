KILSYTH, a village in the southern part of Scotland. It is situated on the public road, twelve and a half miles from Glasgow, eleven and a half fi - oÎ¹n Falkirk, [7:12:720] and sixteen from Stirling. It is a straggling, irregularly built, but populous place, containing upwards of 2000 inhabitants, who are chiefly engaged in weaving for the Glasgow manufacturers. Kilsyth is a burgh of barony, with the privilege of holding five annual fairs. Besides the parish church, there is a relief meeting-house. Kilsyth is commemorated in Scottish history by having given its name to the victory which the Marquis of Montrose gained over General Baillie in the year 1645.
