FERALIA, in Antiquity , a festival observed amongst the Romans on the 21st February, or, according to Ovid, on the 17th of that month, in honour of the manes of tlιeir deceased friends and relations.

^arro derives the word from inferi, or from fero, on account of a repast carried to the sepulchres of such as had that day the last offices rendered to them. Festus derives 1 t from ferio, on account of the victims sacrificed. Vos-ιus observes that the Romans called death fera, cruel, and that hence might arise the word feralia. Macrobius ÇSa-iurηαliα, lib. i. cap. 13), refers the origin of the ceremony ţo Numa Pompilius. Ovid, in his Fasti, goes back for its 1 ∏stιtution as far as the time of Aeneas. He adds, that on the same day a sacrifice was performed to the goddess Muta, 0r Dumb; and that the persons who officiated were an old woman and a number of attendant young girls.

During the continuance of this festival, which lasted eeven days, presents were made at the graves of the deceased, marriages were forbidden, and the temples of the gods were shut. Whilst the ceremonies continued, it was I imagined that the ghosts suffered no punishments in hell, but that their tormentors allowed them to wander round their tombs, and to feast upon the meats which their surviving friends had prepared for them.

At the feralia public feasts were sometimes given to the people, at the tombs of the rich and great, by their heirs or particular friends.

I ’ ER de Fourchette, in Heraldry, a cross having at each end a forked iron, like that formerly used by soldiers to rest their muskets on. It differs from the cross fourche, the ends of which were bent as well as forked; whereas, this has the same sort of fork fixed upon the square end. See Heraldry.
