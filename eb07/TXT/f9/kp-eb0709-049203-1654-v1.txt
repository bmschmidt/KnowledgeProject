FASCIA, in Antiquity, a thin sash which the Roman women wrapped round their bodies next to the skin, in order to make them slender. Something of this sort seems also to have been in use amongst the Grecian ladies.

Fascia, in Architecture, signifies any flat member having considerable breadth and but small projection, as the band of an architrave, larmier, and the like. In brick buildings, the juttings out of the brick beyond the windows in the several stories except the highest are called fascias or fasciae.
