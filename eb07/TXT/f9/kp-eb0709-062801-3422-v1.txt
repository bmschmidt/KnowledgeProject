FLORILEGIUM, Florilege, a name given by the Latins to what the Greeks call aν0ο ∖ ογιον, anthology, a collection of choice pieces, containing the finest and brightest things of their kind.

Florilege is also particularly used for a kind of breviary, in the Eastern church, compiled by Arcadius, for the convenience of the Greek priests and monks. The florilegium contains the general rubrics, psalter, canticles, the horologium, and the office of the feriae.
