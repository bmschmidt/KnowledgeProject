FEBRUARY, in Chronology, the second month of Numaâ€™s year. This month is not found in the calendar of Romulus, but was added to the year by Numa. It had its name from Februa, Februaca, or Februalis, all names of Juno, who presided over the purifications of women; in this month also the Lupercalia were held in honour of Juno, and women were purified by the priests of Pan Lyceus at that festival. February, in a common year, consists only of twenty-eight days; but in bissextile year it has twenty-nine, on account of the intercalary day added that year.
