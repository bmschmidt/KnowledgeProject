FANTASIA, in the Italian music, signifies fancy, and is used for a .composition, in which the composer ties himself to no particular time, but ranges according as his fancy, amidst various movements and different airs, dictates. This is also called the capricious style. Before sonatas were used, many compositions of this kind appeared, some of which even now remain.
