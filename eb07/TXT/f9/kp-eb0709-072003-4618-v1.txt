FONTINALIA, or Frontanalia, in Antiquity, a religious feast held amongst the Romans in honour of the deities who presided over fountains or springs. Varro observes that it was the custom to visit the wells on certain days, and to cast crowns into fountains. Scaliger, in his conjectures on Varro, supposes that this was not a feast of fountains in general, as Festus insinuates, but of die fountain which had a temple at Rome, near the Porta Capena, called also Porta Fontinalis ; and he adds, that it is of this fountain Cicero speaks in his second book De Legibus. The Fontinalia were celebrated on the 13th of October.
