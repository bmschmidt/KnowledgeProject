FARNOVIANS, in Ecclesiastical History, a sect of Socinians, so called from Stanislaus Farnovius, who separated from the other Unitarians in the year 1568, and was followed by several persons eminent for their learning. This sect did not last long; for having lost their chief, who died in 1615, it was scattered abroad and reduced to nothing. Farnovius was engaged by Gonesius to prefer the Arian system to that of the Socinians; and consequently asserted that Christ had been produced out of nothing bythe Supreme Being, before the creation of this terrestrial globe. His sentiments concerning the Holy Ghost are not certainly known; but it appears that he warned his disciples against paying the tribute of religious worship to the Divine Spirit.
