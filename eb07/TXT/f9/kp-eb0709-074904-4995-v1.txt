FORMALITY, as defined in the schools, is any manner in which a thing is conceived; or a manner in any object, importing a relation to the understanding by which it may be distinguished from another object-Thus animality and rationality are formalities. The Scotists made great use of formalities, in opposition to the virtualities of the Thomists.

Formalities, in matters of law, are frequently used for the formulas themselves, or the rules prescribed for judicial procedure. In contracts of strict law all the formalities must be strictly observed, as an omission of the least may ruin the whole convention.
