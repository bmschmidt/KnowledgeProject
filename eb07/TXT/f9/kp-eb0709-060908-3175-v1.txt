FITERO, a town of Spain, in the province of Navarre. It is situated on the banks of the Alhama, which, though a river of short course, is highly beneficial, by its irrigating capabilities, to the country through which it passes. The monastery of Fitero is very richly endowed; and the town, which contains 3500 inhabitants, as well as the land around it, is the property of that establishment. The whole of the people are employed in the cultivation of hemp, and in the consequent manufactures of that article. There are some warm mineral springs, which are resorted to for the cure of several complaints, and which attain to the heat of thirty-six degrees Reaumur.
