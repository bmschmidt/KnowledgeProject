FEUD, in our ancient customs, is used to signify a capital quarrel or enmity, not to be satisfied but with blood; and hence it is usually denominated deadly feud. Feud, called also feida, and faida, in the original German signifies guerrÎ±n or war. Lambert writes it feeth, and says that it signifies capitalis inimicitia, or implacable hatred.
