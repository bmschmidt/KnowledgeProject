FITCHY, in Heraldry (from the French fiehe, fixed), a term applied to a cross when the lower branch ends in a sharp point. The origin of this device is supposed to be, that the primitive Christians were accustomed to carry about crosses with them wherever they went; and when they stopped at any place on a journey, they fixed these portable crosses in the ground for the sake of devotion.
