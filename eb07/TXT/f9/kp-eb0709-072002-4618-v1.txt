FONTEVRAUD, or Fontrvraux, Order of, in Ecclesiastical History, a religious order, instituted about the latter end of the eleventh century, and taken under the protection of the holy see by Pope Pascal II. in 1106, confirmed by a bull in 1113, and invested by his successors with very extraordinary privileges. The chief of this order was a female, appointed to inspect both the monks and nuns. The order was divided into four provinces, which were those of France, Aquitaine, Auvergne, and Bretagne, in each of which they had formerly several priories.
