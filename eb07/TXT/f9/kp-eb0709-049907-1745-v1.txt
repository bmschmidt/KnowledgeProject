FELICITAS, Felicity, or Happiness, was deified by the ancient Pagans. Lucullus built a temple to this goddess, and Lepidus erected another. The Greeks paid divine worship to Macaria, daughter of Hercules, who was the same with the Felicitas of the Romans. This deity is pictured upon medals, generally with a cornucopia in one hand, and a caduccus in the other.
