FERMO, one of the delegations of the papal dominions, in Italy, 580 square miles in extent. It contains one city, eleven market-towns, and thirty villages, with 77,089 inhabitants. It is situated on the shore of the Adriatic, and on that side is fruitful in wheat, maize, pease, b≈ôans, and fruit, and produces some silk. On the western side it consists of the Appennines, and is less fertile. The capital, of the same name, is about two miles from the shore, where is Porto Fermo, whence several fisheries are carried on. The city is surrounded with walls, and contains ten churches, besides the cathedral of the archbishop, eleven monasteries, and five nunneries. The inhabitants amounted in 1816 to 19,678, and are occupied in various trades. Long. 13. 36. 21. E. Lat. 43. 10. 18. N.
