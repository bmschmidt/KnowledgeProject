FAMILIARS of the Inquisition, persons who assist in apprehending such as are accused, and carrying them to prison. They are assistants to the inquisitor, and called familiars, because they belong to his family. In some provinces of Italy they were called cross-bearers, in others the scholars of St Peter the Martyr ; and they wore a cross in front on the outside of the garment. They are properly bailiffs of the inquisition; and the office is esteemed so honourable, that in Portugal noblemen have been ambitious of belonging to it.
