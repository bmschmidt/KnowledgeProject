FOHR, or Fora, an island belonging to the kingdom of Denmark, in the German Ocean, near the mouth of the river Illwe. It extends in north latitude from 54. 41. to 54. 46. and in east longitude from 8. 19. to 8. 31. It contains one market-town, called Westerlandfohr, and sixteen villages, forming sixteen parishes, and inhabited by 5670 persons, many of them sailors. A great number of the men are occupied in taking birds for the down and feathers, whilst the females make a large quantity of warm hosiery and gloves. They are said to have been originally a colony of Frisians, and still speak the language of that people.
