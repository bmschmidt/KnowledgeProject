FORTALICE, in Scotch Law, signified anciently a small place of strength, built for the defence of the country, and which on that account was formerly reckoned inter regalia, and did not go along with the lands upon which it was situated without a special grant from the crown. Now, fortalices are carried by a general grant of the lands; and the word has become synonymous with manor-place, messuage, and the like.
