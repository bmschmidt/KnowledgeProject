FASCINATION, from the Greek βα<sκaιvuv, to fascinate or bewitch, a sort of witchcraft supposed to operate either by the eye or the tongue. Ancient writers distinguish two sorts of fascination; one performed by looking, or the efficacy of the eye, and the other by words, especially by malignant praises.

Fascination of serpents, a faculty which these animals are supposed to possess of attracting birds from the air, and making prey of them.
