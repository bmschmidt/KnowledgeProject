FASCINES, in Fortification, are a kind of faggots made of small branches of trees or brushwood, tied in three, four, five, or even six places, and are of various dimensions, according to the purposes to which they are to be applied. Those which are to be pitched over, for burning lodgments, galleries, or any other works of the enemy, should be one and a half or two feet in length; but those which are intended to form epaulements or chandeliers, to raise or fill up ditches, are made from six to ten feet in length, and from one foot to one and a fourth in thickness. Fascines are made in the following manner: Six small pickets are stuck into the ground, two and two, forming little crosses well fastened in the middle with willow bindings; on these trestles the branches are laid, and bound round with withes at every two feet. Six men are employed in making a fascine; two cut the boughs, two gather them, and the remaining two bind them. These six men can make twelve fascines every hour.
