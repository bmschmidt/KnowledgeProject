FERONIA, the pagan goddess of woods and orchards. This deity took her name from the town of Feronia, situated at the foot of Mount Soracte in Italy, where a wood and temple were consecrated to her worship. Both are mentioned by Virgil in the catalogue of Turnusâ€™s forces. Strabo relates that those who sacrificed to this goddess walked barefoot upon burning coals, without being hurt. Feronia was the guardian deity of freed men, who received their cap of liberty at her temple.
