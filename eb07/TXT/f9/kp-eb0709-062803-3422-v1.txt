FLORINIANI, or Floriani, a sect of heretics of the second century, so denominated from its author Florinus, or Florianus, a priest of the Roman Catholic church, deposed along with Blastus for his errors. Florinus had, along with Irenaeus, been a disciple of St Polycarp. He made God the author of evil; or rather asserted that the things forbidden by God are not evil, but of his own appointment. The Floriani had also other names given them. Philastrius says they were the same with the Car-pophorιans ; and they were also called soldiers, milites quia į militaribus f u eru η t. St Irenaeus calls them Gnostics; bt Epιphanιus, Phτbιonites ; and Theodoret, Barbarites, on account of the impurities of their lives; whilst others call them Aaccheaηs, and Coddians.
