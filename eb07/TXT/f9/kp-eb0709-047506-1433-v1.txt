FACTITIOUS, any thing made by art, in opposition to that which is the production of nature. Thus, factitious cinnabar is opposed to native cinnabar.

F/ACTOR, in Commerce, is an agent employed by merchants residing at other places, to buy or sell goods, negotiate bills, or transact any kind of business on their account, and entitled to a certain allowance for his trouble.

A supercargo differs from a factor in this, that the business of the former is limited to the care of a particular cargo; he goes along with it, and generally returns when ns business is completed; whereas the latter has a fixed residence abroad, and executes business for different merchants.

Factor, in Multiplication, a name given to the multiplier and multiplicand, because they constitute the product.
