FIDES, Faith, or Fidelity, one of the virtues deified by die Pagans. She had a temple near the capitol, founded by Numa Pompilius; but no animals were immolated, nor was any blood spilt, in her sacrifices. During the performance of her rites, her priests appeared in white vestments, with their heads and hands covered with linen, to show that fidelity ought to be sacred.
