FLAMINIA Via, an ancient Roman road, constructs by C. Flaminius, during his censorship, 220 b. c. Proceeding from Rome through Etruria in a direct line o Narnia, now Narni, in Umbria, it was divided into two [7:9:613] branches, the one to the east leading through Terni and Spoleto to Foligno, where it met the other, which passed through Careoli and JBevagηa. It then continued its course to Nuceria, where it again branched off in two directions, ffie one passing through the district of Picenum to Ancona, and along the coast of the Adriatic to Fanuιn Fortunae, Fαno, where it met the other, which followed the more direct line of Intercisa or Furlo, and Forum Sempronii or possornbrone. It did not go beyond Ariminum. (Bergier, Hid. des Grands Chemins.')
