FAIR Isle, an island belonging to Zetland, lying between that group of islands and the Orkneys, extending fully three miles in length by about two in breadth, and of an oblong form. It is quite mountainous, with a precipitous and dangerous coast, which is only accessible upon the south-eastern side. It is inhabited; but the soil chiefly affords pasturage for sheep.
