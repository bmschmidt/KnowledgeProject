FAENZA, a city of Italy, in the delegation of Ravenna, in the papal dominions. It is situated on a plain watered by the river Lamona, from which a canal is formed to join the Po Primero. It contains, besides a cathedral, twenty-eight churches, eight monasteries, and eight nunneries, with 14,000 inhabitants, who are employed in silk and other manufactures. At this place the invention of porcelain was introduced; and hence, in most of the languages of Europe, that commodity has obtained the name of the city. It was the birth-place of the celebrated Torricelli, the disciple of Galileo. Long. 11. 36. E. Lat. 44. 21. N.
