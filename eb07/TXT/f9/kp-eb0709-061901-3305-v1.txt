FLEMINGIANS, or Flandrians, in Ecclesiastical History, a sect of rigid Anabaptists, who acquired this name in the sixteenth century, by way of distinction from the Wαterlandiαns. In consequence of some dissensions among the Flemingians relative to the treatment of excommunicated persons, they were divided into two sects, distinguished by the appellations of Elandrians and Eriesland- ¶«, who differed from each other in their manners and discipline. But in process of time many of these came over to the moderate community of the Waterlandians, whilst tlιose who continued separate still retained the name of the old Flemingians or Flandrians. They maintained the opinion of Menno with respect to the incarnation of Christ; alleging that his body was produced by the creative power of the Holy Ghost, and not derived from his mother Mary.
