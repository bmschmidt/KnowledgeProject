FOUNT, or Font, among printers, a set or quantity of characters or letters of each kind, cast by a letter-founder, and sorted. Thus, we say, a founder has cast a fount of pica, of english, and of pearl; meaning that he has cast a set of characters of these kinds.

A complete fount not only includes the running letters, but also large and small capitals, single letters, double letters, points, commas, lines, and numeral characters. See Printing and Type-Making.
