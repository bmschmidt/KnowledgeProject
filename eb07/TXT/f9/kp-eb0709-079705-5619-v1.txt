FOWEY, a market-town and seaport of the county of Cornwall, in the hundred of Powder, 239 miles firom Lon don. The harbour, deemed the best on that part of the coast, is formed by the river Fowey, which there empties itself into the channel. There is space and depth of water for 1000 vessels. It has, however, but little trade, except that which in the few months of summer consists in the catching of pilchards, which, though a casual, is sometimes a source of great profit. The mouth of the river is defended by several forts of various dates. It is governed by a mayor, recorder, and eight aidermen, and returns two members to the House of Commons, chosen by the inhabitant householders. The population amounted in 1801 to 1155, in 1811 to 1457, in 1821 to 1455, and in 1831 to 1767.
