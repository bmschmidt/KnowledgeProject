FERULA, a little wooden pallet or slice, reputed the schoolmaster’s sceptre, wherewith he chastises the boys by striking them on the palms of the hands. The word is Latin, and has also been used to denote the prelate’s crosier and staff It is supposed to be formed from the Latin ferire, to strike. Under the eastern empire the ferula was the emperor’s sceptre, as is seen on different me· dals. It consists of a long stem or staff, having a flat square head. The use of the ferula is very ancient among the Greeks, who used to call their princes vaζ∂r t Mfοζο ∣ , or ferula-bearers.

In the ancient eastern church, ferula or narthex signified 1 place separated from the church, in which the penitents or the catechumens of the second order, called auscultantes, α ∙^α.μaτo , .ο ∣ , were kept, as not being allowed to enter the church; and as the persons therein were under penance or discipline, hence the name of the place. Sub ferula erant ecclesioe.
