FACE, the surface or first side which a body presents to the eye. Thus, we say, the face of the earth, of the waters, and the like; polyhedrons have several faces ; a die or cube has six faces. Face is particularly used for the visage of an animal, especially of man, and comprehends, in the latter, all that part of the head which is not covered with long hair. The Latins call it facies, vultus, os. .
