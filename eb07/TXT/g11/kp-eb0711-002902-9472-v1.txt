GUIMARAENS, a town of Portugal, on the small river Ave, in the province of Entre-Duero-e-Minho. It is distinguished by its manufactures of linens, from which they produce damask table-linen and napkins of very beautiful descriptions, and make the best of their sewing thread. It has also fabrics of swords and cutlery, which are reputed to be of steel unusually well tempered; a property attributed to the waters being well calculated to assist the process. This town was formerly the residence of the kings of Portugal. It now contains 1480 houses, and a population of 7400 souls.
