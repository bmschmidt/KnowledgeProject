GYNAeCOCRATUMENI, an ancient people of Sarmatia Europaea, inhabiting the eastern banks of the river Tanais, near its opening into the Palus Maeotis, and so called, because they had no women among them, or rather, perhaps, because they were under the dominion of women. The word is formed from γυvη, woman, and κgαroυμs∣∕oj, the participle of ×ξοοτeω, I overcome.
