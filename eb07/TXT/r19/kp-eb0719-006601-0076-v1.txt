RAMPOORA a town of Hindustan, in the province of Gujerat, and district of Chalawara. This place had formerly a respectable fort, which was destroyed in 1805. In the neighbourhood are many pallias or stones, erected to the memory of persons who have fallen in defence of the village. These monuments are also erected in honour of females who have sacrificed themselves to the memory of their deceased husbands.
