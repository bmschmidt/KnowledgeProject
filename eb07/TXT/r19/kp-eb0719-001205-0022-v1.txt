RAGMANâ€™S Roll, so called, as some think, from one Ragimund a legate in Scotland, who calling before him all the beneficed clergyman in that kingdom, caused them on oath to give in the true value of their benefices, according to which they were afterwards taxed by the court of Rome; and this roll, amongst other records, being taken from the Scotch by Edward I. was delivered to them in the beginning of the reign of Edward III.
