RITUAL a book directing the order and manner to be observed in performing divine service in a particular church, diocese, or the like. The ancient heathens had also their rituals, which contained their rites and ceremonies to be observed in building a city, consecrating a temple or altar,
[7:19:250]

in sacrificing and deifying, in dividing the curiae, tribes, centuries, and, in general, in all their religious ceremonies. There are several passages in Catoâ€™s books De Re Rustica, which may give us some idea of the rituals of the ancients.
