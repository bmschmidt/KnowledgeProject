RUABON a large village or town of the county of Denbigh, in North Wales, 192 miles from London, and four from Wrexham. It is pleasantly situated on an elevation, and has a neat church, with some elegant monuments to the family of Sir Watkins William Wynn, whose magnificent seat of Wynnstay is near to it. The agricultural society established at this place has much contributed to the improvement of the soil and of cultivation. The population amounted in 1801 to 5598, in 1811 to 6122, in 1821 to 8556, and in 1831 to 8353; but it includes the whole parish, which comprehended five townships.
