RAN in the old English writers, means open or public robbery, so manifest as not to be denied. Ran dicitur aperta rapina quoe negari non potest. (Lamb. 125, Leg. Canut. cap. 58.) Hence it is now commonly said of one who takes the goods of another injuriously and violently, that he has snatched or taken all that he could rap and ran.
