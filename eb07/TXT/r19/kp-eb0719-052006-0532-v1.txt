RUM a species of brandy or vinous spirits, which is distilled from sugar-canes.

Rum, according to Dr Shaw, differs from simple sugar-spirit, in that it contains more of the natural flavour or essential oil of the sugar-cane; a great deal of raw juice and parts of the cane itself being usually fermented in the liquor or solution of which the rum is prepared.
