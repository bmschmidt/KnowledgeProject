RICHES a word used always in the plural number, means wealth, money, possession, or a splendid sumptuous appearance. When used to express the fortune of private persons, whether patrimonial or acquired, it signifies opulence; a term which expresses not the enjoyment, but the possession, of numerous superfluities. By the riches of a state or kingdom we mean the produce of industry, of commerce, of different incorporated bodies, of the internal and external administration of the principal members of which the society is composed.
