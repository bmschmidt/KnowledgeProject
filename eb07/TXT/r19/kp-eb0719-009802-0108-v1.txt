REGIMENT is a body of men, either horse, foot, or artillery, commanded by a colonel, a lieutenant-colonel, and a major. Each regiment of foot is divided into companies, but the number of companies differs. In Britain our regiments have generally ten companies, one of which always consists of grenadiers. Regiments of horse commonly consist of six troops, but there are some which contain nine. Dragoon regiments have generally in time of war eight troops, but in time of peace six only. Each regiment has a chaplain, quarter-master, adjutant, and surgeon. (See the article Army.)
