ROGATION Rogatio, in Roman jurisprudence, a demand made by the consuls or tribunes of the Roman people, when a law was proposed to be passed. Rogαtio is also used for the decree itself made in consequence of the people’s giving their assent to this demand; to distinguish it from a senatus consultum, or decree of the senate.

Rogation-Week, the week immediately succeeding Whitsunday; so called from the three feasts therein, viz. on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
