RASTADT a city of the grand duchy of Baden, in Germany, the capital of a bailiwick of its own name. It is situated on the river Murg, just before that stream joins the Hhine. There is a fine palace of the prince, now used as a college or gymnasium, a nunnery, an hospital, 568 houses, and 4400 inhabitants. Peace was made here in 1715; and in 1797 and 1798 a congress was held to negotiate a peace between the German empire and France, but it came to no pacific termination. It has some few small manufactures of cloth, steel wares, hosiery, and linen goods. Long. 8. 3. 5. E. Lat. 48. 50. 5. N.
