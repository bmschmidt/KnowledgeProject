ROMAGNA a province of Italy, in the popeâ€™s territories, bounded on the north by the Ferrarese, on the south by Tuscany and the duchy of Urbino, on the east by the gulf of Venice, and on the west by the Bolognese and a part of Tuscany. It is fertile in corn, wine, oil, fine fruits, and pastures. It has also mines, mineral waters, and salt-works, which make its principal revenue. Ravenna is the capital town.
