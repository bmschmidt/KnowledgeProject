REVEREND a title of respect given to ecclesiastics. The religious abroad are called reverend fathers, and abbesses, prioresses, and others reverend mothers. In England, bishops are right reverend, and archbishops most reverend. In France, before the Revolution, the bishops, archbishops, and abbots, were all alike most reverend. In Scotland, the clergy individually are reverend, a synod is very reverend, and the general assembly is venerable.
