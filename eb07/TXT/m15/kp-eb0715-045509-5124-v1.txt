MORAD, one of the head streams of the Euphrates, and the most considerable of the whole, which has its source under the walls of Bayazed, in about 38. 40. north latitude, and 43. 30. east longitude. It flows westward, and joins the northern branch near Kebban, in Mount Taurus. The valley through which this river runs yields the finest pasturage in the world. It is now abandoned to the wandering tribes.
