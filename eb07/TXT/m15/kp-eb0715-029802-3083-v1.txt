MISE, in law-books, is used in various senses. Thus it sometimes signifies costs or expenses; in which sense it is commonly used in entering of judgments in actions personal. It is also used to signify the issue to be tried on the grand assize; in which case, joining of the mise upon the mere right, is putting in issue between the tenant and demandant, the question as. to who has the best or clearest right.
