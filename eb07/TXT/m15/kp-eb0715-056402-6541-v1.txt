MORUNG, a district of Northern Hindustan, tributary to the rajah of Nepaul, situated about the 27th degree of north latitude, and bounded on the south by Bengal. It is a mountainous country, being in some parts 7000 feet higher than Bengal; and it produces very fine timber, but is yet imperfectly explored.
