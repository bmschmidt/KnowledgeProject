MICROSCOPIC OBJECTS.

If a simple and easily applied system of monochromatic illumination, that is, of illuminating objects with homogeneous light, which a prism, and consequently a lens, is not capable of dispersing or refracting in different directions, could be contrived, we should neveragain hearof compound achromatic microscopes. We believe it will be admitted, that in Sir John Herschel’s doublet of no aberration, the spherical aberration is more completely corrected than in any double or even triple achromatic object-glass. Hence it follows, that in homogeneous light such a doublet would be a better microscope than the compound lens. But in the best system of achromatic compensation that can be executed, the secondary spectrum still remains without a remedy; and hence the doublet of no aberration, in which there can be no secondary colour in homogeneous light, must be a superior instrument to the compound achromatic lens. Now, in telescopes it is impossible, except in viewing the sun’s disc,^[1. A solar telescope should never be an achromatic one, but should consist of a compound lens of no aberration, all the colours of the spectrum being corrected by the dark glass.] to work with homogeneous light; but in microscopes, where the quantity of light is in our power, it is perfectly practicable to make that quantity so great that all the yellow or red rays which it contains may give sufficient light for microscopical observations. This insulation of homogeneous light may be effected in two ways; ∖ st, by a monochromatic lamp, as proposed and constructed by Sir David Brewster; c ½dly, by the absorption of coloured media; and, 3dly, by the prism.

The monochromatic lamp is shown in the annexed figure, where AB is a lamp having its globe A filled with diluted alcohol, which descends gradually through the tube C, into a thin platina or metallic cup, in which it burns. A strong heat is kept up by a spirit lamp L enclosed in a dark lanthorn, and when the diluted alcohol is inflamed, it will burn with a fierce and powerful yellow flame. If the flame should not be perfectly yellow, or rather of a nankeen colour, owing to an excess of alcohol, a small proportion of salt thrown into the cup D will have the same effect as a farther dilution of the alcohol. Sometimes a little blue light will be found mixed with the yellow, but this may be easily absorbed by a piece of yellow glass placed on any part of the microscope through which the rays pass. Although this light is feeble compared with that of white flames, yet, by using larger lenses for condensing it, it is quite easy to obtain a pencil sufficiently powerful for all microscopic observations.^[2. Edinburgh Transactions, voL ix. p. 435.]

A stronger flame may be produced by using a gas lamp, or, what is still better, a portable gas one containing compressed gas. This gas, when rushing out in a full stream, explodes when burned with atmospheric air, emitting much heat, and a faint bluish and reddish light. As the force of the issuing gas is sufficient to blow out the flame, a contrivance for sustaining it becomes necessary. The method which we contrived for this purpose is shown in the annexed figure, where PQ is the main body of the lamp, MN the principal burner, and A the screw which opens the main cock. A small gas tube abc, communicating with the main burner, terminates above the burner, and has a short tube de moveable up and down within it, but so [7:15:52] as to be gas light. This tube de, closed at d, communicates with the hollow ring fg, in which four apertures are perforated so as to throw their jets of gas to the apex of a cone whose base is fg. When the gas is made to issue from the burner Μ, it rushes also into the tube abcdg, and issues in four small flames at the apertures in the ring fg ; and the height of these flames is regulated by the stopcock at. b. The explosive mixture of air and gas which rushes up through the ring is sustained in combustion by these small flames, through which it passes. A broad collar, made of coarse cotton-wick, and thoroughly soaked in a saturated solution of common salt, is fixed on a ring h ; and when the bluish flame of the explosive mixture rises above h, it will be converted by the salted collar into a strong mass of homogeneous yellow light. A hollow cylinder of sponge, with numerous projecting tufts, may be substituted for the cotton collar, or a collar of asbestos cloth might be used, and supplied from a capillary fountain containing a saturated solution of salt.^[3. Edinburgh Journal of Science, new series, No. I. p. 108.]

When the few blue rays which sometimes mingle themselves with this yellow light are absorbed, every part of the light will be found to have a definite refrangibility greateι∙ than any other artificial light that can be produced. The minutest objects, and the smallest type, will appear perfectly distinct in this light when seen or read through the largest possible angle of the greatest dispersive prism, an irrefragable proof of the perfect homogeneity of the light.

2. The second method of producing homogeneous light, and by far the simplest and most easily applicable to microscopes, is that of absorption; and the best rays to leave unabsorbed or insulated are the red. It requires some experience and scientific knowledge of the action of different absorbing media to select those which will leave the narι'owestandbrightestband of the red space in the spectrum. We have now under our microscope (a grooved sphere of garnet executed by Mr Blackie^[4. This sphere, which we have already mentioned, is made of the purest garnet, and is executed in the most admirable manner; and though we cannot say that we see any defect in it, yet if the groove were still deeper, both its spherical and achromatic aberration would be diminished.]), two scales of a moth lying in sulphuric acid, and covering each other. With solar light the spaces between the lines glitter with all the hues of the rainbow; but when a thickish plate of red mica is combined with another plate of red glass, and placed beneath the object, all these colours instantly disappear, and a perfection of vision is obtained, which can be disturbed only by the very small portion of spherical aberration which must exist in the sphere, and which an increased depth of the groove would render almost insensible. Blue glasses, and green and yellow, as well as coloured fluids, may be successfully used in narrowing the range of refrangibility of the red space.

3. The third method, or that of prismatic refraction, is perhaps the surest and the best method, of obtaining homogeneous light with the smallest extent of refrangibility. A certain effect may be produced by small prisms; but in order to have a perfect apparatus, the microscope should form part of the apparatus for examining the lines of the solar spectrum; that is, it should screw into the eyepiece of the telescope, in front of the object-glass of which is placed a fine large prism, for forming the spectrum within the telescope. By this method, which we have put to the test of experiment, microscopical observations can be carried on with an accuracy and satisfaction which nothing can exceed. We enjoy the luxury of perfectly monochromatic vision, which the most perfect achromatic compensation cannot give; and while we have the spherical aberration corrected, we have no secondary colours, and none of the imperfections of vision which must arise in transmitting light through six or eight lenses of plate and flint glass.

Although we hope that the scientific reader will admit that the preceding views are ‘demonstrably correct, yet Dr Goring has pronounced a most unfavourable opinion of the system of monochromatic illumination.^[5. Edinburgh Journal of Science, new series, No. IX. p. 52.] We have already endeavoured to convert him from this heresy, and hoped that we had succeeded;^[6. ibid. p. 143.] but in the Micrographia, just published, he has devoted a whole chapter to the reproduction and support of his former views.^[7. Page 73.] We shall therefore again examine his objections in their order, as they obstruct the progress of improvement among those who justly admire Dr Goring’s ingenuity and knowledge in every thing which relates to the microscope.

1. Dr Goring’s first objection to monochromatic illumination is, that it is too weak, and must be about one seventh of the whole beam of light. This we are not disposed to dispute; but Dr Goring is too well acquainted with the resources of optical science, to forget that this monochromatic seventh of a beam of light may be made seven times more intense than the whole beam. The objection, however, does not apply to the solar spectrum, for one seventh of the sun’s light is too intense for any eye to bear.

2. The second objection of our author is, that the colours of the spectrum, when separated by the prism, are actually separated into different colours when they are refracted in oblique pencils by a microscope. If this observation is correct, then we must denounce the prism that produced such a spectrum as utterly useless. Dr Goring, however, conceives his observation and his prism to be good, and endeavours to explain the result by referring to Sir David Brewster’s analysis of the spectrum, in which it is shown that white light exists at every point of it; but this white light, which has been rendered visible by absorption, cannot be decomposed by refraction of any kind, as it consists of red, yellow, and blue rays, of the same refrangibility. Such white light is the light that is wanted for the microscope; and there can be little doubt that absorptive media will yet be discovered to effect its insulation in sufficient quantity for practical purposes.

3. Another objection to monochromatic light is, that it will not show the real colours of microscopic bodies. This is true; but the object of the microscope is not to find out colours, but structures. A common glass lens, with common light, will let the observer have all that he wants of the colours of objects; and when he has learned this, he will then gladly avail himself of coloured light for more important purposes. We can truly say, that though we have wrought with the microscope for thirty years, we do not at present recollect a single case where we required to know any thing of the precise colours of minute bodies. Notwithstanding this discussion, Dr Goring concludes his chapter with the following observation, in which we entirely concur. “A monochromatic light, therefore, being once obtained in a sufficient state of intensity for practical purposes, bids fair to conduct us to the highest perfection of which aplanatic object-glasses and magnifiers are susceptible.” It may be proper to add, that the best system of compound achromatic object-glasses now in use would be freed of all their secondary colours, by using monochromatic light; and they may be also greatly improved by employing suitable coloured media to absorb what are called the outstanding rays in an achromatic combination.
[7:15:53]

CHAP. VI.—ON THE PREPARATION OF THE OBJECT AND THE EYE FOR MICROSCOPICAL OBSERVATIONS.

In using lenses of short focus, either singly or in doublets and triplets, the object is so near the lens, and its thickness, even when very small, forms’such a considerable part of its distance from the nearest refracting surface, that any bend or want of flatness in the object completely interferes with the distinct vision of its parts. When the object will bear pressure, the best way is to lay above it a thin transparent film, with perfectly parallel and polished surfaces, such as a splinter of New Holland topaz, a thin plate of sulphate of lime, or a film of mica. If these plates are a little less thick than the distance between the lens and the object, a little bees-wax should be interposed between the" brass setting of the lens and the plate, so that the lens in the act of adjustment would press the wax against the plate, and the plate against the object, till distinct vision is obtained. The object should be placed upon a deeply curved concave surface.

The proper flattening of the object, when it is tender, may be effected by pressing a thick balsam above it, and allowing the lens to dip into the balsam. If the surface of the lcns is flat, its magnifying power will suffer no diminution.

When grooved spheres are used, such as the garnet one above mentioned, the object requires to be very near its surface. It should therefore be placed in a concave lens of glass, of a little greater radius than the sphere, and pressed into the concave form by interposing a narrow strip of a thin film of mica, and, if necessary, pieces of wax or India-rubber, as before; the pieces filling up the space between the lens and the mica, so as not to interfere with the part of the object under examination.

If a diminution of the magnifying power can be permitted, a fluid maybe placed between the concave object-plates and the grooved sphere, and the chromatic aberrati on greatly reduced. By the interposition of a fluid a grooved diamond sphere may be used; for though its focus for parallel rays falls within the sphere when the refractions are made from air and into air, yet when the first refraction is made from a suitable fluid, the focus will fall without the sphere.

When the object is put into the best possible condition for observation, and the illuminator applied in the best possible manner, the observer will have every advantage in his researches; but still the structure which he seeks to dcvelope may escape his eager research. Under these circumstances, he must perform his part of the observation in the best possible manner.

Unless particular arrangements are made by the observer for his own comfort, there is no bodily fatigue to be compared with that of the use of the microscope. The eye, the mind, and the whole frame, are on the stretch. The observer must therefore first try if his own eye is in a right state for observation. The fluid which lubricates the cornea, which must be considered as a lens, and as part of the microscope, is sometimes in such a viscid state, that when the eyelids roll over the cornea by that beautiful provision of nature by which it is kept smooth and clean, the lubricating fluid, which is pushed into a ridge between the eyelids, does not quickly recover a convex surface. This state of the cornea is incompatible with delicate microscopic observations, and its existence may be ascertained by viewing the expanded image of a luminous point held close to the eye, and, after shutting the eyelids and again opening them slowly, observing if the luminous disc recovers its uniform luminosity quickly or slowly. If the luminous line produced by the fluid accumulated between the eyelids continues to be visible, and the general surface mottled and spotted, the lubricating secretion should be excited by exposing the eye to the vapour of hartshorn, raised by pouring a few drops on the surface of boiling water. The secretion will now flow copiously, the cornea will be swept clean by the purer and less viscid fluid, and the vision of the observer greatly improved. But this moveable fluid surface of the cornea generates another imperfection of vision, which has already been referred to. This fluid, when undisturbed by the eyelids, descends by the influence of gravity in vertical lines, and the minute ridges thus formed obliterate and render indistinct all horizontal lines seen by the eye, but have a tendency rather to improve the vision of vertical lines. In proof of this, we may state the unquestionable fact, that if we take a striped pattern of any fabric, and bend part of it into a horizontal direction, while the rest remains vertical, or vice versa, the vertical part will always appear the most distinct. Hence, in viewing lined objects, when the position of the observer’s head is either vertical or oblique, the lines of the lined object should be always placed parallel to the direction of the descending fluid. If the axis of the lenses is vertical, and the eye looks downwards, the lubricating fluid will collect irregularly at the apex of the cornea, and injure vision. If the axis of the lenses is horizontal, and the observer’s head in its natural position, the fluid will descend in vertical lines; but if the observer lies on his back and looks into the microscope upwards, a position, we admit, not favourable for research, the fluid will flow equally in all directions from the apex to the margin of the cornea, and leave a clear centre well fitted for distinct vision. We may here notice the beautiful contrivance, not mentioned by natural theologians, that the effect of vertical descent of the lubricating fluid is counteracted by the eyelids opening horizontally, and consequently effacing the tendency of the fluid to form vertical currents. Had the eyelids opened vertically, the vertical ridges would have been increased, and vision greatly impaired.

When every thing has been done to fit the cornea (the only part of the eye over which we have any direct command) for accurate vision, the general state of the health, or any casual irregularity of diet, will be sometimes found to affect the state of the organ, and unfit it for nice observation. To remedy'this defect of vision, we must refer the patient to the simplest prescriptions of his physician.

When these precautions have been taken, the observer must protect his eye from all extraneous light; and the most effectual way of doing this is to use the snow spectacles of the Greenlanders, which are cut out of wood so as to exclude all light whatever, except what enters through a circular aperture the size of the pupil, and directly in front of it.^[8. In the snow spectacles a long narrow slit is used to enable the wearer to look on each side of him. An interesting account of the great value of these spectacles, by the celebrated Professor Blumenbach, will be found in the Edinburgh Phil. Journal, vol. viii. p. 261.] A cast should be taken in plaster of Paris from the part of the face to which they are to be applied, to enable the artist to cut them of a proper shape; and when finished they should be lined with black velvet.

The last requisite for accurate microscopical observation is steadiness in the microscope, and a steady and comfortable position for the observer. The first is easily attained. The second may be accomplished by the observer resting his doubled arms upon a stool or frame nearly the height of the eye-glass of the microscope, but unconnected with it, while his chin rests either upon his arms or upon his breast.

When all these means and precautions fail in unravelling a mysterious structure, we have often derived advantage[7:15:54], in the case of lined objects, by looking through cylindrical lenses or good prisms; the length of the cylinder, or the refracting edge of the prism, being at right angles to the lines. Narrow slits may also be used with advantage next the eye; but in all these cases, while we improve and give a finer definition to the lines and the spaces between them, we deteriorate vision for other parts of the structure.

CHAP. VII. ON TEST OR PROOF OBJECTS FOR TRYING THE

PERFORMANCE OF MICROSCOPES.

This class of objects, and their application to the microscope, we owe to Dr Goring; and to their introduction we must ascribe much of the rapid improvement which this instrument has undergone. The finest test-objects are the scales of butterflies and moths, which were suggested to Dr Goring by the following passage in Leewenhoeck. “If we examine the wings of this creature (the silk-worm moth) by the microscope, we shall find them covered with an incredible number of feathers (scales), of such various forms, that if an hundred or more of them were to be seen lying together, each would appear of a different shape. To show more clearly this wonderful object, I caused eight feathers to be delineated, for I do not remember that I ever saw them of so curious a make in any flying insect.

“Although the microscope, by which these feathers were drawn, represented objects very distinctly, the limner could not through it see the ribs or streaks in each feather until I pointed them out to him ; therefore, I put into his hands a microscope which magnified objects almost as much as that by which the silk worm’s thread was drawn, desiring him to give the figure of that feather which through it he could see the most distinct.”^[9. Select Works, p. 63.]

From this passage, Dr Goring naturally inferred, that there were some peculiar properties in the lines on the feathers and scales of insects, which rendered them more difficult to be discovered than other microscopic objects; and hence he discovered their properties as test or proof objects for trying the penetrating powers of microscopes. Mr Pritchard regards the penetrating power of a microscope as dependent on its angle of aperture, and its defining power as in the inverse ratio of the quantity of chromatic and spherical aberration. When the angle of aperture was less than a certain quantity, he found that the lined structure of the scales could not be rendered visible, however perfect the instrument was. ’The following is his list of test objects, arranged in relation to penetrating and defining power* Several of these are represented in Plate CCCLXII.

2. Hair of the bat genus, fig. 16, 17. 3. Leaf of the moss Hypnum i species unknown.

4. Spotted scales of the Lycaenae Argus, fig. 24.

Besides these test objects, which are copied from Mr Pritchard’s drawings in the Microscopic Cabinet, we have added from the same source the following interesting objects:

1. A hair from the larva of the common Dermestes, fig. 18.

2. A white hair from a young cat, fig. 19.

3. The hair of á Siberian fox, fig. 20.

4. The hair of a common caterpillar, fig. 21.

5∙ A scale from the under side of the wing of the blue butterfly, the Lycaenae argus, fig. 22.

In some of the preceding figures of the lined proof objects the reader will perceive diagonal or oblique lines, as in fig. 9, 10, different from the longitudinal ones seen in fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. These lines are reckoned more difficult to be seen than the longitudinal ones; and Dr Goring has mentioned those on the scales of the white-cabbage butterfly as a difficult test object. Mr Potter, who has seen these diagonal lines, mentions also his having observed them on the scales of the wing of the small housemoth. As the nature of these oblique lines is far from being understood, and as their real existence is in our opinion questionable, we shall lay before our readers Mr Pritchard’s observations on those observed in the scales of the Podura plumbea and Pieris brassica.

“In the foregoing account,” says he, “of the different scales from the wings and bodies of insects, the design has been to give their appearances under microscopes or engiscopes without in the least determining their actual structure. When it is considered that these lines are less than the twenty thousandth of an inch distant, it must be allowed there is some difficulty in accurately determining their construction. The Morpho menelaus and Lepisma saccharina are of sufficient size to distinctly perceive they are composed of two delicate tissues with longitudinal cords (probably tabular) disposed between them; but in the two delicate ones, the subject of these remarks, we perceive other systems of }ines disposed obliquely; and as they are extremely delicate, it becomes à question whether they actually exist, or whether they are appearances produced under certain modifications of the illumination. As there is only one set shown at a time, and I have never been able to see them in the decided way of the longitudinal lines, I have been induced to consider them as appearances only, and not real lines. To determine this point, it became necessary to ascertain the cause that would produce such an effect; and it immediately occurred to me that these oblique lines were occasioned by the disposition and pressure of the superambient scales, in the same manner as the watering or wavy appearance communicated to-corded silks and moreens by the pressure of two pieces passed between rollers.^[10. I have since examined the Ρetrοlius Maritimus as an opaque object, which confirms this view of the nature of the oblique lines on its scales.] In examining the [7:15:55] scales of the Pieris brassica under a deep power and large angle of aperture, I found them broad in some parts and almost invisible in others; and the same appearance presented itself in the curved lines on the scale of the Podura plumbea, some idea of which may be obtained by examining figs. 9 and 10 of Plate CCCLXIL

“The motive that has induced me to offer the above remark is, that it may lead to a complete investigation of the subject. What is here given is merely the crude idea that presented itself in the course of their examination as proof-objects.”^[11. Microscopic Cabinet, p. ICO, 161.]

Dr Goring has published, in the Journal of the Royal Institution, vol. xxii. and also in the Micrographia, ^[12. Hall, 159, &c.] many interesting observations on lined objects, of which it is necessary to give some account. In order to explain the effects of aperture on lined objects, he has represented in the seven circles shown in fig. 23, Plate CCCLXII. the different appearances of a portion of the scale of the Mοr-plιο menelaus, shown in fig. 1, produced by increasing the aperture. He used a triple achromatic object-glass nine tenths of an inch focus, and half an inch in aperture, with a negative eye-piece of one fourth of an inch.

No. 1. shows the appearance of the scale when the aperture was one tenth of an inch, not a vestige of lines being visible.

No. 2. Aperture three twentieths; Dr Goring fancied he saw indications of lines or scratches.

No. 3. Aperture one fifth; traces of irregular scratches seen.

No. 4. Aperture three tenths; nascent lines recognised by a practised eye, like an aggregation of dots, but interrupted and broken.

No.5. Aperture four tenths; the lines resolved, but not fairly. They are very faint, and seem rugged, as if still composed of dots and points.

No. 6. Aperture five tenths; the full aperture of the lens. The lines appear in their true character, as if drawn by a pen with some blue pigment on light-violet coloured paper.

No. 7. Same aperture. When the object is turned one fourth round, the cross striae become perceptible.

Our limits will not permit us to give Dr Goring’s excellent observations on the lines of the Pοntia brassica, as seen also with apertures of different sizes in a reflecting microscope. With a well-figured metal, three tenths of an inch focus, and an angle of 55½ o aperture, the lines and cross striae he found never to be resolved into dots and points, but to appear in what he supposes to be their proper character. “The two sets of diagonal lines,” he remarks, “will be shown with a force and effect which will leave no doubt of their existence in the mind of a candid observer; the various lines, the longitudinal, the cross striae, and the two sets of diagonals, being all observable successively by a slight change of illumination, though we can scarcely see two of the systems well at the same instant.”^[13. λ Μicrogrαρhiα, p. 1G3.]

Dr Goring elsewhere observes,^[14. Micrographie, p. 130 and 144.] that the reflecting microscope invariably shows the diagonal lines on the brassica as distinct as the eye sees the ruled lines on a copy-book; that in some “pet scales” one of the systems of oblique lines may be seen by looking into the instrument directly, and the other by looking into it obliquely, without any alteration in the illumination; ^[15. Ibid. p. 102, note.] and that if one instrument shows the lines dotty, broken, interrupted, or ragged, while another shows them clearly made out as veritable lines or stripes drawn with a pen and ink, the latter is the best.^[16. Ibid. p. 104.]

Notwithstanding these repeated decisions of Dr Goring, he seems, in an earlier part of his volume,^[17. Micrographie!, p. 44.] to have had some misgivings on the subject. In speaking of the lined tests, he says, “There is an inexplicable mystery about them, for if their lines are in reality pι oduced on the same principle as those of micrometers, why are they not as easily seen ? No penetrating power or large angular aperture is requisite to bring out the lines on a micrometer, though divided nearly as finely as ordinary tests, to the extent perhaps of 10,000 in an inch.” These observations are just and philosophical, and we would add only a single observation in support of them, that Dr Wollaston made platina wires the 18,000th of an inch in diameter, and saw them distinctly; and we venture to say, that in no instrument whatever would such lines appear either dotted or ragged.

Such was the state of this subject when these lined objects were examined by Sir David Brewster, both in reference to their action upon light when examined by the naked eye, and when placed under the microscope as test objects. Having been occupied for several years in a series of analogous observations on the lines which apparently separate the component fibres of the crystalline lenses of animals, he was familiar with the class of optical illusions which interfere with the accurate development of such structures.

Upon exposing the finest lined objects to a bright light, and excluding as much as possible all other extraneous rays, he saw distinctly the fringes of colour produced by inte.rference; and on measuring the angular distances of the first red fringe from the light, he found that the distance of the lines, or rather the diameter of one black line and half the bright space between the lines, varied from the 10,000th to the 22,000th of an inch. Hence, if we take the black lines and their intervals to be equal, the diameter of each will vary from about the 13,000th to the 29,000th of an inch.

Although these apparent lines give colours by interference, exactly like the analogous lines in the laminae of the crystalline lens, yet neither of them are real lines, as decided upon by Dr Goring. With small apertures the lines in the crystalline lens appear dotty, interrupted, uneven, and ragged, and exhibit, in short, all the general phenomena of the lines on proof objects; but with a good microscope and ajarge aperture, we discover the true secret of all these appearances. They are not lines, but a succession of teeth arranged in lines; and from the great number of lines forming the sides of the teeth, they appear dark. Each fibre, in short, has teeth on each side of it,^[18. See Phil. Trans. 1830.] and the teeth of one fibre lock into the spaces between the teeth of the adjacent fibres. When we trace these fibres towards the pole to which they converge, they become smaller and smaller, the teeth diminishing in the same proportion, so that they become as difficult, and finally more difficult to resolve than the lines in the proof objects.

After a laborious examination of the lined tests, and the use of every optical resource which he could command, Sir David Brewster has found that the mysterious lines on these test objects are only apparent lines, being composed of a succession of interlocking teeth, by which the fibres to which they are attached form that delicate film which composes the scale of a moth. We now see the source of all the perplexities which have beset this class of observations. We understand why such lines are not seen so distinctly as the real lines on micrometers, and the dots and the raggedness are all explained. In the lenses of quadrupeds the teeth of the fibres are not round like those of fishes, but are often sharp pointed and extremely short, like a jagged line, or a line with [7:15:56] points projecting from it. In like manner, the separation of the teeth is much more distinct in some of the lined objects than in others. See fig. 24, in which we have given a rude representation of the lines.

With regard to the diagonal or oblique lines, which have been such a source of perplexity to microscopical observers, we have little hesitation in pronouncing those which we have seen to be optical illusions from the accidental alignement of the sides of the teeth in different grooves, when similarly illuminated by oblique rays. When the scales are immersed in diluted sulphuric acid, we have never seen the diagonal lines. When the sulphuric acid is too strong, the scales curl up, and often in this state exhibit the lines very beautifully. We have observed diagonal lines singularly developed in the laminae of the crystalline, and clearly arising from the interference of the rays acted upon by the lines on one side of the lamina, with the rays acted upon by the lines on the other side, and therefore we have been the more confirmed in our opinion. As we have not had the advantage, however, of using any of the fine reflecting microscopes with which Dr Goring observed the oblique lines so distinctly brought out, it is still with considerable diffidence that we place our conclusions in opposition to so direct and distinct an observation, made by such skilful and experienced observers as he and Mr Pritchard.^[19. Mr Pritchard informs us that the diagonal lines or cross striae are most easily seen in the scales from the wing of the Euplceα limniacoe, and in the blue scales from the Papiliο Paris, where they “are strongly and easily developed under a power of from 100 to 200 times.” In speaking of the ordinary lines, Mr Pritchard remarks, that these lines or “markings,” with his best instruments, “appear detached like short hairs or spines covering the delicate tissue of the scale. This latter appearance is correct, the prominent portions of the lines which have escaped the pressure of those of the surrounding scales being in a plane above the other portions of the lines.” This opinion of the structure of the lines, published in 1835, is not repeated in the Micrographia, published in 1837, where Dr Goring decides that they are real lines. See List o∕ ’ 2000 Microscopic Objects, p. 10. Lond. 1835.]

With the view of arriving at a just decision respecting the nature of the lines, Sir David Brewster endeavoured to ascertain the disposition of the colouring matter on the scales. Owing to the great brightness of the lines on the black scales, especially near their root, he was at first disposed to infer that, at least in these scales, the colouring matter was arranged along the black lines, the particles being more readily detained in their places by the edges of the teeth. He has found, however, that in other scales the colouring matter lies also along the bright lines; and it is only when this colouring matter is removed, or its effect masqued, by removing the refraction at its surface by immersion in a fluid, that the lines of proof objects are developed with perfect distinctness.

Sir David Brewster has made an attempt to count the number of scales and teeth in the wing of a brown moth, or in one superficial inch, the area of the two surfaces of each wing. He supposes, of course, all the scales to be the same in size and structure, and he finds that there are

Scales 158,400

Teeth 19,800,000,000

or nineteen thousand eight hundred million.

CHAP. Vlll.—ON MICROSCOPIC OBJECTS.

In the preceding chapter we have already described some of the most interesting objects for microscopical observation. Every department of nature is full of objects, from the examination of which the most important discoveries may be expected; bnt though the zealous observer can never be at any loss for subjects of research, it is desirable to know what has been done by our predecessors, and what trains of inquiry are most likely to prove of general interest. There are subjects of microscopic inquiry which are closely connected with the most interesting parts of physiology; and even geology itself, conversant with the grandest subjects of research, has recently been illustrated by the aid of the microscope.

Μ. Ehrenberg, to whom we are indebted for so many important discoveries respecting the organisation of infusorial animalcules, has lately made the most remarkable discovery of infusorial organic remains. These remains are the siliceous shells of animalcules belonging to the division Bacillaria, and form strata of Tripoli, or poli-schiefer (polishing-slate), at Franzenbad, in Bohemia.^[20. - Poggendorff ’ s Annalen der Physik, 1836, No. V. p. 225.] Μ. Ehrenberg has still more recently discovered them in the semiopal found along with the polishing-slate in the tertiary strata of Bilin, in the chalk flints, and even in the semiopal or noble opal of the porphyritic rocks.^[21. Ibid. No. VI. p. 464.] The size of a single individual of these animals is about -<j⅛th of a line, or y¾⅜¾ th of an inch. In the polishing-slate from Bilin, in which there appear to be no vacuities, a cubic line contains, in round numbers, 23 millions of these animals, and a cubic inch contains 41,000 millions of them!

The weight of a cubic inch of the polishing-slate is 270 grains. There are, therefore, 187 millions of these animals in a single grain, or the siliceous coat of one of these animals weighs the 187 millionth part of a grain!

In Plate CCCLXII. figs. 24 and 25, we have given representations of these singular microscopic objects, as seen by Ehrenberg.

Another example of the value of microscopical observations may be drawn from the discovery of the teeth of the fibres, which compose the crystalline lenses of almost all animals. The crystalline lens is composed of innumerable fibres of nearly the same length, each of which tapers from its middle to its two extremities, where it comes to the sharpest point. The sides of each of these fibres are furnished with teeth like those of a watch-wheel, and the teeth of the one lock into those of the adjacent ones, as shown in fig. 28, Plate CCCLXH. When the power is small, or the microscope not good, or the laminae too thick and not nicely detached, each row of interlocking teeth appears as a dark line, sometimes as sharp as a black line drawn upon paper with a pen. Sometimes the lines appear rough and ragged, and as the fibres become less and less in approaching the poles, the black lines are as difficult to resolve into teeth as the lines on test-objects already described. The following measures, taken by Sir David Brewster, will show what a wonderful structure in the eye has been thus disclosed to us by the microscope. The calculations refer to the lens∙of a cod, four tenths of an inch in diameter.

Number of fibres in each lamina or spherical coat....2,500

Number of teeth in each fibre 12,500

Number of teeth in each spherical coat 31,250,000

Number of fibres in the whole lens 5,000,000

Number of teeth in the lens' 62,500,000,000

or the lens of a cod contains five millions of fibres, and sixty-two thousand five hundred millions of teeth; and if we reckon the curved end of the tooth as one surface, each tooth will have six surfaces,^[22. This includes the concave surface between two adjacent teeth.] which come into contact with the corresponding surfaces of the adjacent tooth, so that the number of touching surfaces will be three hundred and seventy five thousand millions; ^[23. ŭ Philosophical Transactions, 1833, p. 329.] “and yet this little sphere of tender jelly is as transparent as a drop of the purest water, and allows a beam of light to pass across these almost[7:15:57] innumerable joints without obstructing or reflecting a single ray !”

There is another class of objects of extreme interest, which Mr Pritchard has omitted to notice, and the development of which called forth all the resources of optical knowledge and practical experience with the microscope. These objects are the microscopic cavities in minerals, containing two fluids unknown to the chemist, groups of crystals, floating balls, and exhibiting actual chemical operations going on in these minute laboratories when exposed to changes of temperature. These various phenomena have been described and represented in drawings, in two papers by Sir David Brewster, published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In some of the precious stones, particularly in diamond, garnet, &c. these cavities are perfect spheres; but, owing to the great refractive power of the gem, they appear completely black and opaque, though the microscope descries a small spot of light in their centre, which is the pencil of light which they refract. These spherical cavities, and this central spot, are the finest objects for examining the aberration of lenses and specula, and are infinitely preferable to the reflected patches of light from small spherules of quicksilver. Dr Goring has observed spherical cavities or air-bubbles in fluids, and, with his usual ingenuity, recognised their utility for indicating the effects of aberration. Those which we have used in the gems are, however, permanent instruments of much greater utility, not only from our being able to use the same bright spot with all instruments and on all occasions, but from the dark ring round the bright spot being incomparably greater in the gems than in fluids.^[24. The ratio between the diameter of the dark sphere and of the small luminous spot gives a measure of the refractive power of the solid or fluid.] Representations of some of the cavities in fluids are given in Plate CCCLXIL fig. 29, 30, 31. Fig. 29 shows the cavities containing the two new fluids, which will not mix, though in the same cavity. The little circle is the bubble either of gas or of vacuity. The fluid round it is a highly evaporable fluid, and the fluid in the angles and ends of long cavities is a thick and unevaporable fluid, which indurates when exposed to the air. Figs. 29 and 30 are beautifully formed cavities in topaz.

Our limits will not permit us to pursue this subject farther, and we shall conclude the article with a very brief selection of microscopic objects from Mr Pritchard’s admirable little pamphlet, entitled a List of 2000 Microscopic Objects.
