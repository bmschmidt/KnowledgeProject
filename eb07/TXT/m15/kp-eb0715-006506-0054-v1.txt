MILETO, a city, the Miletus of antiquity, of the kingdom Î±f Naples, in the province of Calabria Ulteriore. It stands on elevated ground, but is watered by three small streams. It is the seat of a bishop. By the earthquake in 1783, the castle, the cathedral, a parish church, two monasteries, and many dwellings, were thrown down, and 1700 lives were lost. It has been in some degree rebuilt since.
