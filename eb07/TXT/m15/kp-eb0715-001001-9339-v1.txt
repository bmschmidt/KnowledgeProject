MICONE, an island of the Archipelago, in the Turkish province of Andros, which, with the small islands which surround it, contains forty-six square miles, and about 6000 inhabitants, living in one town of the same name, and in many detached rural hamlets. Although the soil is not good, and there is a scarcity of water, yet much wine and some corn, besides olives and figs, are produced. A great number of seamen are educated in the island. There are very few Turks, except the officers of government. Long. 25. 59. E. Lat. 37. 30. N.
