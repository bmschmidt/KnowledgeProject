MONTACUTE, a small town of Somersetshire, in the hundred of Tintinhull, 123 miles from London. It has near it a singular mound or sharp hill, covering twenty acres at the base, on which a castle was built by Moreton, brother of William the Conqueror, who named it from his friend Drogo de Montacute. It was afterwards converted into a monastery and a borough. The inhabitants, who are chiefly occupied in making gloves and sail-cloth, amounted in 1801 to 827, in 1811 to 857, in 1821 to 973 and in 1831 to 1028.
