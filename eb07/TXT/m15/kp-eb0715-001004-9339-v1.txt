MICROMETER.

Micrometer, from μικοος, small, and μετξον, a measure, is the name of an instrument generally applied to telescopes and microscopes, for measuring small angular distances within the field of the former, or the size of small objects within that of the latter.

Previously to the invention of the telescope, astronomers experienced great difficulty in measuring small angles in the heavens; but we may safely infer from the observations of Hipparchus, that he had succeeded, either by the actual division of his instruments, or by estimation, in determining celestial arcs to one third of a degree.

When the telescope was applied by Galileo, and our countryman Harriot, to the examination of the solar spots, it does not appear that they executed their drawings from any other than estimated measures. This indeed seems quite certain in the case of Harriot, whose original sketches we have had an opportunity of inspecting. The elaborate solar observations of Scheiner made in 1611, with a telescope on a polar axis, and published in 1630 in his Posa Ursina, though minutely laid down, and performed with great care, were certainly made without any instrument for subdividing the field of view.

As telescopic observations, however, multiplied, astronomers felt the necessity of having something more accurate than their eye for ascertaining minute distances in the heavens; and there can be no doubt that a micrometer was invented by our countryman Mr Gascoigne, previous to 1640, not long after the publication of the Posa Ursina. According to the description of it which he addressed in a letter to Mr Oughtred, and to the account of one of Gascoigne’s own instruments which Dr Hooke examined, its construction is as follows :—A small cylinder, stretching across the eye-tube of the telescope, is cut into a fine screw throughout one third of its length, the other two thirds being formed into a coarser screw, with threads at twice the distance. This compound screw is confined at both ends to its place, the fine part of it passing through a female screw in one bar, and the coarse part through a female screw in another bar, these two bars being grooved into each other, as in a sliding rule. Hence, if a nicely ground edge is fixed to one bar, and another to the other bar, so that these edges are accurately parallel, a motion of the screw round its axis will separate these two edges, andeach edge will move with a different velocity. The parts of a revolution are measured by an index and divided face, at the coarse end of the screw, while the number of whole revolutions is measured by a graduated bar moved by the coarse screw. The fine screw serves the purpose of keeping the middle part of this variable field (or the opening between the edges) in the axis or line of collimation of the telescope; for while the coarse screw moves the edge which it carries from the other edge considered as fixed, the fine screw moves both the edges, and indeed the whole frame, in an opposite direction, with one half of the velocity, an effect which is produced by fixing its bar to the tube of the telescope.^[1. See Phil. Trans. No. 29, p. 540, Nov. 1667 » Lowthorp’s Abridgment, vol. i. p. 22G; and Costard’s History of Astronomy.] As Mr Gascoigne fell in the civil wars, near York, in 1644, before he had given any full account of his invention, and its application to astronomy[7:15:11], we are indebted to Mr Richard Townley, into whose hands one of the instruments fell, for the preservation of so valuable a relic. Mr Townley informs us that Mr Gascoigne had made use of his micrometer for some years before the civil wars, and had measured distances on the earth, determined the diameters of the planets, and endeavoured to find the moon’s distance from two observations of her horizontal and meridional diameters. Mr Townley’s instrument was of the size and weight of “an ordinary pocket watch.” It marked 40,000 divisions in a foot, 2½ divisions corresponding to a second of space. Mr Townley had it improved by a common watchmaker. Flamsteed was presented with one of the instruments in 1670, by Sir Jonas Moore; but though he left three guineas with Mr Collins to get proper glasses made for it, he could not procure them till autumn 1671, when he began his observations with it at Derby, and continued them with it in 1671, 1672, 16/3, and 1674.^[2. See Mr Baily’s Account of the Reverend John Flamsteed, 1835, p. 24, 29, &c.] He informs us that Townley’s improvement consisted in substituting one screw for two. He mentions also that Gascoigne had, in August 1640, measured with his micrometer the diameters of the sun and moon, and the relative distances of the stars in the Pleiades.

Dr Hooke made an important improvement in this micrometer, by substituting parallel hairs for the parallel edges of the brass plates;^[3. Hooke’s Posthumous Works, p. 497-8.] and Dr Pearson conjectures that he had adopted this construction in his zenith sector, by which he proposed, in his dispute with Hevclius, to measure single seconds.

It would appear, from the Ephemerides of the Marquis of Malvasia, published in the year 1662, that he had measured the distances of stars, and the diameters of the planets, and projected the lunar spots, by means of a reticle of silver wire fixed in the focus of the eye-glass of his telescope. In order to determine the distances of the wires which composed this network, he turned it round till a star moved along one of the wires, and having counted the number of seconds which the star took to pass over the different distances between the wires, he obtained a very accurate scale for all micrometrical purposes.

About the year 1666, MM. Auzout and Picard, unacquainted with what had been done by Gascoigne, published an account of a micrometer.^[4. Phil. Trans. No. 21, p. 373, January 1G6G.] Auzout’s micrometer is said to have divided a foot into 24,000 or 30,000 parts. It resembled the Marquis of Malvasia’s, with this difference, that the divisions were measured by a screw, and he sometimes employed fibres of silk in place of silver wires.

The celebrated Christian Huygens was also an early inventor of micrometrical methods; and the subject was prosecuted with great diligence and success by Cassini, Roemer, Bradley, Savary, Bouguer, Dollond, Maskelyne, Ramsden, Sir W. Herschel, Troughton, Wollaston, Arago, Fraunhofer, and Amici.

CHAP. I DESCRIPTION OF WIRE-MICROMETERS IN WHICH

THE WIRES ARE MOVED BY MEANS OF ONE OR MORE SCREWS.

The micrometer of Gascoigne, when furnished with hairs, as suggested by Dr Hooke, embodies the principle of the best and most recent micrometers. Instruments on this construction have been made by all our eminent opticians; but we have no hesitation in saying, that the micrometer constructed by the late celebrated artist Mr Troughton combines all the ingenuity which has been displayed in this delicate and useful apparatus. This eye-piece, and micrometer attached to it,are shown inPlate CCCLVII. fig. 1, 2, and 3, where fig. 1 is a horizontal section in the direction of the axis of the telescope. The eye-piece AB consists of two plano-convex lenses A, B, of nearly the same focal length, and the two convex sides facing each other. They are placed at a distance less than the focal length of A, so that the wires of the micrometer, which must be distinctly seen, are beyond B. This arrangement gives a flat field, and prevents any distortion of the object. This eye-piece slides into the tube CD, which screws into the brass ring EF, through two openings, in which the oblong frame MW passes. A brass circle GIT, fixed to the telescope by the screw I, has rack-teeth on its circumference, that receive the teeth of an endless screw W, which, being fixed by the arms XX to the oblong box MN, gives the latter and the eye-piece a motion of rotation round the axis of the telescope; and an index upon this box points out on the graduated circle upon GH, fig. 3, the angular motion of the eye-piece. The micrometer properly so called is shown in fig. 2, where K, L arc two forks, each connected with a screw 0 and P, turned by the milled heads Μ and N. These forks are so fitted as to have no lateral shake. Two pins Q, R, with spiral springs coiled round them, pass loosely through holes in the forks K, L, so that when the forks are pressed by their screws towards Q,and R, the spiral springs resist them, and consequently push them back when the screws are turned in the opposite direction.

Two fine hairs, or wires, or spiders’ lines, S, T, are stretched across the forks, the one being fixed to the inner fork K, and the other to the outer fork L, so as to be perfectly parallel, and not to come in contact when they pass or eclipse one another, in which case they will appear as one line. A wire ST is stretched across the centre of the field, perpendicular to the parallel wires.

The most difficult part of this instrument in the execution, as well as the most important, is the screw or screws which move the forks. The threads must not only be at the same distance, but have their inclination equal all round. In the screw used tíy Troughton, there are about 103∙6 threads in an inch. On the right hand of the line ST, fig. 2, is seen a scale, which indicates a complete revolution of either screw, the small round hole being the zero. This hole is bisected when the two lines appear as one.

In using this instrument, we separate the wires by their respective screws, till the object to be measured is exactly [7:15:12] included between them. The number of revolutions and parts of a revolution necessary to bring the two wires into the position of zero, will then be a measure of the angle required, provided the value of a revolution has been previously ascertained with accuracy.

The easiest method of ascertaining the value of a revolution of-the screw, according to the late Dr Pearson, who devoted much attention to this subject, is to ascertain how many revolutions and parts of one measure exactly the sun’s vertical diameter in summer, when his altitude is such that the refraction of both limbs is almost the same. The sun’s diameter in seconds being divided by that number, the quotient will be the value of a single revolution, the sun’s diameter having been corrected by the difference between the refraction of his two limbs. The ordinary method of ascertaining the value of a revolution is, to observe accurately the time taken by an equatorial star, or a star of known declination reduced to the equator, to pass over the space between the wires when at a distance, and to convert this time into degrees, at the rate of 15° per hour. The number of degrees, minutes, and seconds, divided by the revolutions and parts of a revolution which are necessary to bring both wires into zero, will give the value of one revolution of the screw. The same thing may be done by measuring a base with great accuracy, and observing the space comprehended between the wires at that distance. The angular magnitude of this space, divided by the number of revolutions of the screws which bring the wires to zero, will be the value of each.

A most elegant and accurate method has been recently employed, we believe by Professor Gauss of Göttingen, for measuring the value of the revolutions of micrometer screws. He employs for this purpose a standard telescope, with a micrometer the value of whose scale has been accurately determined. Since the wires of a telescope-micrometer adjusted to distinct vision of the stars or planets are accurately in the focus of parallel rays falling on the. object-glass, it follows, that rays issuing from the wires and falling on the inside of the object-glass, will emerge from it perfectly parallel. Now, if we place the object-glass of the standard telescope close or near to that of the first telescope, the parallel rays formed by those issuing from its wires will be refracted to the focus of the standard telescope, and a distinct image of the wires will be there formed. The observer, therefore, when he looks into the standard telescope, will see distinctly the wires of the first telescope, and, by means of his micrometer, he will be able to measure exactly the angular distance of these wires, at whatever distance they happen to be placed. This angular distance divided by the revolutions and parts of a revolution which are necessary to bring the wires of the first telescope to the zero of their scale, will give the value of one revolution of the screw, or of one unit of the scale on the right hand of the long wire ST, fig. 2.

The most essential parts of a micrometer are the parallel fibres, which require not only to be extremely fine, but of an uniform diameter throughout. Gascoigne, as we have seen, employed the edges of brass plates, Dr Hooke hairs, and subsequent astronomers wires and fibres of silk. Fontana, in 1775, recommended the spider’s line as a substitute for wires, and he is said (we think erroneously) to have obtained them so fine as the 8000th part of a line. Mr Troughton had the merit of introducing the spider’s line, which he found to be so fine, opaque, and elastic, as to answer all the purposes of practical astronomy. This distinguished artist, however, informed the writer of this article, that it was only the stretcher, or the long line which sustains the web, which possesses these useful properties. Sir David Brewster has employed the fibres of spun glass, which are bisected longitudinally with a fine transparent line about the 5∙^ 1 00th of an inch in diameter. This central line increases with the diameter of the fibre, and diminishes with the refractive power of the glass. In cases of emergency, the fibres of melted sealing-wax may be advantageously employed, or, as recommended by Professor Wallace, the fibres of asbestos. We have found crystals of mesolite so minute and regular as to be well adapted for the same purpose.

The art of forming silver wire of extreme minuteness has been perfected by Dr Wollaston. Having placed a small platinum wire in the axis of a cylindrical mould, he poured melted silver into the mould, so that the platinum wire formed the axis of the silver cylinder. The silver was now drawn out in the usual way, till its diameter was about the 300th of an inch, so that if the platinum wire was at first τ 1 θth of the diameter of the silver cylinder, it will now be reduced to the 3000th part of an inch. The silver wire is now bent into the form of the letter U, and a hook being made at each of its ends, it is suspended by a gold wire in hot nitric acid. The silver is speedily dissolved by the acid, excepting at its ends, and the fine platinum wire which formed its axis remains untouched. In this way Dr Wollaston succeeded in forming wire ∙¾(⅛yth, i⅛⅛0. t ^> an d even τ7 ⅛Λ- 0 th of an inch in diameter. When the fibres are prepared, their ends are placed in parallel scratches or grooves drawn on the forks, or, in other cases, on the diaphragm or field bar, and fixed by a layer of bees’ wax or varnish, or, what is more secure, by pinching them with a small screw-nail near their extremities. For a great deal of valuable practical information respecting the construction and use of the wire-micrometer, the reader is referred to the late Dr Pearson’s Introduction to Practical Astronomy (vol. ii. p. 99, 110, 115, &c.), where valuable tables will be found for facilitating the application of the micrometer, both to celestial and terrestrial purposes. See also Sir John Herschel and Sir James South’s Observations of 380 Double and Triple Stars(p. 22, 23), containing tables of the values of Troughton’s screws.

CHAP. II. DESCRIPTION OF WIRE-MICROMETERS IN WHICH THE ANGULAR DISTANCE OF THE WIRES IS VARIED OPTICALLY BY CHANGING THE MAGNIFYING POWER OF THE TELESCOPE.

MM . Roemer and De la Hire first conceived the idea of varying the angular magnitude of the meshes of a net of silver wire fixed in the focus of the eye-glass of a telescope, for the purpose of measuring the digits of eclipses. This was done by a second lens moving between the wires and the object-glass. The late Mr Watt informed the writer of this article that he had used a similar principle, but bad never published any account of it.

The plan of opening and shutting a pair of parallel wires optically instead of mechanically, and of using it as a general principle in micrometers, was first adopted by Sir David Brewster, and has been applied to a variety of methods of varying the magnifying power of the telescope.

The general principle will be readily understood from the annexed diagram, where AB, CD are two wires or lines of any kind permanently fixed in the focus of the eye-glass of a telescope. If the sun S'√ is in contact with the lower wire CD, it is obvious, that if we increase the magnifying power of the telescope by any optical means anterior to the wires, we may magnify or expand the sun’s disc S⅛ ’, till it becomes Ss, when its north or upper limb will exactly touch the upper wire AB. Now if the sun’s diameter happens to be 31'
[7:15:13]

when its disc Ss just fills the space between the wires -AB, CD, the distance of the wires must have been 62' when, as at S's', it fills only half that space. Hence the wires have been moved optically, so to speak, and have subtended all angles between 31' and 62'.

The methods of varying the magnifying power of the telescope used by Sir David Brewster, consist, 1, in varying the distance of the two parts of the achromatic eyepiece; and, 2, by varying the focal length of the principal object-glass by means of another object-glass, either convex or concave, moving between it and its principal focus.

The first of these methods is shown in fig. 2, where AB is the eye-piece with its four lenses, A, C, D, B, in their natural position. The part AFG, with the two lenses A, C, is fixed to the telescope, and a space is left between the tube AC and the outer tube AFG, to allow the moveable part DB of the eye-piece to get sufficiently near the lens C. The tube DB is moved out and in by a rack and pinion E. A scale is formed on the upper surface mn, and subdivided in the usual manner with a lens and vernier, which it is unnecessary to represent in the figure. The value of the divisions of the scale are determined by.direct experiment. A motion of DB through a space of four inches will, generally speaking, double the magnifying, power of the telescope.

The best method, however, of varying the magnifying power of the telescope is the second, η+ich is shown in fig. 3, where 0 is the object-glass,∕*its principal focus, and

L the second lens, which is moveable between 0 and f Parallel rays RR, after being refracted by 0, so that they would converge to f, are intercepted by L, which converges them to F, the focus of the combined lenses. The effect of the lens L is therefore to diminish the focal length of the object-glass, and consequently the magnifying power of the telescope, which will obviously be a minimum when the lens L is at l, and a maximum when it is at l'. The angle subtended by a pair of fixed wires will suffer an opposite change to the magnifying power, being a maximum when the lens L is at Z, and a minimum when it is at- l'. Hence the scale for measuring the variable angle of these wires may always be equal to the focal length of the object-glass 0; and the inventor of the instrument has shown, both by theory and by experiment, that the scale is one of equal parts, the variations in the angle of the fixed wires being proportional to the variations in the position of the moveable lens.

When we wish to measure angles that do not suffer a great change, such as the diameters of the sun and moon, a scale less than the focal length of the object-glass will be sufficient. For example, if we take a lens L, which by a motion of ten inches varies the magnifying power from 40 to 35, then, if the angle of the wires is 29' when the lens L is at l', it will be 33' 9" when the lens is ten inches from l', or the magnifying power 35. We have, therefore, a scale of ten inches to measure a change of angle of 4l 9*, so that every tenth of an inch will correspond to 3"∙3, and every 100th of an inch to ⅜d of a second. Such a micrometer will serve to measure the diameters of the sun and moon at their various distances from the earth.

If we wish to measure the distances of some double stars, or the diameters of some of the smaller planets, with a telescope whose magnifying power varies from 300 to 240, by the motion of a lens over ten inches, place the parallel wires at a distance of 40", which will be increased to 50" by the motion of the lens. Hence we have a scale of ten inches to measure ten seconds, or the tenth of an inch to measure one second, or the 100th of*hn inch to measure ∙⅛th of a second.

Several pairs of wires placed at different distances might be fixed upon the same diaphragm, or upon separate diaphragms, which could be brought into the focus when wanted; and the second pair of wires might be placed at such a distance that their least angle was equal to the largest angle of the first pair, and so on with the rest.

A wire-micrometer thus constructed is certainly free from almost all the sources of error which affect the common moveable wire-micrometer. The errors arising from the imperfection of the screw, the uncertainty of zero, and other causes, are avoided; and the wires are always equidistant from the centre of the field, so as to be equally affected by any optical imperfection in the telescope. The scale indeed may be formed by direct experiment, and the results will be as free from error as the experiments by which the scale was made.

When this micrometer is applied to a portable telescope, it becomes of great use in naval, military, or geodetical operations, and is employed in measuring distances, either by taking the angle subtended by a body of known dimensions, or by measuring the two angles subtended by a body of unknown dimensions from the two extremities of a known or measured base. For these purposes the telescope is fitted up without a stand, as shown in Plate CCCLVII. fig. 4.

The principle of separating a pair of wires optically is singularly applicable to the Gregorian and Cassegrainian telescopes, where no additional lens or mirror is required. As the magnifying power of both these telescopes maybe increased merely by increasing the distance of the eyepiece from the great speculum, and then re-adjusting the small speculum to distinct vision, we can thus vary the angle of a pair of fixed wires by making the eye-piece moveable. This will be easily comprehended from the annexed figure, where SS is the great speculum of a Gregorian reflector, AA the tube, Μ the small speculum, whose focus is G, and centre of curvature H. It is fixed to an arm MQ, moveable to and from SS in the usual way. The image R'r' is that formed by the speculum SS, and r"R* that formed by the small speculum. This last image being in the focus of the eye-glass E, will be seen distinct and magnified. If the eye-glass E is pulled out to E', then, in order that the object may be seen distinctly, the image r*BΛ must be brought into the position r* ’ R'", FF' being equal to EE'; but this can be done only by advancing the small speculum Μ to M',∕and F' being now the conjugate [7:15:14] foci of Μ. But by this process the magnifying power has been considerably increased, because the part of the whole MF magnifying power produced by Μ was equal to whcre-M'F' . ιv V

as it is now a much larger quantity. The angle subtended by the wires has therefore been diminished in the same proportion as the magnifying power has been increased. The scale, in this case, is not one of equal parts, but after the extreme points of it have been determined experimentally, the rest may be filled up either by calculation or direct experiment.

Dr Pearson^[5. Introduction to Practical Astronomy, vol. ii.] has, with singular inaccuracy, stated that Sir David Brewster’s “patent micrometer is not competent to measure very small angles, even if it had sufficient magnifying power.” If he means the patent micrometer as made by Mr Harris, as a naval and military telescope for measuring distances, or as a coming-up glass, he is quite right, because the power of measuring small angles is not required for these practical purposes. But it is quite evident that the smallest angles can be measured by the micrometer when fitted up for astronomical purposes. We have only to use a pair of wires placed at a very small distance, or a pair of semi-lenses whose centres are placed at a very small distance, and then vary their angles till it becomes equal to the very small angle which we wish to measure.

CHAP. III. DESCRIPTION OF DOUBLE-IMAGE MICROMETERS IN WHICH TWO SINGLY REFRACTING LENSES, SEMI-LENSES, OR PRISMS, ARE SEPARATED BY SCREWS.

Μ. Roemer, the celebrated Danish astronomer, is said to have been the first who suggested the use of a doubleimage micrometer. He did this about 1678, but the idea does not seem to have been carried into effect, or known to bis successors. Nearly seventy years afterwards, viz. in 1743, Mr Servington Savary, of Exeter, communicated to the Royal Society an account of a double-image micrometer; and five years afterwards, in 1748, the celebrated Bouguer proposed the very same construction, which he called a heliometer. This instrument consisted of two’ lenses, which could be separated and made to approach each other by a screw or other mechanical means. These lenses gave double images of every object; and when the two images of any object, such as the sun or moon, were separated till they exactly touched one another, the distance of the object-glasses afforded a measure of the solar or lunar diameter, after an experimental value of the divisions of the scale had been obtained.

As two complete lenses, however, must always have their least distance equal to the diameter of either, this instrument was incapable of measuring the diameters of small bodies. This obvious defect no doubt led John Dollond, in 1753, to the happy idea of the divided object-glass micrometer, in which the two halves of an object-glass are made to recede from the position in which they form a complete object-glass. When the centres of the two halves coincide, they obviously form one lens, and give only one image. When the centres arc slightly separated the images will be slightly separated; and small objects may be brought into contact, and have the angles which they subtend accurately measured. The scale will, therefore, have a zero corresponding to the coincidence of the centres of the semi-lenses. The principle of this instrument will be understood from fig. 5, where H, E are two semi-lenses, whose centres are at H, E, and F their focus. If PQ be a circular object whose diameter is to be measured, or P, Q two points whose angular distance is to be determined, the lenses arc to be separated till the two images x, z are in contact at F.

As the rays QHF, PEF pass unrefracted through the centres H, E of the semi-lenses, the angle subtended by QP will be equal to the angle HFE, or that which the distance of the centres of the semi-lenses subtends at F. As the angles, therefore, are very small, they"will vary as HE; and when the angles corresponding to any one distance of the centres is determined, those for any other distance will be ascertained by simple proportion.

Mr Dollond, who had not at this time invented the achromatic telescope, applied his micrometer to the object end of a reflecting telescope, as shown in Plate CCCLVIL fig. 5, which represents the micrometer as seen from beyond the object end of the reflector. A piece of tube B, carrying the micrometer, slides into or over the tube A of the telescope, and is fastened to it by a screw. The tube B carries a wheel (not seen in the figure) formed of a ring racked at the outer edge, and fixed*, td the brass plate CC, so that a pinion moved by the handle D may turn it into any position. Two plates F, G are kept close to the plate CC by the rabbeted bars H, H, but with so much play that they can move in contrary directions by turning the handle E, which drives a concealed pinion that works in the two racks seen in the highest part of the figure. As the two semi-lenses are fixed to the plates F, G, their centres will be separated by the action of the handle E, and their degree of separation is measured by a scale of five inches subdivided into 20ths of an inch, and read off by a vernier on the plate F, divided into 25 parts, corresponding to 24 of the scale, so that we can measure the separation of the semi-lenses to the y ½ π th an lnc ^∙ The vernier is seen to the right of H, and may be adjusted to the zero of the scale, or the position of the lenses when they give only one image, by means of the thumb-screw I, a motion of the vernier being permitted by the screws which fix it to the plate F passing through oblong holes.^[6. Phil. Trans. vol. xlviii.]

In this construction, the micrometer is too far from the observer, and destroys the equilibrium of the telescope. The instrument itself, however, has more serious defects, as it has been found that the measures of the sun’s diameter, taken by different observers, with the same instrument, and at the same time, differ so much as 12 or 15 seconds. This defect has been ascribed to the different states of the observers’ eyes, according as they have a tendency to give distinct vision within or beyond the focal point, where the image is most perfect; in the former case the limbs being somewhat separated, and in the latter overlapping. Μ. Mosotti, in the Effemeride of Milan for 1821, has discovered the true cause of this defect, by a scries of accurate experiments which he made with this micrometer attached to a Gregorian reflector of two feet in focal length. The focal length of the divided object-glass was 511∙3357 inches, or 42 feet 7½ inches. Μ. Mosotti has shown that a diversity of measures will be obtained by the same observer, if, for the purpose of obtaining distinct vision, he gives a slight displacement to the small speculum by the adjusting screw. If the position of this speculum which gives distinct vision were a point, it would be easy to find that point; but as distinct vision may be obtained within a [7:15:15] space of 10 or 12 thousandths of an ineh, owing to aberration, every different observer will place the mirror at a different point within that range, and consequently obtain a measure corresponding to the image which he views. Μ. Mosotti recommends that the axis of the adjusting screw, which carries the small speculum, should carry a vernier connected with a scale on the outer surface of the tube A. By means of this vernier the observer is able to give a fixed position to the small speculum, so that he always views the same image, and is thus sure of obtaining the same measure of the same object, so far as the observation is concerned. Μ. Mosotti found also that the measures were affected by a change of temperature, which, by changing the length of the tube, displaced the small speculum. In his instrument this displacement amounted to 0∙0075 of an inch, which, he has shown, corresponds to a change of foeal length from 5] 1∙3357 to 514∙84 inches; and that the error from this eause, upon a length of 30', will be 13" in exeess.

The following is Dr Pearson’s enumeration of the different sources of error in the divided objeet-glass micrometer when applied to reflectors.

1. A variation in the position of the small mirror when the eye estimates the point of distinct vision.

2. A displacement of the small mirror by change of temperature.

3. A change of foeal distance when central and extreme rays are indiscriminately used. The amount of this error depends on the aberration of the semi-lenses.

4. A defect of adjustment, or of perfect figure, in the two specula, as they regard each other, the measures varying when taken in different directions.

In order to enable Dollond’s micrometer to measure differences of declination and right ascension, Dr Maskelyne introduced the aid of cross wires, which he fixed in a moveable ring at the place where the double image is formed. One or both of the two planets or stars are referred to one or other of these lines, as will be seen in the annexed figure, which we take as an example, out of four cases. Let ENWS be the field of view, NS the meridian, and EW the line of east and west; then, in order to obtain the difference of right ascension and declination of two stars, he opened the semi-lenses till he obtained double images of each star. He then turned round the micrometer till the two images of the first star passed over the vertical wire NS at the same instant, and having counted the time that elapsed till the two images of the other star passed over the same line, he had the difference of right ascension in time. By means of the screw whieh elevated his telescope, and partly by opening the semi-lenses, he made the north image of one star, and the south image of the other, as at A, B, describe in their motion the horizontal wire EW, and at that position of the semi-lenses the scale indicated the difference of declination.

A very important improvement upon the divided objectglass micrometer ∖w as made by Mr Dollond’s son, who adapted it to a refracting telescope, and removed the different sources of error to which it had been found liable. This improvement consists both in the nature, form, and position of the semi-lenses. The semi-lenses are made eoncave, and consist of crown and flint glass, so as to give an achromatic image along with the object-glass of the tele scope to which they are applied. These concave semilenses, of course, lengthen the focal distance of that objectglass. When a circular lens was bisected, as in the old construction, the metallic parts whieh held the semi-lenses obstructed the light in proportion to their separation; a defect of a serious nature in an instrument. In order to correct this evil, Mr J. Dollond substituted two long slices of glass cut from the diametral portion of a lens nearly six inches in diameter. Hence, in every position of these oblong semi-lenses, none of the metallic setting eomes before the objeet-glass, and consequently the light is never obstructed, and is always of the same amount, whatever be the separation of the lenses. In the old construction, where the diameters of each lens slid along each other in contact, a part of the eentral portions having been removed by grinding the diameters smooth, the two images of an object never eould coincide so as to give an accurate zero ; but in the new construction, the space equal to what was removed by grinding is filled up with a brass scale and vernier, and the only evil of this is the loss of light corresponding to the thickness of this scale; but this trifling defect is amply compensated by the perfect coincidence of the images at zero.

This important instrument is shown in Plate CCCLVII. fig. 6, where the same letters are used as in fig. 5 to denote the analogous parts of the two instruments. The end of the telescope is shown at A, and B is the rim of brass, which, by sliding upon A, fixes the micrometer to the telescope. The frame CC', moved by teeth on its outer edge, carries one of the halves G of the lens, and a similar frame with teeth carries the other half F. The scale S, six inches long, is fastened like an edge-bar to CC', andeaeh inch is subdivided into 20 parts, which are read off with a vernier of 25 parts, which is fastened as an edge-bar to the moveable frame that carries F. The two moveable frames are imbedded in a fixed plate HH', screwed to the tube B of the-micrometer, and having a circular hole in its middle equal to the diameter of the object-glass. The two semi-lenses are separated by turning the milled head to the right of A, which moves the frame CC', and then the other frame F through the medium of a coneealed wheel and a concealed pinion. The mechanism for giving the rotatory motion is also concealed. The adjustment of the vernier to zero is effected by the screw I.

The property which the double-image micrometer possesses, of measuring angles in all directions, directed to it the attention of Ramsden and other eminent opticians. Ramsden accordingly communicated to the Royal Society of London, in 1777,^[7. See Phil. Trans, vol. Ixix. 1779, p. 419.] an account of two instruments of this kind, under the name of the Dioptric and Catoptric Micrometers. In order to avoid the effects of aberration, Ramsden proposed, in his dioptric micrometer, to place two semi-lenses in the conjugate focus of the innermost lens of the ereet eye-tube of a refracting telescope. In place of the imperfections of the lenses being magnified by the whole power of the telescope, they are magnified only about five or six times, and the size of the micrometer glass does not require to be T⅜o th part of the area which is necessary in Dollond’s instrument. This instrument is shown in Plate CCCLVIL fig. 7, where A is a convex or concave lens, bisected in the usual way. One of the semi-lenses is fixed in a frame B and the other in a similar frame E, both of which slide upon a plate H, against which they are pressed by thin plates α, a. The milled button D, by means of a pinion and raek, moves these frames in opposite directions; and the separation of the semi-lenses thus effected is measured by a scale of equal parts L on the frame B, the zero being in the middle, and the divisions read off by two verniers at Μ and N, carried by the frame E; the [7:15:16] vernier Μ showing the relative motion of the two frames when the frame B moves to the right, and N when the frame B is moved to the left. An endless screw F gives the whole micrometer a motion round the axis of vision. This instrument being only the divided object-glass micrometer in miniature, and differently placed, the reader will have no difficulty in understanding its construction and use, from the details already given in the preceding pages.

Dr Pearson informs us, on the authority of Mr Troughton, that a Captain Countess, R. N. having accidentally broken the third lens of a terrestrial eye-piece of his telescope, observed the double images which it produced; and that tlιis observation led to the contrivance of the coming-up glass that was first made by Nairne, with a double screw for separating the halves of the amplifying lens. Hence it is conjectured that Ramsden derived his idea of using a bisected lens for his dioptric micrometer and dynameter. The above facts may be quite true, but Ramsden certainly did not require any such hint, as it was a very natural transition from a bisected object-glass to a bisected eye-glass.

Dr Pearson also states that Mr George Dollond had constructed a dioptric micrometer almost the same as Ramsden’s, without knowing any thing of what Ramsden had proposed. We have no doubt that both these ingenious opticians were quite original in their ideas, for it will not be supposed that Captain Countess’s broken lens furnished Mr Dollond with the idea of his contrivance. Dr Pearson has given a drawing and description of Mr Dollond’s construction of the micrometer as made for Mr Davies Gilbert and himself.^[8. Introduction to Practical Astronomy, vol. ii. p. 182.] It does not appear that Mr Ramsden ever constructed it. The weight of this micrometer was found by Dr Pearson too great for an ordinary achromatic telescope.

Mr Ramsden likewise proposed a catoptric double-image micrometer,‘which, from being founded on the principle of reflection, is not disturbed by the heterogeneity of light, while he considered it as “avoiding every defect of other micrometers,” having “no aberration, nor any defect which arises from the imperfection of materials or of ^execution, as the extreme simplicity of its construction requires no additional mirrors or glasses to those required for the telescope.” “It has also, peculiar to itself, the advantages of an adjustment to make the images coincide in a direction perpendicular to that of their motion. In order to effect these objects, Mr Ramsden divided the small speculum of a Cassegrainian reflector into two equal halves, and by inclining each half on an axis at right angles to the plane that separated them, he obtained two distinct images; but as their angular separation was only half the inclination of the specula, which would give only a small scale, he rejected this first idea, and separated the semi-specula by making them turn on their centre of curvature, any extent of scale being obtained by fixing the centre of motion at a proportional distance from the common centre of curvature. The mechanism necessary to effect this is shown in Plate CCCLVII. fig. 8, where A is the bisected speculum, one of the semi-specula being fixed on the inner end of the arm B, its outer end being fixed on a steel axis X extending across the mouth of the tube C. The other semi-speculum is fixed on the inner end of the arm D, its outer end terminating in a socket y, which turns upon the steel axis x. These arms are braced by the bars a, a. . A compound screw G, having its upper part cut into double the number of threads in an inch, viz. 100, to the lower part g, which has only 50, works with the handle in a nut F in the side of the tube, while the part g turns in a nut H fixed to the arm B. The point of the compound screw separates the ends of the arms B and D, and, pressing against the stud h fixed to the arm D, turns in the nut H on the arm B. A spiral spring within the part η presses the two arms B, D against the direction of the double screw e g i so as to prevent all shake or play in the nut H. The progressive motion of the screw through the nut will be half the distance of the semi-specula, so that these specula will be moved equally in opposite directions from the axis of the telescope.

A graduated circle V, divided into 100 parts on its cylindrical surface, is fixed on the upper end of the screw G, so as to cause it to separate the semi-specula. The fixed index I shows the parts of a revolution performed by the screw, while the number of whole revolutions of the screw is shown by the divisions of the same index. A steel screw R, moveable by a key, inclines the small speculum at right angles to the direction of its motion. Distinct vision is procured in the usual manner, and the telescope has a motion about its axis, in order to measure the diameter of a planet in any direction; and the angle of rotation in reference to the horizon is shown by a level, graduated circle, and vernier, at the eye end of the large tube.

A catoptric double-image micrometer has been suggested by Sir David Brewster as applicable to the Newtonian telescope. The plane mirror is bisected, and is made to form two images, either by giving each semi-speculum a motion round .their common line of junction, or round a line perpendicular to that common line. The mechanism by which this may be effected does not require any description. If the micrometer is required for the sun or any luminous body, the small mirror may be made of parallel glass, which would have the advantage of not obstructing any of the light which enters the telescope, while it reflects enough for the purposes of distinct vision. We shall again have occasion to refer more particularly to this idea in the next section.

Professor Amici of Modena has described, in the Memoirs of the Italian Society, a new micrometer, which gives double images by means of semi-lenses separated by mechanical means; but as we have not access to this work, we shall draw our description of the instrument from one given by Dr Pearson, which is very far from being distinct, in so far at least as the construction of the semi-lenses, or bars of glass as they are called, are concerned. The semi-lenses seem to be portions of a large concave lens, separated in the usual manner, so as to give two distinct images of objects; but the peculiarity of the invention seems to consist in the lenses being placed between the object-glass of a telescope and its principal focus, the cone of rays being divided at a point about six inches before the place where the focal image is formed. Dr Pearson, who made experiments with one of these instruments, has hinted at the inconveniences which he experienced in using it.

CHAP. IV. DESCRIPTION OF DOUBLE-IMAGE MICROMETERS IN WHICH THE TWO IMAGES FORMED BY TW0 SIMPLY REFRACTING LENSES, SEMI-LENSES, OR PRISMS, ARE SEPARATED OPTICALLY.

In the year 1776 Dr Maskelyne constructed and used his prismatic micrometer, which he had contrived with the view of getting rid of the sources of error to which he found the divided object-glass micrometer liable. Having cut a prism or wedge of glass into two parts, so as to form two prisms of exactly the same refracting angle, he conceived the idea of fixing them together, so as to produce two images, and to vary the angle which these two images formed, by making the prisms move between the object[7:15:17]-glass and its principal focus; so that the scale is equal to the whole focal length of the telescope. The two prisms may be placed in three, ways, with their thin edges joined, with their square thick edges or backs joined, or with their sides or triangular edgés joined. In the first position the double images will have only one half of the light which is incident on the object-lens when the prisms are close to it, and their degree of illumination will diminish as they approach the focus. In the second position they will, as before, have only one half of the incident light when close to the object-glass, but the illumination will gradually increase as the prisms advance to the focus. In the third case, the prisms being in a reverse position, the light will be the same in every part of the scale, each of them receiving half the rays which fall upon the objectglass. On this account Dr Maskelyne preferred this last arrangement.

In the instrument which Dr Maskelyne constructed, and which seemed to have had only a thirty-inch objectglass, the prisms were not achromatic, and consequently the touching limbs of a luminous body were affected with the prismatic colours. In the case of the sun, where all the rays might have been absorbed but the red, this was of little consequence; but in other cases it was a serious defect, which could be removed only by making the prisms achromatic; or it might have been diminished by making the prisms of fluor spar, in which the dispersion is very small. One of the Dollonds, accordingly, executed for Dr Maskelyne an achromatic prism, which performed well. It does not appear that Dr Maskelyne made any observations of value with this instrument.

A new divided object-glass micrometer has been constructed by Sir David Brewster, and described in his Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments. It consists of an achromatic object-glass LL, fig. 7, between which and its principal focus/ two achromatic semi-lenses, fixed at a given distance, are made to move. These lenses are shown in fig. 8, and are fixed on a piece of tube, which screws into a tube; by pulling out and pushing in which, they are made to recede from or approach to the object-glass LL. By this motion the angle subtended by the two images varies in the same manner as the angle subtended by a pair of fixed wires was made to vary by the motion of a second object-glass. When the semilenses are close to LL, as shown at A, B, fig. 7, the two images which they form are much separated, and their centres subtend a large angle; but as the lenses approach to/ the centres of the images gradually approach each other, and consequently the angle which they subtend continually increases. Hence, if we determine by experiment the angular distance of their centres when the lenses are close to LL, and likewise the angle when they are at f the other end of the scale, and if we fill up the intermediate points of the scale either from theory or direct experiment, we shall have an instrument which will measure with the greatest accuracy all angles between the two extreme ones. Another or more pair of semi-lenses may be used in the same telescope, and placed at smaller or greater distances, so that, by means of other scales adapted to them, we may obtain all angles that may be required. The lenses A, B may be concave or convex; and when a large scale is required, with a tenth of an inch to a second, or even greater, we have only to use semi-lenses of long foci, and the scale may be confined to the part of the tube nearest the focal point.

Sir David Brewster has proved, both from theory and experiment, that the scale is one of equal parts; so that, after having ascertained by experiment the two extreme angles, the whole scales may be completed by dividing the interval into any number of equal parts, and these subdivided, if necessary, by a vernier scale.

When the semi-lenses are placed without the objectglass LL, and this object-glass moved towards f as in the annexed figure, the angular distance of the images is invariable.

This instrument has been constructed for measuring distances, and as a coming-up glass for ascertaining whether a ship is approaching to or receding from the observer. In this form it constitutes part of fig. 4, Plate CCCLVII., the semi-lenses being made to screw into the same place as the second object-glass, and having a separate scale for themselves. In this form many of the instruments have been constructed by Tulley.

Among the optical micrometers, we may describe another invented by Sir David Brewster, and adapted solely to the Newtonian telescope. In order to get rid of the loss of light by the reflection of the small plane speculum, he uses an achromatic prism to reflect the light just as much out of the axis of the telescope as will allow the bead of the observer to be applied to the eye-tube, without obstructing any of the light which enters the tube. By using two prisms, as in Maskelyne’s instrument, and moving them along the axis of his telescope through a small distance, we shall obtain a good micrometer. The prisms may be separated mechanically, or a doubly refracting prism may be fixed upon the face of the single or achromatic prism used to turn aside the rays. The achromatism of a single glass prism may be corrected by the doubly refracting prism, a balance of refraction being left sufficient to turn aside the image to the observers eye.

CHAP. V. DESCRIPTION OF DOUBLE-IMAGE MICROMETERS

IN WHICH THE TWO IMAGES ARE FORMED BY DOUBLE REFRACTION.

The happy idea of applying the two images formed by double refraction to the construction of a micrometer unquestionably belongs to the Abbé Rochon; and though Dr Pearson has laboured to show that Dr Maskelyne’s prismatic telescope was constructed before Rochon’s, yet this does not in the smallest degree take away from the originality and priority of Rochon’s invention; for the idea of varying the angle by the motion of the prisms can scarcely be viewed as an essential part of the invention.
[7:15:18]

Although the double refraction of rock-crystal is small, yet, from its limpidity and hardness, the Abbé Rochon regarded it as superior to any other substance for making doubly refracting prisms. When he used one prism so cut that its refracting edge coincided with the axis of the prism, in which case its double refraction was the greatest, he found that the separation of the two images was too small to-give the angles which he required.^[9. In his first experiments Rochon corrected the dispersion of the rock-crystal prism by a similar prism placed in front of it, and having its exterior face perpendicular to the axis of the crystal. This prism, having no effect in doubling the image, gave him a complete correction of the dispersion for the ordinary image.] He therefore fell upon a most ingenious plan of doubling the amount of the double refraction of one prism, by using two prisms of rock-crystal, so cut out of the solid as to give each the same quantity of double refraction, and yet to double that quantity in the effect produced. This construction of the compound prism was so difficult, that Μ. Rochon informs us, that “he knew only one person, Μ. Narci, who was capable of giving rock-crystal the prismatic form in the proper direction for obtaining the double refractions necessary to the goodness of the micrometer.” The method used by Narci seems to have been kept a secret, for in 1819 Dr Wollaston set himsèlf to discover the method of constructing these compound prisms, and has described it in the Philosophical Transactions,^[10. Phil. Trans. 1820, p. 126.] but not in such a manner as to be very intelligible to those who are not familiar with such subjects. We conceive that the process may be easily understood from the following rule. Cut a hexagonal prism of quartz into two halves by a plane passing through or parallel to its axis. Grind and polish the two cut faces, and by means of Canada balsam cement the one upon the other, so that any line or edge in the one face may be perpendicular to the same line in the other. Cut and polish a face on each of the united portions, so that the common section of these faces with the cemented planes may be parallel to the axis of the crystal, while they are equally inclined to these planes, and the prism will be completed.

We shall now'explain, by a diagram, a more simple and economical way of cutting these prisms, though the principle is exactly the same. Let AKGDBLHF be half of a hexagonal prism of quartz, the height of which, DF, is equal to half of its diameter AD. Bisect AD in C, and join CK, CG, and draw CE parallel to AB or DF. This line CE will be the axis of the prism. Grind and polish the section ABFD, and cut off the prisms AKCBLE and DGCFHE, setting aside the intermediate similar prism KGCLHF. The faces ACEB, DCEF arc square and equal, so that if we cement these faces together, making the line AB coincide with FE, AC will coincide with FD, CE with CF, and EB with CF. If we wish each prism to have an angle of 60°, we may take either GDFH or GCEH for the refracting face of it; we shall suppose the former. In this case we must grind and polish a face on the other prism ABL, which is accurately parallel to the face GDFH, and the compound prism will be completed. If 60° is too great, we must grind down the face GDFH till it has the desired inclination to DF, and grind and polish a face parallel to it on the other prism. The external faces, in short, to be made upon each prism, must be equally inclined to the cemented planes DCEF, ABEC, and have their common section DF parallel to the axis CE of the prism.

In place of cutting off the prism AKCBLE, we may cut off only the prism GCDHEF, leaving the intermediate one KGCLHE attached to AKCBLE, and proceed as before. The object of this is to leave enough of solid quartz at KL to give a face of the same breadth as GDFH. If the prisms required are small compared with the quartz crystal, we may obtain, by the first method, six prisms qut of the crystal, or three pair of compound ones. On the other hand, if the required prism is large compared with the crystal of quartz, it may require one half of the crystal to make one prism, and the other half the other. Nay, it may be necessary to cut each individual prism out of separate crystals, the method of doing which is very obvious from the preceding description.

When the prism is completed, it is obvious that a ray of light incident perpendicularly on the face GHFD wi∏ be perpendicular to the axis of the prism CE, and therefore the extraordinary ray will suffer the greatest deviation, viz. 17'; and the same is true of the other prism. But when the ray passes through both, it is found to have a deviation of 34', which is produced in the following manner: Let AB be a line viewed through one of the prisms, with its refracting angle turned upwards; two images of it will be seen, viz. the extraordinary image at E, and the ordinary one at 0.

If we now interpose the other prism with its refracting angle downwards, both these images E, O will be refracted downwards. But, owing to the transverse cutting of the prisms, the extraordinary image E, which was most raised, now suffers ordinary refraction, and is least depressed, so that in place of being refracted back to AB, it comes only to E'O'. On the other hand, the ordinary image 0, which suffered the least refraction, is now extraordinarily refracted, and, in place of reaching AB, is depressed to O'E'; and since the double refraction of each prism, as well as the angles of the prism, are equal, the angular distance of the images E'O', O'E ’ formed by the combined prisms will be double of the distance EO, or 34'.

The same rule may be followed in cutting the prism out of the limpid arid homogeneous topazes of New Holland, the principal axis of which coincides with the axis of the prism. When the crystals are amorphous, the cleavage planes will be a sufficient guide, as the above axis is always perpendicular to them. Such prisms are incomparably superior, as we have practically experienced, to those made of rock-crystal.

When a very large angle is required for any particular purposes, artificial crystals, such as carbonate of potash, &c. may be advantageously employed, the crystals being ground with oil, or any fluid in which they are not soluble. By cementing plates of parallel glass on their outer surfaces, they will be as permanent as rock-crystal.

Dr Pearson fitted up with one of Rochon’s micrometers an achromatic telescope 33 inches in focal length, and having a magnifying power of 35½. He applied to it two separate compound prisms, one of which had a constant angle of 32', and the other an angle only of 5', the vernier in the former case indicating seconds, and in the latter tenths of seconds. A drawing is given of the tube, with the prisms and scales, in Plate CCCLVII. fig. 9 and 10, as given by Dr Pearson. The tube is graduated from the [7:15:19] solar focus into two scales, one being placed on each side of the slit or opening cut along the middle of the tubes, to allow the sliding piece, shown separately in fig. 10, to move from the object-glass to the solar focus. This sliding piece holds the prism, the larger prism of 32' being shown as placed with its sliding piece in the tube, and the smaller prism of 5' being shown in the separate sliding piece, fig. 9. The two verniers of the scales are seen on each side of the two screws with milled beads, which pass through the slit, and serve to move the sliding piece to or from the object-glass when they are not too much tightened.

In his original memoir on the subject, published in the Journal de Physique for 1801,^[11. Translated in Nicholson’s Journal, 8vo, vol. iv. p. 110-120.] M.Rochon makes the following observations. “I ought not to omit, that in this new construction there are difficulties of execution not easy to surmount, which may have been one reason why these instruments, so useful to navigators, and in certain very nice astronomical observations, have not been adopted. This induced me at length to adopt Euler’s method. In the construction of achromatic object-glasses I found I could increase or diminish the absolute effect of the double refraction within certain limits, by means of the interval between the glasses of different refracting powers; the separation of the images at the focus being so much the greater, as the interval is larger, when the flint-glass is the first of the object-glasses, and less when it is the second. Conformably to these new principles, I have had two telescopes with a doubly refracting medium constructed under my own inspection, which General Gantheaumc will employ for determining the position of his ships, and to find whether he be approaching any he may meet with at sea.”^[12. It>id∙ p∙ 117∙]

In 1812 Μ. Rochon constructed his doubly refracting micrometer in another form, from which he anticipated great advantages. He made a parallelopiped of rock-crystal, consisting of two prisms whose refracting angles were each about 30°, so that the angle which they gave was less than 30', and the two images of the sun of course overlapped each other. The prisms being firmly united by mastic, he ground the parallelopiped into a convex lens, so that when combined with a concave one of flint-glass, it formed an achromatic object-glass with a focal length of about 3 decimetres, or nearly 12 inches. This object-glass separated the centres of the images of the sun about 28 minutes. “He then adapted to this objectglass a common micrometer, which measured angles of 10 minutes, and he had thus 3 decimetres and 10 minutes to complete the measure of the diameters of the sun or moon.”^[13. “This description is not very intelligible, but we cannot at present refer to the original memoir.]

Μ. Arago appears to have been the first person to apply doubly refracting prisms to the eye-pieces of telescopes for the purpose of measuring very small angles. He explained his general method to the writer of this article in July 1814, and mentioned the results which he had obtained with it in measuring the diameters of the planets. We do not recollect distinctly how he varied the constant angle of the doubly refracting prism; but Dr Pearson and ,Μ. Biot state,^[14. Introduction to Practical Astronomy, vol. ii. p. 20G-212.] that the constant angle was increased by placing the prism in an oblique direction as regards the line of vision; and “that he determined the respective values of the angles thus increased by means of concentric circles placed vertically at a measured distance from the eye wheïi looking through the prism; for as he knew the diameters of each circle, he could generally find one out of the number which would come into exact contact with its image, and thus give the value of the constant angle.”^[15. We regret that Μ. Arago has, in so far as we know, not published an account of his methods. What Dr Pearson says is not very intelligible. We presume his meaning to be, that Μ. Arago made his scale for measuring the varying angle of the images by direct experiment.]

Dr Pearson has proposed an ocular crystal micrometer, and has given a drawing and description of the instrument.^[16. Introd. Pract. Astron, vol. ii. p. 219.] It is nothing more than Μ. Arago’s ocular crystal prism, in which the constant angle is varied by Sir David Brewster’s variable eye-piece already described. On the same principle, the angle of the prism may be varied by a convex or concave lens moving between the object-glass and its principal focus; but what would be still better, by pulling out or pushing in the eye-piece of a Gregorian or Cassegrainian telescope.

In 1821 Mr George Dollond communicated to the Royal Society an account of his spherical crystal micrometer, a very ingenious instrument, though, we should think, one difficult to execute; and, at the same time, even when well executed, liable to error. Mr Dollond’s improvement consists in making a sphere or lens from a piece of rock-crystal, and adapting it to a telescope in place of the usual eye-glass, as shown in Plate CCCLVIL fig. 11, where a is the sphere or lens, formed of rock-crystal, and placed in half holes, from which is extended the axis bb, with an attached index, the face of which is shown in fig. 12. This index registers the motion of the sphere on the graduated circle. The sphere a is so placed in the half holes, that when its natural axis (axis of double refraction, we presume) is parallel to the axis of the telescope, it gives only one image of the object. In a direction perpendicular to that axis, it must be so placed that when it is moved the separation of the images may be parallel to that motion. The method of acquiring this adjustment is by turning the sphere a in the half holes parallel to its own axis. A second lens d is introduced between the sphere and the primary image given by the object-glass, and its distance from the sphere should be in proportion to the magnifying power required. The magnifying powers engraven in fig. 12 are suited to an object-glass of 44 inches focal length. The following are the advantages of this construction, as stated by its inventor. 1. It is only necessary to select a piece of perfect crystal, and, without any knowledge of the angle that will give the greatest double refraction, to form the sphere of a proper diameter for the focal length required. 2. The angle may be taken on each side of zero, without reversing the eye-tube; and intermediate angles may be taken between zero and the greatest separation of the images, without exchanging any part of the eye-tube, it being only required to move the axis in which the sphere is placed. 3. It possesses the property of a common eye-tube and lens; for when the axis of the crystal is parallel to that of the objpct-glass, only one image will be formed, and that as distinctly as with any lens that does not refract doubly.^[17. See Phil. Trans. 1821, p. 101-104.]

Dr Pearson had one of these instruments constructed by Mr Dollond, and applied to an achromatic object-glass 43∙6 inches in focal length. He has shown that the scale is not one of equal parts, and has pointed out a method of determining the constant angle of the crystal.

Knowing from experience the imperfect structure of rock-crystal, especially in directions approaching to the axis, we dreaded that a spherical eye-glass of this material would not give perfect vision. Dr Pearson confirms this opinion by actual observation. He attempted to measure the diameter of Mars when about 9", “but its limits were [7:15:20] so imperfectly defined that no satisfactory observation could be made.”^[18. Introd. Pract. Astron, vol. ii. p. 233.] We would therefore strongly recommend to Mr Dollond the substitution of limpid topaz from New Holland, in place of the rock-crystal.

CHAP. VI. DESCRIPTION OF POSITION MICROMETERS.

A position micrometer is an instrument for measuring angles when a plane passing through the two lines which contain these angles is perpendicular to the axis of vision. Sir W’. Herschel first proposed such an instrument for the purpose of verifying a conjecture, that the smaller of the two stars which compose a double star revolves round the larger one. Hence it became necessary to observe if a line joining the centres of any two stars always formed the same angle with the direction of its daily motion. After constructing the instrument which we are about to describe, and making a long series of observations, he verified his conjecture by the important discovery, that the double stars formed binary systems, in which the one revolved round the other.^[19. In the case of the double star Castor, this revolution is performed in 342 years.] The position micrometer used by Sir William Herschel in his earliest observations, viz. those made in 1779-1783, was made by Nairne, and was constructed as shown in Plate CCCLVII. fig. 13, which represents it when enclosed in. a turned case of wood, and ready to be screwed into the eye-piece of the telescope. “A is a little box which holds the eye-glass. B is the piece which covers the inside work, and the box A screwed into it. C is the body of the micrometer, containing the brass work, showing the index-plate a projecting at one side, where the case is cut away to receive it. D is a piece having a screw b at the bottom, by means of which the micrometer is fastened to the telescope. To the piece C is given a circular motion, in the manner the horizontal motion is generally given to Gregorian reflectors, by the lower part going through the piece D, where it is held by the screw E, which keeps the two pieces C and D together, but leaves them at liberty to turn on each other. Fig. 14 is a section of the case containing the brass work, where may be observed the piece B hollowed out to receive the box A, which consists of two parts enclosing the eye-lens. This figure shows how the piece C passes through D, and is held by the ring E. The brass work, consisting of a hollow cylinder, a wheel and pinion, and index-plate, is there represented in its place. F is the body of the brass work, being a hollow cylinder with a broad rim C at its upper end; this rim is partly turned away to make a bed for the wheel d. The pinion e turns the wheel d, and carries the index-plate a. One of its pivots moves in the arm f screwed on «the upper part of c, which arm serves also to confine the wheel d to its place on c. The other pivot is held by the arm g fastened to F.

A section of the brass work is shown in fig. 15, where the wheel d, which is in the form of a ring, is laid on the upper part of F or C, and held by two small arms / h, screwed down to e with the screws i, i.

A plan of the brass work is shown in fig. 16, where d d is the wheel placed on the bed or socket of the rim of the cylinder cc, and is held down by the two pieces ∕ Λ, which are screwed on cc. The piece ∕projects over the centre of the index-plate to receive the upper pivot of the pinion mn, the fixed wire being fastened to cc, and the moveable wire op, fastened to the annular wheel dd. The index-plate a, milled on the edge, is divided into sixty parts, each subdivided into two. V√hen the finger is drawn over the milled edge of the index-plate from q to r, the angle rnso will open, and if drawn from r towards q, it will shut again. The case cc must have a sharp corner t, which serves as an index to point out the divisions on the index-plate.^[20. Phil. Trans. 1781, p. 503.]

We do not know the value of the divisions in the instrument used by Sir William Herschel; but in the position micrometer of the five-feet equatorial used by Sir John Herschel and Sir James South, in their observations on double stars, the position circle was large enough to show distinctly minutes of a degree by means of its vernier.

The position micrometer which we have now described has been greatly improved by Sir David Brewster; and the following account of these improvements, which is not susceptible of abridgment, is given in his own words.

In the position micrometer invented by Sir William Herschel, “the two wires always cross each other at the centre of the field, and consequently their angular separation is produced uniformly by the motion of the pinion. This very circumstance, however, though it renders it easy for the observer to read off the angle from the scale, is one of the greatest imperfections of the instrument. The observations must obviously be all made on one side of the centre of the field, as appears from fig. 16; and the use of the instrument is limited to those cases in which Ss is less than the radius SC. The greatest disadvantage of the instrument, however, is the shortness of the radius SC; for the error of observation must always diminish as the length of this raditfs increases. This disadvantage does not exist in measuring the angle of position of two stars S, s, for the distance Ss remains the same whatever be the length of SC; but in determining the angle which a line joining two stars forms with a line joining other two stars, or those which compose a double star (an observation which it may often be of great importance to make), and all other angles contained by lines whose apparent length is greater than SC, this imperfection is inseparable from the instrument. Nay, there are some cases in which the instrument completely fails; as, for instance, when we wish to measure the angles formed by two lines which do not meet in a focus, but only tend to a remote vertex. If the distance of the nearest extremities of these lines is greater than the chord of the angle which they form measured upon the radius SC, then it is impossible to measure that angle, for the wires cannot be brought to coincide with the lines by which it is contained. Nay, when the chord of the angle does exceed the distance between the nearest extremities, the position of the wires which can be brought into coincidence with the lines is so small as to lead to very serious errors in the result.

The new position micrometer which we propose to substitute for this instrument is free from the defects just noticed, and is founded on a beautiful property of the circle. If any two chords, AB, CD, fig. 12, intersect each other in the point O within the circle, the angle which they form at 0 will be equal to half the sum of the arches AC, BD; but if these chords do not intersect each other within the circle, but tend to any point 0 without the circle, when they would intersect each other if continued, as in fig. 13, then the angle which they form is equal to half the difference of the arches AC, BD; that is, calling <ρ the angle required, we have, in the first case, as shown in fig. 12,

AC + BD , . l <f> — ·_·; and in the second case, as shown in fig.
[7:15:21]

13, <p — g BD . Hence, if the two wires AB, CD be placed in the focus of the first eye-glass of a telescope, the moveable one AB may be made to form every possible angle with the fixed one CD, and that angle may be readily found from the arches AB, CD.

The mechanism for measuring these arches is shown in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 17, where the graduated circular head CD may be divided only into 180°, in order to save the trouble of halving the sum or the difference of the arches AC, BD; but as it would still be necessary to measure two arches before the angle could be ascertained, we have adopted another method, remarkable for its simplicity, and giving no more trouble than if the wires always intersected each other in the centre of the field.

Let AB, for example, fig. 13, be the fixed wire, and CD the moveable one, and let it be required to find at one observation the angle AOC or ç>. Set the index of the vernier to zero when D coincides with B; and as C will be at c when D is at B, the arch cAwill beaconstantquantity, which we shall call b. Making AC = m, and BD = n i we have <p ~ m n . But since the extremity C will move over the space Cc while D describes the space DB, these arches must be equal, consequently b = rn — η ; hcnce, adding 2n to each side of the equation, we obtain b + 2n 1 1 m + n . = m + n i or ½ o + n = —~—, consequently φ = ½ b + η. Hence the angle AOC is equal to half the arch Ac added to the arch DB; or, since Ac is invariable, the half of it is a constant quantity, and the angle required is equal to the sum of this constant quantity and the arch DB.

When the wires do not intersect each other, as in fig. 13, we have φ — m ¾ , and b = m + n; hence, sub-trading 2n from each side of the equation, we have b — 2n = nι — n i and, dividing by 2, we have ½ b — n = ———, consequently <f> = ½ b — n. That is, the angle AOC is equal to the difference between half the arch Ac and the arch DB, or to a constant quantity diminished by the arch DB.

In finding the angle AOC, therefore, we have merely to observe the place of the index when the wires are in their proper position; and as the scale commences at B, or where D and B coincide, and is numbered both ways from B, tbe degree pointed out on the circular head CD, when increased or diminished by the constant quantity, will give the angle of the wires which is sought. The semicircle on each side of a diameter drawn through B is divided into 180°, the 180th degree being at the opposite end of that diameter.

We may simplify still further the method of reading off the angle AOC, so as to save the trouble even of recollecting the constant quantity, and of adding it to, or subtracting it from, the arch pointed out by the index of the vernier. This advantage is obtained by making the index of the vernier point to the constant quantity upon the part of the scale below B, fig. 12, when the points D, B coincide, or when the wire CD is in the dotted position cB; for it is obvious that if z marks the zero of the scale, and Bz is equal to the constant quantity, the arch Oz, which is pointed out by the index of the vernier, will be equal to ½ b + n y or the angle AOC. In like manner, in fig. 13, where the wires do not cross each other within the field, and where Bz is the constant quantity, the arch Dz marked out by the index of the vernier is obviously equal to ½ó—n, or the angle AOC, which the wires tend to form at 0. By means of this adjustment, therefore, we are able to read off the angle AOC with the same facility as if the wires intersected each other in the centre of the field, when the arches are accurate measures of the angles at the centre.

The end of the eye-tube is represented in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 17, where the circular head CD is divided into 360°, and subdivided by the vernier V. L is the level, and AB the part of the eye-piece which contains the diaphragm, with the fixed and moveable wires. The head CD, and the level L, are firmly fixed to the eye-tube T; and from the head CD there rises an annular shoulder, concentric with the tube, and containing the diaphragm, across which the fixed wire is stretched. This diaphragm, which is rcpre≠ sented in fig 18, with the wire extended across, projects through the circle of brass EF. All these parts remain immoveable, while the outer tube AB, and the other half EF, of the circular head which contains the vernier V, have a rotatory motion upon the shoulder, which rises from CD. The tube AB is merely an outer case, to protect a little tube within it, which contains the eye-glass, and the moveable diaphragm, with its wire extended across it. The enclosed tube is screwed into the ring EF, and the outer tube is also screwed upon the same ring, so that by moving AB, a motion of rotation is communicated to the vernier V, and to the diaphragm and wire belonging to the inner tube, while the rest of the eye-piece, containing the other diaphragm with its wire, remains stationary. By these means the moveable wire is made to form every possible angle with the fixed wire, and the angle is determined by the method which we have already explained. The fixed wire is placed a good deal ont of the centre of the diaphragm to which it belongs; and the diaphragm itself is placed in a cell, in which it can be turned round so as to adjust the wire to a horizontal line when the level is set. The moveable wire is likewise placed at a distance from the>centre of its diaphragm, as shown in Plate CCCLVIH. fig. 19; but, by means of screws which pass through the inner tube into the edge of this diaphragm, it can be moved in a plane at right angles to the axis of the eye-piece, so that the moveable wire may be placed either in the centre of the field or at different distances from it.

The double-image micrometer affords a convenient method of measuring angles of position; and we believe this application of it was first made by Sir David Brewster.

In every instrument in which a double image of an object is formed by means of two semi-lenses with their centres at a distance, the one image appears to have a rotatory motion round the other when the telescope is turned about its axis. Thus, in Plate CCCLVIIL fig. 20, if A, B be images of two objects formed by the upper semi-lens when the common diameter of the semi-lenses is perpendicular to the horizon, and C, D the images of the same objects formed by the lower semi-lens; then, by turning the telescope about its axis, or the semi-lenses round in their tube, the image A will appear to move round C in the circle A«E, and the image B round D in the circle B6F, or in the opposite direction if the telescope, or the semi-lenses, arc turned the other way. When the distance AC is equal to CD, as in fig. 21, the image A will pass over the image D; or if the telescope is turned in the opposite direction, the image B will pass over the image C. In like manner, when AC is greater or less than CD, the images will move as we have represented them in fig. 20 and 22. In all these cases the four images may be brought into one straight line; and when this takes place, [7:15:22] the line which passes through all the images will uniformly form the same angle with the horizon, as the common diameter of the semi-lenses. It is very easy to ascertain with the utmost accuracy when the images form one straight line; but particularly in the case where AC, fig. 21, is equal to CD, for the image of A will then pass over D; and the coincidence of the images will mark the instant when the line which joins them is parallel to the common diameter of the lenses. Hence, as we obtain by this means the relation of the line joining the images to a fixed line in the instrument, the relation of this line to the horizon may be easily found by means of a level, and a divided circular head. If the image is a straight line (fig. 22), then the coincidence of the two images, so as to form one straight line, will indicate the parallelism of that line to the diameter of the semi-lenses.

In constructing a micrometer of this kind solely for the purpose of measuring angles when the eye is not at their vertex, either the object-glass or the third eye-glass might be made the divided lens. If the object-glass is divided, it should be so constructed that it may have a rotatory motion in its cell, by applying the hand to a milled circumference AB, Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 23. Connected with the tube TT of the telescope is a circular ring of brass CD divided into 360°; and the divisions upon this scale are pointed out by the index of a vernier v, which moves along with the semi-lenses. A level L is fixed to the plate AB, having its axis parallel to the common diameter of the lenses, and being adjusted to a horizontal line when the index points to the zero of the scale. In using the instrument, therefore, the observer turns round the semi-lenses by means of the projecting milled circumference AB, till the coincidence of the two images is distinctly perceived. The index of the vernier will then point out upon the graduated head the inclination of the line which is required.

When the telescope is long, this form of the instrument, though extremely simple, is not very convenient. The construction represented in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 24, is in general to be preferred. This instrument consists of three tubes BL, LC, CA. At the extremity B of the first tube is placed the divided object-glass, and at the other extremity L is fixed the divided circular head EF. The tube CL, which remains always at rest, is fixed to the stand HI by means of the clasp and screw at H. The tube AC, which contains an eye-piece, moves within both the tubes CL and LB. The tube BL extends towards C within the tube CL, and round its circumference are cut a number of teeth, in which the endless 'screw G works, and thus gives a rotatory motion to the tube LB and the divided head EF. By this means the common diameter of the semi-lenses at B is made to form every possible angle with a horizontal line, which is indicated-by a level above L, having its axis parallel to the common diameter of the semi-lenses. The index of the vernier v, fixed to the stationary tube CL, points out on the graduated head the angle required. When the instrument is constructed so that the semi-lenses are in the eye-piece, the graduated head must be placed in the eye-tube.

If the principle of this micrometer is applied to the double-image micrometer described in Chap. IV. in which a pair of fixed semi-lenses moves between the object-glass and its principal focus, we obtain an instrument which will measure at the same observation the angle subtended at the eye of the observer by a line joining two points, and likewise the angle which that line forms with the horizon or any other line. When the two images of the line which joins the two points are brought into contact by the motion of the semi-lenses along the axis of the tube, these images must necessarily be in the same straight line, so that the relation of that line to the horizon, or to any other given line, and the contact of the two images of it which determines its angular magnitude, are obtained simultaneously, without any additional observation or adjustment.

Dr Pearson has given some very useful details respecting the use of double-image micrometers in measuring angles of position.^[21. Introd, to Practical Astron, vol. ii. p. 25ð.]

When the brightness of the two stars which compose a double star is considerable, their discs may be drawn out into lines of light either by cylindrical refraction or reflection, and the coincidence of these lines will furnish the means of determining the angle of position.

A position micrometer upon a new principle has been proposed by Sir David Brewster. He expands the images of the two stars into luminous discs till they overlap each other. The southern limb of the lower disc is then made to move along the fixed wire of the position micrometer. A line joining the two points where the circumferences of the discs intersect each other, is obviously perpendicular to a line joining the centres of the stars, and will therefore form an angle with the fixed wire-equal to the complement of the angle of position required. If we therefore make the moveable wire pass through the two points where the luminous discs intersect each other, the micrometer scale will give the complement of the angle of position.^[22. Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments, p. 45.]

CHAP. VII. DESCRIPTION OF THE LAMP MICROMETER

AND THE LUCID-DISC MICROMETER.

In measuring the distances and angle of position of double stars, Sir William Herschel encountered many practical difficulties which interfered with the accuracy of his results. The uncertainty of the real zero of his scale, the inflexion of light, the imperfections of the screws and divided bars and pinions, and the difficulty of obtaining fibres sufficiently minute for his purpose, but, above all, the disappearance of small stars by the illumination of the wire, led this eminent astronomer to the contrivance of his lamp micrometer, which, while it is exempt from these sources of error, has also the advantage of a large scale.

Thelampιnicrometer is represented in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 25, where AB is the upright part of the stand, 9 feet high, upon which a wooden semicircle qhogp, 14 inches radius, may be fixed at different heights, by a peg p put into holes in the stand. An arm L, 30 inches long, moves round a pivot in the centre of the board by means of the handle P, which works by a string eqho fastened to a hook at the back of L. The arm L is kept at any inclination to the horizon by the weight of the handle P, which is 10 feet long. A small slider b, about 3 inches long, moves along the front of L towards and from the centre at n, by means of the handle rD, which operates by a string passing over the pulley m, and , returning by η to a barrel at τ, while a second string bnw, with a weight w, causes the slider b to return to the centre. The end of the arm L is shown on a large scale in fig. 26.

Two lamps a, b, figs. 27 and 28, 1½ inch high and 1∣ inch deep, having sliding doors with small apertures made with a fine needle opposite the flame òf a single cotton-thread wick, so that when the sliders are shut down, nothing is seen but two fine lucid points like stars of the third or fourth magnitude. The lamp α is placed at the centre τι, so that its lucid point may occupy that centre, while b is hung on the slider S, so that its lucid point may be in a line with the lucid point of a when the arm L has a horizontal position.

A person, therefore, at a distance of teu feet r may govern [7:15:23] the two lucid points so as to bring them into any required position by the handle P; and by the handle D he may place them at any distance, from six tenths of an inch to twenty-five inches.

In using this micrometer, SirW. Herschel placed it ten feet from his left eye, while with his right he viewed a double star through his Newtonian reflector. By means of his left eye the double star is seen projected upon the micrometer, and he then placed his two lucid points at such a distance that they were exactly covered by the stars. The distance of the lucid points was the tangent of the magnified angles subtended by the stars to a radius of ten feet. This angle, therefore, being divided by the magnifying power of the telescope, gives the real angular distance of the centres of a double star. With a power of 460 the scale was a quarter of an inch for every second. Sir W. Herschel, in measuring the apparent diameter of α Lyrae with this instrument, used a magnifying power of 6450. The magnified angle was 38' 10", so that the real 38 ’ 10"

angle was - √v l >∩ = 0"∙355, giving on this occasion a scale Oτt l O U

of no less than 8½ inches to a second.^[23. Phil. Trans, vol. Ixxiì. p. 102.]

In using high magnifying powers, Sir W. Herschel employed another apparatus called the lucid-disc micrometer. A lucid disc made of oiled paper, or any other semi-transparent substance, was placed in the front slider of a lantern, and illuminated by a flame behind it. The lantern was then removed to a distance till the diameter of the disc appeared equal to that of a planet seen in the telescope, so that the angular diameter of the planet became known by dividing the angle subtended by the disc by the magnifying power of the telescope. The result was affected by the colour of the disc and the degree of illumination. The measure was always too small when the illumination was strong, and too great when a black disc was placed on an illuminated ground. Hence Sir William Herschel took a mean of the two as the true measure.

Μ. Schroeter of Lilienthal, in measuring the diameters of the four new planets, used a lucid-disc micrometer, which we presume was not much different from Sir W. Herschel’s.

Dr Pearson constructed and used an analogous instrument, in which the left eye looked into a tube containing a system of lines upon a disc of glass, or a spider’s line micrometer, so that the object seen with the right eye was projected against these divisions, and its angular diameter ascertained.^[24. Introd. Tract. Astron, vol. ii. p. 245.]

CHAP. VIII DESCRIPTION OF FIXED MICROMETERS WITH

AN INVARIABLE SCALE.

The earliest fixed micrometer of which we have a distinct account is that of Huygens, who placed a circular diaphragm in the focus of the eye-glass of his telescope, and found its angular value to be seventeen and a quarter minutes by the time which a star took to pass across it. He then formed two or three long brass plates of different breadths so as to form wedges of different angles. In measuring the diameter of a planet with one of these, he made one of them slide through two slits in the opposite sides of the tube, so that the plane of the brass wedges touched the plane of the circular diaphragm; and having observed in what part of the wedge its breadth just covered the whole planet, he took this breadth in a pair of compasses, and having found what part it was of the whole aperture, he divided seventeen and a quarter minutes by this part, and obtained the diameter required. Sir Isaac

Newton has stated, that the measures thus taken are always in excess. Had Huygens used long wedge-shaped slits or openings, he would by the same process have obtained measures which erred in defect, and the mean between these two measures would have given the true diameter of the planet.

The reticulum or fixed micrometer, composed of wires, was invented and used by Cassini. It is shown in the annexed figure, where ab, cd, ef, gh, are four hairs or wires intersecting each other at right angles at i, in the focus of the eye-glass, ab, cd being inclined 45° to ef and gk. In order to find with this apparatus the differences of the right ascension and declination of two stars, direct the telescope so that the first or preceding star may appear upon the wire ab, and turn round the tube till that star moves along ab. The time when this star reaches i is carefully noted, and also the time when the following star reaches the wire ed. The interval between these times, converted into degrees, is the difference of right ascension required. To find the difference of their declinations, mark the time of the second or following star’s arrival at the points k and l of the oblique wires ef, gh. The half of the interval between these times is the time in which the star describes the space lm or mk, which, converted into degrees a, is the angular distance lm, which, multiplied by the cosine of the declination of the known or preceding star, gives an approximate difference, which, when applied to the declination of the known star, gives the approximate declination of the unknown or following star. If we now multiply the angular value of lm by the cosine of this approximate declination, we shall have the correct difference of declination, which, applied to the declination of the known star, will give the true declination of the unknown star.

In using the above reticulum, Dr Bradley found his observations embarrassed by the crossing of all the wires at i, which hid the preceding star at the very point where it was required to be most distinctly seen. He therefore proposed the construction shown in the annexed figure, where the wires hg, hi, intersect one another perpendicularly at f, the centre of the rings. Two slender bars of brass pg, og are fixed to the ring abc, and inclined each to the diameter hg 26° 34', half the angle of a rhomb whose greater diagonal is double of the lesser. Hence fk and f i will be each one half of fg, hi = fg, and fm = nl — ik. To avoid the inconvenience of turning the telescope about its axis, Dr Bradley placed the ring abc, which carries the wires or brass bars in a groove in the fixed ring ABC, and, confining it laterally by three pieces of brass at A, B, and C, he employed an endless screw DEF to work in a toothed rack de, fixed to the inner ring abc. Let us now suppose the telescope so directed that a star is at f, and moving in any line fg ; then, by turning the milled head D, the wire/Ãwill move round/till it touches the star at g, and will then lie in the direction of the star’s motion, while all other stars will move parallel to it. The mode of obtaining accurate results from this apparatus will be understood[7:15:24] from the following description of an analogous contrivance described by Lacaille.

This eminent astronomer used a rhomb FMIL, the diagonals of which, FI, ML, must be exactly perpendicular to one another, and as two to one. The length F was 15 ’ 4 lines, the angle subtended by ML 1° 25'∙5, and consequently FI 2° 50' 10", as determined by the passage of several of the equatorial stars. Now, as the vertical height of each triangle in the rhomb is equal to the short diagonal, the path of any star passing through the field in a line parallel to that diagonal will always cut off a similar triangle, and the distance of this path from the common apex will have the same ratio to the vertical height of the large triangle, one half FI, or ML, that the value of the diagonal in time has to the observed time of the passage. Hence the time which any star takes to pass from m to Z, reduced to degrees, and multiplied by the cosine of the declination, is the difference of declination required. The difference of right ascension is obtained as before. With this simple apparatus, Lacaille observed the comparative right ascensions and declinations of the 1942 stars which are given in his Coelum Australe Stelliferum. Lacaille constructed another reticulum, in which ML was one fourth of FI.

Mr Wollaston employed a reticulum similar to that shown in the annexed figure, AB being the horary line, and CD the equatorial line. The four squares being within the field, any of them may be used separately, so that observations made successively in a pair of them will check each other as well as the principal observation made in the large right-angled triangle. As the diagonals are equal to one another, they afford a larger passage of a star, and thus increase the accuracy of the observation.

Μ. Valz^[25. Zach’s Correspondance Astronomique, tom. i. p∙ 353.] of Nismes has proposed the reticulum shown in fig. 18, as possessing several advantages over others. It consists of three wires AB, CD, AD, and the equatorial one MN perpendicular to AB, CD. The arches AC, CM, MD, DB, &c. are all 60°. When the stars pass parallel to the equator, the angle formed at the vertex A or B will be 30°, and its cotangent = √3 = 1·732; therefore, calling t the line of passage of one star from the first to the second wire, and tl that of the other star, the difference of declination will be 1∙732 (∑±z t zψz f), and the difference of right ascension will be had from the times of the stars passing the middle of the space between CD and AB, or the means of the times of passing CD and AB. Baron Zach observes, that this reticulum requires no illumination, that the values of its lines do not require to be known, and that it maybe used out of exact adjustment to the parallel of declination, as the corrections for such want of adjustment are easily computed.

The fixed net-micrometer of Fraunhofer is shown in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 29. The vertical and oblique lines shown in the figure are cut upon glass with fluoric acid or dia mond, and the plate has a circular motion in its cell. These lines are illuminated by light passing through the eye-tube and falling on their cut edges, so that no light passes down the tube. The lines parallel to ef are adjusted perpendicular to a circle of declination, and in that position the oblique light of the lamp illuminates both the vertical and inclined lines. The mutual distances both of the vertical and inclined lines are known from the machine by which they were drawn, and hence the ratio of the times of transit of a star from the vertical to the inclined lines will enable us to determine the position of these in reference to a circle of declination. “The great number of lines,” says Dr Pearson, “afford the means of making several observations, which, on an average, will give right ascensions and declinations equally exact, whether the differences of declination be great or small. When the difference of right ascension is small, as in the case of double stars, the transit of both stars cannot well be observed over the same individual line, but one of them may be observed at the first, and the other at the second line, alternately, till the observer is satisfied with his observation; and should the network experience an alteration of position from any cause, it will in all probability be detected before the computation is commenced. The ingenious artist contrived an engine by which he could cut straight parallel lines at distances so small as τσ ½ σπ un R s from each other, and to be crossed by other parallel lines at any given angle of declination; and in the net-micrometer he formed the parallel lines at such a distance from each other that the inclined intervals bear the same proportion to the vertical intervals that the cosine of the angle of inclination bears to radius, so that about as tnany transits will take place over the inclined tu as over the vertical lines. Five lines only are drawn at equal distances from each other, and the sixth line, including the fifth interval, is cut at the distance of one interstice and a half; yet the whole value of any number of intervals may always be known, provided it be noticed how many of the larger kind are included in the whole number. When the cell containing the disc is attached to a revolving graduated circle, the position of a line uniting two stars may also be measured, by first adjusting zero to the equatorial position of the line fg, and then turning the divided disc round till all its parallels successively receive both the stars at the same instant as they pass through the field, which contemporary ingresses may be effected by repeated adjustments and subsequent trials, when the telescope is mounted on an equatorial stand properly rectified.^[26. ! Introd. Pract. Astron, vol. ii. p. 143.]

Another micrometer of Fraunhofer’s is shown in Plate CCCLVI1I. fig. 30, and consists of concentric circles cut upon glass, and illuminated like the preceding one. The inner and smallest circle is like a dot. Other five circles are seen in a telescope of fi,ve feet focal length, magnifying 110 times. With a power of 63, eight circles are visible; and with the lowest power of 45, eleven circular lines are visible. The observer may choose any circle he likes for observing the passage of the star, avoiding those in which it would pass near the centre or near the circumference. The observation, too, may be made with more rings than one. The following are the dimensions of the circles in one of these instruments.
[table]
[7:15:25]

By subtracting these numbers from one another, we obtain the breadths of the spaces between the rings.

Fraunhofer’s suspended annular micrometer, which is a more perfect instrument than the preceding, is shown in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 31, which represents a disc of glass, having a hole in its centre a little larger than the inner diameter of a metallic ring oo, turned truly in a lathe. This ring is cemented on the glass disc, and when placed in the field of view of a telescope, the observer notes the instants when, a star on the limb of a planet enters and emerges from each side of the ring. The only data required for computing the difference of right ascension and declination, are the times that an equatorial star takes to pass along the internal and external diameters of the ring. The passage of stars whose relative position is required, must be observed at a distance from the centre, as well as from the upper edge of the ring. The formulae of Bessel for using this and other circular micrometers will be found in Zach’s Monailiche Correspοndenz, vol. xvii. xxiv. and xxvi.

A simple and useful fixed micrometer, proposed by Mr Cavallo, is a divided slip of thin mother-of-pearl stretching across the diaphragm of the telescope, and finely divided into 200ths of an inch. It is shown in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 32, crossing the diaphragm of the telescope. The value of the division maybe ascertained either by measuring a bar, or by the passage of an equatorial star across the field of view.

In a portable telescope this micrometer is very convenient, though it has the great disadvantage of shutting out the field of view. In telescopes upon stands it will measure only angles in one direction, unless there is a contrivance to turn it round. This micrometer has also the additional imperfection, that its divisions, from being unequally distant from the eye-glass, are not all seen with the same distinctness.

To remove these imperfections, Sir David Brewster proposed, in 1805, the circular mother-of-pearl micrometer, which is shown in Plate CCCLVIII.fig.33, where the black ring which forms part of the figure is the diaphragm of the telescope, and the more luminous part is an annular portion of mother-of-pearl divided on its inner circumference into 360°. This divided circumference can be placed exactly in the focus of the eye-glass, and all its parts seen with perfect distinctness. In order to understand the use of the instrument, let Ay>B be the inner edge of the mother-of-pearl ring, and mη the object to be measured. Bisect the arch rnn in p, and draw Cm, Cp, Cη, and we shall have AB: rnn = rad.: sin. and 1 ∏ρn — s j rb ∙%mpn χAB, a formula by which rad. j the angle subtended by the chord of any number of degrees may be readily found. The first part of the formula is constant, while AB varies with the magnifying power employed.

CHAP. IX.—DESCRIPTION OF MICROMETERS FOR MICRO

SCOPES.

All the micrometers above described may be adapted to compound microscopes, where the eye-glass has a considerable focal length. A good micrometer, however, for single microscopes, which can be used with facility, and at the same time give accurate results, is still a desideratum. When the single lens is so minute, or when the first lens of a microscopic doublet or triplet almost touches the surface of the object, it is an extremely difficult matter to introduce any scale, or any minute body of known dimensions, with which the object may be compared. In some cases, when the object to be measured is minute, the seed of the lycopeτdon bovista or puff-ball might be introduced, its diameter being about the τr ⅛ σ th part of an inch; and when the object is less minute, the seed of lycopodium may be used, its diameter being 9 ½ π th of an inch. We may advantageously adopt, in some cases, the method of Dr Jurin,^[27. Physico-Mathematical Dissertations, p. 45.] who introduced into the field small pieces of silver or brass wire, whose diameter he had previously ascertained by coiling the wire round a cylinder, and observing how many breadths of z the wire were contained in a given number of inches.

This method of introducing a substance of known dimensions may be carried much farther. We may use all the variety of hairs and wool which have a known diameter; and for this purpose Dr Young’s .tables of substances measured by the eriometer will be of great use. The following are a few of them:
[table]

1he distance of the fibres of the crystalline lens of fishes may also be advantageously used, and also the distance of the teeth which unite the fibres. For this purpose, the lens must be well dried, and perfectly hard, so that with a sharp knife we can detach minute portions of any of the laminae. The thinnest should be used; and as the fibres always taper to the pole, and the teeth become smaller in proportion as the fibres diminish, we must determine the distance of the fibres, and also those of the teeth, at both ends of the laminae, by the method described by Sir David Brewster in the Philosophical Transactions for 1833, p. 324. The larger lined scales of moths and butterflies may also be used, especially as we can measure the distance of the lines by the coloured spectra which these lines produce.^[29. The late Mr Pond has observed, that the pale, slender, double-headed scales of the Poηtiα or Pieris brassica, which taper to a point, and terminate in a brush-like appendage, are of an invariable length, about⅛th of an inch.] These operations will require much dexterity on the part of the observer, and they are recommended only to those who cannot succeed in their measurements by other methods.

An excellent method of measuring microscopic objects is to project the image of the object against a divided scale, at a given distance from the eye. The scale must be seen either by the same eye which is looking into the microscope, or by the other eye. In the first case, the rays from the microscope will enter one side of the pupil, and the rays from the divided scale the other side; the aperture through which we look at the scale, and the aperture of the microscope, being at a distance less than the diameter of the pupil. When the right eye looks at the divided scale, the left, which looks into the microscope, will see the object projected against the scale, although it has no vision of the scale itself. This second method may be carried into effect in two ways. The scale may form no part [7:15:26] of the instrument, and may be viewed by the naked eye; or it may form part of the instrument, like a binocular telescope, the left eye looking into one tube, viz. the microscope, while the right eye looks into another tube, in which a divided scale is magnified by an eye-lens.

Dr Wollaston has constructed and used a very ingenious micrometer on the first of the principles above mentioned, viz. when the object and the scale are viewed by the same eye; but its use is limited to microscopes with small lenses. When the lenses are larger, we have adopted another method, namely, to perforate the lens with a small hole in or near the centre, or, if it is thought better, near the margin of the lens. A slit extending from the margin of the lens may often be executed more easily.

The following is Dr Wollaston’S own description of this instrument:

“This instrument,” says Dr Wollaston, “is furnished with a single lens of about ⅛th of an inch focal length. The aperture of each lens is necessarily small, so that when it is mounted on a plate of brass, a small perforation can be made by the side of it in the brass, as near to its centre as ⅛th of an inch.

“When a lens thus mounted is placed before the eye for the purpose of examining any small object, the pupil is of sufficient magnitude for seeing distant objects at the same time through the adjacent perforation, so that the apparent dimensions of the magnified image might be compared with a scale of inches, feet, and yards, according to the distance at which it might be convenient to place it.

“A scale of smaller dimensions, attached to the instrument, will, however, be found preferable, on account of the steadiness with which the comparison may be made; and it may be seen with sufficient distinctness by the naked eye, without any effort of nice adaptation, by reason of the smallness of the hole through which it is viewed.

“The construction that I have chosen for the scale is represented in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 33. It is composed of small wires about 2 ⅛th of an inch in diameter, placed side by side so as to form a scale of equal parts, which may be with ease counted by means of a certain regular variation of the lengths of the wires.

“The external appearance of the whole instrument is that of a common telescope consisting of three tubes. The scale occupies the place of the object-glass, and the little lens is situated at the smaller end, with a pair of plain glasses sliding before it, between which the subject of examination is to be included. This part of the apparatus is shown separately in fig. 35. It has a projection, with a perforation, through which a pin is inserted to connect it with a screw, represented at b, fig. 34. This screw gives lateral motion to the object, so as to make it correspond with any particular part of the scale. The lens has also a small motion of adjustment, by means of the cape, fig. 36, which renders the view of the magnified object distinct.

“Before the instrument is completed, it is necessary to determine with precision the indications of the scale, which must be different, according to the distance to which the tube is drawn out. In my instrument, one division of the scale corresponds to τσ ⅛ ππ th of an inch when it is at the distance of 16∙6 inches from the lens; and since the apparent magnitude in small angles varies in the simple inverse ratio of this distance, each division of the same scale will correspond to y ⅛ π th at the distance of 8 τ ¾ inches; and the intermediate fractions ∙ δ7 ⅛ π , 7 - l ,

&c. are found by intervals of 1∙66 inch, marked°on °th°e outside of the tube. The basis on which these indications were founded in this instrument was a wire, carefully ascertained to be g⅜(yth of an inch in diameter, the magnified image of which occupied fifty divisions of the scale when it was at the distance of 16∙6 inches; and hence one divi-

sion = so X ¾oo = īōöōō' slnce any error in the original estimate of this wire must pervade all subsequent measures derived from it, the substance employed was pure gold drawn till fifty-two inches in length weighed exactly five grains. If we assume the specific gravity of gold to be 19-36, a cylindrical inch will weigh 3837 grains; and we may hence infer the diameter of such a wire to be ^⅛(>th of an inch, more nearly than can be ascertained by any other method.

“For the sake of rendering the scale more accurate, a similar method was, in fact, pursued with several gold wires of different sizes, weighed with equal’ care; and the subdivisions of the exterior scale were made to correspond with the average of their indications.

“In making use of this micrometer for taking the measure of any object, it would be sufficient, at any one accidental position of the tube, to note the number on the outside as denominator, and to observe the number of divisions and decimal parts which the subject of examination occupies on the interior scale as numerator of a fraction, expressing its dimensions in proportional parts of an inch; but it is preferable to obtain an integer as numerator, by sliding the tube inward or outward, till the image of the wire is seen to correspond with some exact number of divisions, not only for the sake of greater simplicity in the arithmetical computations, but because we can by the eye judge more correctly of actual coincidence than of the comparative magnitudes of adjacent intervals. The smallest quantity which the graduations of this instrument profess to measure, is less than the eye can really appreciate ∙ in sliding the tube inward or outward. If, for instance, the object measured be really ^ πy , it may appear τ θ⅛ π77 , or -g⅛θ, in which case the doubt amounts to y 1 θth part of the wlιole quantity. But the difference is here exceedingly small in comparison to the extreme division of other instruments, where the nominal effect of its power is. the same.

“A micrometer with a divided eye-glass may profèss to measure as far as τσ ⅛ ππ of an inch; but the next division is Tōoōō or 3^⅛σ ’ a11d though the eye may be able ’ to distinguish that the truth lies between the two, it receives no assistance within one-half part of the larger measure.”^[30. Phil. Trans. 1813, p. 119.]

The micrometer microscopes used for reading off the divisions on the graduated limb of astronomical instruments differ in no respect from the eye-pieces of telescopes fitted up with micrometers.

Notwithstanding the value of the methods described above, the want of a simple micrometer for microscopes of high power is felt by every person who has been practically occupied with this class of researches; and we cannot give a better proof of this than by adducing in support of our opinion the different measures that have been given by able and ingenious observers of the size of the particles of the human blood.

The three measures of 1000, 2000, and 2500, have been recently given by Mr Bauer himself, as the different steps which he made towards what he conceives the best measure, viz. 1-2500th, which he obtained repeatedly with an improved achromatic microscope. As Dr Young obtained his measure criometrically, namely, by measuring the diameter of the first red ring produced by looking through the blood at a luminous object, we cannot conceive it possible that he could have committed such a mistake as to make the diameter of that ring nearly thrice as great as it should be, according to Mr Bauer’s results, or more than thrice as great as the concurring measures obtained by Jurin and Leewenhoeck. The only explanation we can give is, that the particles of the blood must have an organized structure, or consist of portions separated by lines which have the magnitude assigned by Dr Young. In order to submit this explanation to the test of experiment, Sir David Brewster examined the particles of blood a few minutes after it was drawn, when dried by natural evaporation on a plate of glass. Each particle he found to consist of a dark rim, within which is a bright circle, then a darkish central spot, which spot in some globules may be resolved into a dark ring, a bright ring within this, and then a small central black spot. Here, then, is the cause of Dr Young’s mistake. The red ring of light which he measured in the eriometer was not that which was due to the globule as a whole, but to the parts of the globule. Being anxious to obtain more complete evidence of this fact, we placed lycopodium powder beside the globule of blood, and found that the diameter of the globules was to that of the lycopodium seed as 5 to 18. We then compared the diameter of the red ring produced by the seed with the diameter of the red ring produced by division on steel, in which there were 1250 to the inch, as executed for us by the late Sir John Barton, and found the diameter of the seed to be the 697th of an inch. We compared it also with the ring produced by divisions of which there were 625 to the inch, and found its diameter the 717th part of an inch. The mean of these two is the 710th^[33. Dr Young makes this the 940th of an inch, but he has certainly committed a mistake in his observation.] part of an inch, which, increased in the ratio of 5 to 18, gives the 2556th part of an inch as the measure of the diameter of the globules of blood, agreeing almost exactly with the recent measure of Mr Bauer.

Microscope, from μικgος, a small object, and ακοτrεω, to see or examine, is the name of a well-known optical instrument for examining and magnifying minute objects, or the minute parts of large ones. Dr Goring has, in his various ingenious works on the microscope, used the word engiscope, from εγγυς, near, and σκοπεω, to see ; but the old and venerable term is so associated with the history of optical discovery, and is so expressive of the application of the instrument, that we cannot consent to the proposed change.

As the early history of the microscope must form a part of the general history of Optics, we must refer our readers to that article for an account of its invention and progressive improvements, as well as for an account of the optical principles on which it depends.

There is probably no branch of practical science which has undergone such essential and rapid improvements as that which relates to the microscope. It has become quite a new instrument in modern times, and it promises to be the means of disclosing the structure and laws of matter, and of making as important discoveries in the infinitely minute world, as the telescope has done in that which is infinitely distant.

CHAP. I.—ON SINGLE MICROSCOPES.

A single microscope is one in which only one convex lens is used for magnifying objects. The object to be examined is placed before the lens,∙in its focus; and the rays which emerge from the lens after refraction are parallel, and therefore give distinct vision of the object to the eye placed behind it. The simplest form of the single microscope is when the lens is fitted into a rim of brass furnished with a handle, and the object being held in the left hand and the lens in the right, it may be examined with great correctness. If the convex lens is very minute, and has a short focal length, such as from the 10th to the 100 th of an inch, it cannot be conveniently used in the hand, and must therefore be placed in a firm microscope stand, having a shelf for holding the object, a screw or a rack and pinion for placing the object in the focus of the lens, and a lens or mirror, or both, for throwing light upon the object. In this form, however complex be its structure, it is still called a single microscope.

A single microscope, in order to have all the perfection which art can give, must consist of a substance perfectly homogeneous, like a fluid without double refraction, or any variation of density. Its figure ought to be that of a planoconvex lens, whose convex surface is part of a hyperboloid, in order to correct completely the spherical aberration. Its surface should be perfectly smooth and highly polished, so as not to disturb the perfection of vision; and the substance of which it is made should have the lowest dispersive power. As it is a great object to obtain high magnifying powers with as little convexity as possible, and a large aperture, substances with high refractive and low dispersive ones are the most suitable for single lenses, such as diamond, garnet, or which have no double refraction when well crystallized; or such as ruby, sapphire, topaz, &c. which have double refraction. As fluor spar has the lowest dispersive power, it might be used with great advantage when high powers are not wanted, and when the diminution of colour is an object.

Of all the substances we have named, fluids have properties best suited for single microscopes. They possess perfect homogeneity, their surfaces when made into lenses are perfectly smooth, and it is possible to mould minute drops of them into a form approaching to that of the hyperboloid. Their defect, however, consists in their not having a high refractive power, in their want of durability, and the difficulty of forming sufficiently minute lenses for producing high magnifying powers. These defects, however, especially the last, may be overcome by patience and experience; and in proof of this we may state, that we [7:15:28] have succeeded in forming fluid lenses that were fully equal to the best sapphire lenses that have been executed.

In the present state of this branch of science, it would be unprofitable to detail the methods of producing microscopic globules of glass, given by Dr Hooke, Father di Torre of Naples, Mr Butterfield, or Mr Sivright; because when they are made after their methods, and in the most perfect manner which the methods will permit, they are of no value compared with lenses of glass when ground and polished to the same focal length.^[34. These methods may be found.by the following references -Hooke’s Micrographia; Di Torre', Phil. Trans. 1765, n. 246, 1766, p. 67; Butterfield, Phil. Trans. 1678; Sivright, Edin. Phil. Journal, 1829, vol. i. p. 81.]

We shall therefore proceed to describe a single microscope when fitted up in the best form for observation.

Description of a Single Microscope.

The most essential part of this instrument is the lens or lenses, upon which the value of the microscope depends. The lenses are generally made of plate-glass, and should have focal distances varying from the 1-10th to the 1-50th of an inch. In order that the spherical aberration of these lenses may be the smallest possible, the radii of their two surfaces should be as 1 to 6; the surface whose radius is as 1, or the most convex side, must be turned towards the eye. The lenses, thus made, are then set in the centre of the lower surface of concave brass caps, a section of one of which is shown in Plate CCCLIX. fig. 1.

The best mode of fitting up the microscope is that contrived by Mr Pritchard, which is represented in fig. 2, on a scale about one third of its real size. It is shown in an inclined position; but it may be used either in a vertical or a horizontal one, according to the convenience of the observer. The body of the instrument rests on a pillar b, supported by three legs, shown at α, and is connected with it by the clip f, being fixed by the pinching screw f. Within the tube c there slides a tube Λ, connected by a screw which passes through it to the triangular tube or bar i, carrying the arm ij, into which is placed the brass cap y which carries the lens. This lens is adjusted to the distinct vision of objects placed on the stage I by sliding the tube h up or down, and a perfect adjustment is obtained by turning the milled head k. The stage I, which carries the objects, is fitted into the triangular box r at the extremity of the stem, by means of two pins, and can be removed at pleasure. The spring slider-holder, for holding the sliders in which the objects are placed, is fixed by a bayonet-joint into the stage; and it may be used to hold stops or diaphragms for limiting the field of view. The tube above f represents an illuminator fixed to the slider-holder. Upon the tube c, two sockets d, e slide with sufficient spring and friction to keep them in their place. The socket d carries the reflector d, and the socket e carries the condensing lens, which is not inserted in the figure.

A section of the stem rck is shown in fig. 3, in order to exhibit the mechanism by which the adjustment is effected. Into the box r, screwed into the top of the stem, is fitted the triangular tube ii', which carries the arm ij. In the lower end i' of this triangular tube is a small block with a fine screw working in it, the stem of which turns along with the milled head k, to which it is fixed. The upper end of a spiral spring, shown in the figure, bears against the block i' at the bottom of the triangular tube, while its lower end acts against a stop fixed within the sliding tube Λ. The method of managing, illuminating, and examining opaque objects with this microscope is the same as that used in the achromatic compound microscope, in the drawing of which it will be more distinctly seen.

The preceding instrument of Mr Pritchard’s is intended for general purposes; but as the dissection of botanical and other objects is now a leading object with naturalists, we shall add an account of another microscope, constructed by Mr A. Ross, with much skill, for Mr W. Valentine of Nottingham, the parts of which are given in considerable detail.

A perspective view of this microscope is shown in Plate CCCLIX. fig. 4. It is supported on a closing tripod, aaa, whose feet can be folded together, and are made of hard bell-metal, prevented from springing by edge bars, as seen on the left-hand foot. A firm pillar, which rises from the tripod, carries the stage x, which is fixed on brackets, to give a steady support to the hands of the operator. A capital, e, fixed to the top of the tube by three screws, has in its axis a triangular hole, into which is fitted the triangular tube/ the lower end of which passes through another similar triangular tube in the piece gg, fixed to the tube. This triangular tube is made to slide up and down by a fixed screw, i, which is wrought by a large milled head, o, which is most judiciously placed at the base of the pillar. At the top and bottom of the triangular tube, at g and near r, are fitted two pieces, with triangular holes through them for receiving the triangular bell-metal bar ss, which moves up and down in them. This bar carries the arm 10 with the lenses. It is moved up and down, so as to adjust the lenses to distinct vision of the objects on the fixed stage, by the rack and pinion t, when a quick adjustment is required; but when a slow and nicer adjustment is wanted, it is effected by the milled head o. A slit, uv, is made in the shaft of the pillar, to allow the neck of the small milled head t to move up and down; for when the screw is in action by the large milled head o, the triangular tube and the bar move together. The triangular bar is perforated at both ends, the upper perforation for receiving a conical pin, and the lower for admitting the adjusting screw to preserve the length of the bar. The piece w is removed from the side of the pillar, to show the beàrings of the pinion t, which are attached to the triangular tube. The bar moves 1½ inch, and the tube 1½, so that we can command an elevation of 3 inches. At the ingenious suggestion of Mr Solly, the screw i, moved by the milled head o, has fifty threads in an inch, and the milled head is graduated into 100 parts, for the purpose of measuring the thickness of any vessel or other object in the direction of the axis of vision. For this purpose the upper surface of the body is brought into distinct vision; the division at which the index or pin of the tripod stands is then observed; and the under surface being in like manner brought into focus by turning the milled head o, the division is again observed. The number of divisions, which are each 5000ths of an inch, between these two numbers, will indicate, according to Mr Valentine, the space through which the lens has passed, which is the diameter of a vessel. ^[35. % This is not the case, as the refraction of the light issuing from the lower side of the vessel or object is not considered. The right mode is, after having observed the upper surface of an object lying upon glass, remove the object, and observe the divisions when the surface of the glass is seen distinctly: the difference will be the true thickness. Mr Samuel Varley is said to have constructed an instrument on this principle for measuring the thickness of foci of lenses; but unless he removed his lens after observing the first surface, his results must have been all erroneous.]

In this microscope, different parts of an object may be brought into the field, either by moving the stage or the [7:15:29] lens, a very important requisite in a microscope used for the purposes of discovery. With this view, the large stage x is formed of three plates, the lowest of which is fixed to the pillar by the ring 1; and,.to make it bear the weight of the hands, it rests upon the strong brackets 2, 2. The under side of this plate is shown in fig. 6; the middle plate, fig. 7, contains two pair of dovetail slits, 3, 3 and 4, 4, the widest orifice of each being on opposite sides of the plate. The dovetail pieces in 4, 4 screw into the upper side of the upper plate, fig. 8, the points of the screws being shown at 4. 4 in that figure, while the dovetail pieces in 3, 3 are secured to the upper side of the under plate by the screws 3, 3, fig. 3. The plates are thus moved diagonally, and at right angles to one another, by the adjusting screws 7 and 8. One of the screws, with its ball and milled head, is shown in fig. 9. In the adjusting screw 7, the ball is placed in spring couplings, and fastened to the under side of the upper plate. These screws are judiciously placed, one on each side of the pillar, that the hand may reach them easily and not intercept the light. By turning first one screw, and then the other, or both at once, any part of the object may be brought into the field.

The arm for holding the lenses is shown at 10, in fig. 1 and fig. 10. A conical pin projects from underneath, and fits into a hole made down the triangular bar, as shown at 9, fig. 8. The lens will therefore have a circular movement in a horizontal plane, and it may be placed at any point in this plane by the action of the rack and pinion at 10. Hence the most complete adjustment can be obtained without any motion of the stage.

The elevated stage for holding the objects is shown at 11 in fig. 4 and 8. A tube, 12, fig. 11, screws into the upper plate, and upon this fits the tube 11, carrying the finger spring, shown in fig. 4. Objects of different thickness are thus kept down upon the plates by the pins sliding in the small pipes. An elevated stage is shown in fig. 12, for viewing the sides of objects without disturbing them. A condensing lens, fig. 13, slides into the sockets 5 or 6; and fig. 14 shows the pincers, to be applied in the same manner.

The large reflector above α, fig. 8, may be removed, and any other illuminating apparatus substituted. That of Dr Wollaston is shown in fig. 15, at 19. The handles 18, 18 serve to move the lens up and down in the tube.

The mode of attaching the body of a compound microscope is shown in fig. 16. For this purpose the arm 10, fig. 4, is withdrawn, and the conical pin 20 is made to fit in the same hole in the triangular bar.

Mr Valentine informs us, that with this instrument he can dissect under a lens ^>θth of an inch focus.

As the stand and apparatus now described may be used along with all single microscopes, and also with what are called doublets and triplets, we shall now proceed to give an account of the various improvements which the single microscope has undergone.

Single Microscopes made of Precious Stones.

The low refractive power of glass rendered it necessary, when high powers were wanted, to use lenses with very short foci, and consequently with very deep curves and very small diameters, so as to admit only a narrow pencil of light into the eye.

Sir David Brewster was the first person who pointed out the value of using other materials for the construction of lenses; and he remarked, that no essential improvement could be expected in the single microscope, unless from the discovery of some transparent substance, which, like the diamond, combines a high refractive with a low dispersive power. Having experienced the greatest difficulty in getting a small diamond cut into a prism in London, he did not conceive it' practicable to grind and polish a diamond lens,^[36. Mr Pritchard informs us (see Edinburgh Journal of Science, No. 1, new series, p. 149, July 1829), that Messrs Rundell and Bridge of Ludgate Hill had, at the time when Mr Pritchard began his experiments, many Dutch diamond-cutters at work; and that the foreman, Mr Levi, with all his men, assured him, that it was impossible to work diamonds into spherical lenses. The same opinion, he adds, was also expressed by several others, who were considered of standard authority in such matters. When Mr Pritchard had, contrary to the expectation of many, succeeded in finishing his first lens, it was examined by Mr Levi, who expressed great astonishment at it, and added, that he was not acquainted with any means by which that figure could have been effected.] and therefore did not put his opinion to the test of experiment. He got two lenses, however, executed in Edinburgh by Mr Peter Hill, an ingenious optician, the one made of ruby, and the other of garnet; and these lenses he found to be greatly superior to any lenses that he had previously used.

Dr Goring, whose zeal and success in the improvement of microscopes has not been surpassed, directed the attention of Mr Pritchard in 1824 to the passages in Sir David Brewster’s Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments, respecting the value of the precious stones for single microscopes; and having immediately seen their full force, it was agreed that they should undertake to grind a diamond into a magnifier.

Diamond Lenses.

The history of this attempt is so interesting, that we must give it in Mr Pritchard’s own words :—“For this purpose,” says he, “Dr Goring forwarded me a small brilliant diamond to begin upon; and it was proposed to give it the curves that in glass would produce a lens of a twentieth of an inch focus, with the proportion of the radii of their surfaces as two to five. This stone I ground with the proper curves, and polished the flatter side, contrary to the expectations of many whose judgment in these matters was thought of much weight, who predicted that the crystalline structure of the diamond would not permit it to receive a spherical figure. When thus far advanced, fate decreed that I should lose the stone, and my only consolation was, to discover afterwards, that had it been completed, its thickness and enormous refractive power would probably have caused the focus to fall within the substance of the stone.

“Having, however, in this experiment proved the possibility of working lenses of adamant, I set about another, and selected a rose-cut diamond, in order to form it into a plano-convex lens, and thereby save a moiety of the labour.

“In the progress of working this stone, the heat generated by friction, in the course of the abrasion of the diamond, was perpetually melting the cement (shell-lac) by which the flat side was affixed to the tool, and compelled me to seek some means by which it might be prevented. After several trials, I found, that when a portion of finely powdered pumice-stone was mixed with the shell-lac, the cement was much stronger, and less liable to melt, than any other similar substance.

“On thefirst of December 18241 had the pleasure of first looking through a diamond microscope, and it was doubtless the first time this precious gem had been employed in making manifest the hidden secrets of nature. A few days after, I had polished it sufficiently to put it into the hands of Dr Goring, who tried its performance on various objects, both as a single microscope and as the objective of a compound. He states in a letter addressed to me, dated 3d [7:15:30] January 1825, ’ that it has shown the most difficult transparent objects I have submitted to it ;’ and again, ‘ I can clearly perceive the amazing superiority it will possess when completely finished.’ I must, however, inform my readers, that we discovered in this state various flaws in the stone, in consequence of which we abandoned all thought of completing it. In this condition the project remained for about a year, when I determined to resume my attempts; and having worked several stones into lenses, I at last succeeded in obtaining a perfect one. In the course of these labours, a new though not unexpected defect appeared in several lenses, which would have subverted the whole scheme, had not the first diamond lens been free from it.

“These lenses, instead of giving a single image like the first, gave a double or triple one. This rendered them utterly useless as magnifiers, and made the defects of soft and hard parts in the same stone, and the small cavities in others, of comparatively trifling consequence. The images exhibited in such lenses overlapped each other, but were never entirely separated, though the quantity of overlapping varied in different specimens.

“It was now evident that these defects arose from polarisation, though this stone is described as i refracting single.’ I subsequently learned from Dr Brewster, after I had overcome these obstacles, that this property of the diamond had been observed by him, and an account of it given in the Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions.^[37. Λ S n k urg S Ph·?' τ i a ∙ ns i , √J°' vi ∙ ii ' p '∖. 181 7∙ See also Geological Transactions, new series, vol. iii. p . 455; and London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine, vol. vn. p. 245.] On referring to his paper, it appears Dr Brewster found that some stones ‘ polarised in particular parts, while other portions of the same stone were quite free from any trace of polarity,' and thus perfectly adapted to our purpose, as had previously been demonstrated in the first diamond lens.

“Notwithstanding these difficulties, and the consequent expense and labour they entailed on me before sufficiently experienced in working upon this refractory material with certainty, I have, now the satisfaction of being able, by inspection a priori, to decide whether a diamond is fit for a magnifier or not; and have now executed two planoconvex magnifiers of adamant, whose structure is quite perfect for microscopic purposes. One of these is about the twentieth of an inch focus, and is now in the possession of his Grace the Duke of Buckingham; the other, in my hands, is the thirtieth of an inch focus, and has consequently amplification enough for most practical purposes.”^[38. Microscopic Cabinet, p. 107-111.]

As the expense of the diamond, and the labour of working it, are very great, about fifty or sixty hours being necessary to complete a diamond lens with double convexity, it is of the greatest consequence to ascertain beforehand if the substance of the diamond is homogeneous, that is, free from difference of density or double refraction, and if it does not contain any small cavities. The best way is to examine the stone, by cutting two flat faces upon it, unless it is a laske or table diamond, which always has two flat faces upon it; but this labour may often be avoided by examining it when plunged or held in a glass trough containing oil of cassia, the fluid which approaches nearest to it in refractive power. This will diminish all the refractions at the irregular surface of the diamond, and make any internal imperfections as easily seen as if its substance was plate-glass.

By comparing the indices of refraction of diamond and glass, it may be easily shown that the same magnifying power may be obtained with a diamond lens having its curvature with a radius of 8, as with a glass lens, the radius of whose curvature is 3; and as the spherical aberration increases with the depth of curvature or the thickness of the lens, a lens of diamond will bear a much larger aperture than one of glass before indistinctness of vision is produced. Mr Pritchard has given a very useful ocular representation of the relative value of a diamond and a glass lens. In the annexed figure, G is the section of a semi-lens of glass, and D the section of one of dia mond, so placed that their principal focus F shall be at the same point. In the diamond semi-lens the marginal rays will intersect the axis at d, and in the glass semi-lens at g; the longitudinal aberration being <7F in the diamond, and gF in the glass lens.

In order to obtain a numerical increase of these aberrations, Mr Pritchard computed them from the formula, and found that of the diamond lens to be ^ths of its own thickness, that of the glass lens being½ths of its thickness; and by taking the thickness of the diamond lens to be 255, while that of the glass is 758, he obtained ⅞ths of 255= 108, and ½ths of 758 = 884, and hence it follows that the actual aberration of a diamond lens is only about one ninth of the aberration of a glass lens of the same power and aperture.

If we suppose the diamond lens to be ground on the same tool with the glass lens, so as to have the same curvature, the same thickness, and the same diameter, the longitudinal aberration of the diamond will be to that of the glass lens as 43 is to 117, or nearly one third of it; and if we suppose the focal length of both to be⅛th of an inch, the magnifying power of the diamond lens will be 2133, while that of the glass one will be only 800. In order that a lens of glass may have the same magnifying power as that of the diamond above mentioned, its focal distance would require to be only the 200th part of an inch.

The durability of the diamond lens is also another valuable property, which allows it to be burnished into a disc of metal, and taken out and cleaned without any danger of being scratched. In treating of microscopic doublets and achromatic microscopes, we shall have occasion to recur again to the diamond lens.

Sapphire Lenses.

The ruby and the sapphire are the same substance, differing only in colour. Mr Pritchard has, with his usual success, executed many lenses of sapphire, which, though inferior to those of diamond, are vastly superior to the best executed lenses of glass. When a double convex lens of sapphire and one of plate-glass are ground to the same focus, so as to have the same aperture and magnifying power, their relative curvatures are as 5 to 3, and their thicknesses as shown in the annexed figure, where A is the section of a semi-lens of sapphire, whose focus is at F, and B a section of a semilens of glass, having its focus at the same point. This figure points out in the clearest manner another advantage of using the precious stones in place of glass. In small lenses of glass, the thickness of the glass is such that there is no room between its anterior surface and the object for the admission of instruments for dissection, and not [7:15:31] even for the thinnest plate of glass, so that it is impossible to use glass lenses of small foci in viewing objects placed in glass sliders. If the preceding figure represents lenses with a focus of ⅛th of an inch, the distance of the glass lens B from F will be little more than π 1 θth of an inch, which is less than the thinnest glass.

In using the Sapphire and ruby, or any precious stone which refracts doubly, such as zircon, topaz, &c. for lenses, we are exposed to a very serious defect, arising from the duplication of minute lines, in consequence of the double refraction of these crystals. In order to remedy this defect, the optician endeavours to cut the stone so that the axis of the lens may coincide with the axis of double refraction. This, howevêr, is a difficult task; and, even if it were accomplished, we should not get rid entirely of the duplication of the images, as in all double convex lenses, as well as in plane convex lenses with the plane side turned to the object, the rays cannot pass through the lens in parallel directions, and therefore must suffer double refraction, however small. It may be reduced, however, to the smallest possible amount, and even to nothing, for pencils of rays diverging from a point in the axis, by making the lens plano-convex, and turning the plane side to the eye, as in the annexed figure, where rays issuing from F, and entering the eye parallel at E, must pass through the lens AB in parallel directions, suffering all their refraction at the first or curved surface of the lens. By adopting this form and position of the lens, we, however, lose more than we gain; for the lens is placed in the position which gives a maximum spherical aberration. When the magnifying power is not very high, the residual double refraction is not injurious; and in proof of this we may state, that we have in our possession a double convex lens of sapphire, executed by Mr Pritchard, which exhibits minute objects with the greatest beauty and precision. The only way, therefore, is to employ precious stones, such as the diamond, the garnet, and the spinelle ruby, which have no double refraction when their crystallization has been regularly effected.

Garnet and Spinelle Ruby Lenses.

The garnet is superior in its structure to the spinelle ruby, and the best and purest which we have seen is that which is brought from Greenland, and has a slight tinge of purple. We have used lenses made of this substance by Mr Hill, Mr Adie, Mr Blackie, and Mr Veitch, all of which exhibit minute objects with admirable accuracy and precision; and we can state with confidence, that we have never experienced the slightest inconvenience from the colour of the garnet, which diminishes with its thickness, and consequently disappears almost wholly in very minute lenses.

Single Fluid Microscopes.

Mr Stephen Gray long ago proposed to construct single microscopes with drops of water, which he lifted up with a pin, and deposited in a small hole made in a piece of brass. The drop retained a sort of imperfect sphericity, and showed objects with some distinctness; but it is obvious that the very weight of the drop destroyed its spherical form, even if it had not been disturbed by minute irregularities on the circumference of the aperture in which it was placed.

Sir David Brewster long ago constructed fluid lenses in a different manner, so as to avoid the irregularities above mentioned. He placed minute drops of very pure turpentine varnish, and other viscid fluids, on plates of thin and parallel glass. By this means he formed plano-convex lenses of any focal length; and by dropping the varnish on both sides, he formed double convex lenses, with their convexities in any required proportion. By freeing the glass carefully from all grease with a solution of soda, the margin of these lenses was beautifully circular; and the only effect of gravity, which diminishes with the viscidity of the fluid and with the smallness of the drop, is to elongate the lower lens and flatten the upper one. These lenses were found to answer well as the object-glasses of compound microscopes.

After experiencing’the extreme difficulty of obtaining precious stones free of double refraction or difference of density, and from little cavities and imperfections, as well as the difficulty of giving their surfaces a perfect polish and a correct figure, Sir David Brewster has, we understand, recently made an extended series of experiments on the formation of minute fluid lenses, which should equal in power and distinctness those made of precious stones. The primary difficulty which was encountered in this attempt was that of depositing a sufficiently minute drop of fluid upon a surface of glass. This arose from two causes, from the difficulty of taking up on the slenderest fibre a minute globule of a fluid of any moderate tenacity, and the still greater difficulty of overcoming its adhesion to the fibre, and laying a portion of it on glass. The first of these difficulties he overcame by a suitable mixture of two fluids, and the second by a mechanical process. Having thus succeeded in obtaining lenses too small to be recognised distinctly by the eye, he next endeavonred.to make their figure approximate to the hyperbolic form when the lenses were not of the smallest size, and the results which he obtained were far beyond his expectation. Some of these lenses preserved their perfection for more than a year, and if protected from dust might have been kept much longer. If fluids could be obtained of a high refractive power, and not of a volatile nature, microscopes of extreme perfection might thus be readily constructed.

Catadioptric Lenses.

A single lens, by which light is both refracted and reflected, seems at first sight to be something paradoxical. Such a lens, however, which was proposed and used by Sir David Brewster, is shown in the annexed figure, where ABC is a hemispherical plano-convex lens, which, if we use it in the common way, will have a certain magnifying power; but if we use it as shown in the figure, it acts as a double convex lens of the same radius, and has consequently twice the magnifying power. Bisect the semicircle BAC in A, and join AB, AC. If we now place an object at rnη, and look into the lens BA at F, we shall see by reflection from the surface BC the object mn, with the same distinctness and under the same angle as if we had placed the two lenses Aα B√, Aα Cd, with their plane sides AB, AC together. Since tRe light is incident on the reflecting surface BDC at an angle of 45°, not a ray of it will be lost, as it suffers total reflection. The lens thus used has less spherical aberration than when used as a whole, ABC, and there is no error from imperfect centring. This lens may be used as the object-glass of a compound microscope; and it will be seen in another [7:15:32] section that it possesses other advantages than those which have been mentioned.

The Grooved Sphere.

This lens derives its name from its having a deep groove cut round it in the plane of a great circle perpendicular to the axis of vision. Sir David Brewster was led to its construction by the doublet of Dr Wollaston, which will be described in another section. It consists of a spherical lens or sphere, with a deep concave groove cut round it, so as to cut off the marginal pencils, and thus give a wider field and a more perfect image. It is represented in the annexed figure, where AB CD is a sphere of glass, having the unshaded parts below AC and above BD cut away, in order to prevent rays that fall very obliquely from reaching the eye. The central thickness of the lens may be made so small as to render the spherical and even the chromatic aberration almost insensible. As all the pencils pass through the centre, every part of the image will be equally distinct; a property possessed by no other lens whatever.

Mr Coddington,^[39. Phil. Trans. 1830, part i. p. 69-84.] who entertains a high opinion of the value of this lens, observes: “Besides all this, another advantage appears in practice to attend this construction, which I did not anticipate, and for which I cannot now at all account. I have stated, that when a pencil of rays is admitted into)the eye, which, having passed without deviation through a lens, is bent by the eye, the vision is never free from the coloured fringes produced by eccentrical dispersion. Now with the sphere I certainly do not perceive this defect, and I therefore conceive that if it were possible to make the spherical glass on a very minute scale, it would be the most perfect simple microscope, except, perhaps, Dr Wollaston’s doublet,^[40. This exception was needless, as the doublet is not a simple microscope, having two lenses placed at a distance. [table]] than which I can hardly imagine any thing more excellent, as far as its use extends, its only defects being the very small field of view, and the impracticability of applying it, except to transparent objects seen by transmitted light. Now the sphere has this advantage, that whereas it makes a very good simple microscope, it is more peculiarly fitted for the object-glass of a compound instrument, since it gives a perfectly distinct image of any required extent, and that, when combined with a proper eye-piece, it may without difficulty be employed for opaque objects.” We do not rightly apprehend the exact import of these observations. Mr Coddington distinctly asserts that the grooved sphere is the most perfect simple microscope, or the most perfect microscope with one lens; and yet he says in the next paragraph that it is only “a very good simple microscope,” being “more peculiarly fitted for a compound instrument.”

With regard to the difficulty of making it on a small scale, it is by no means great; for if we can grind and polish its two surfaces, we may readily excavate it round its margin. We have now before us a grooved sphere of garnet ^⅛th of an inch radius, executed by Mr Blackie: The focus is almost close to the lens, which in many kinds of observation is a great advantage, and its performance is remarkably fine.

It will be seen in our article on Optics, that when the refractive inde*x of a sphere exceeds 2∙000, its focus falls within the sphere. Hence a grooved sphere made of diamond is useless. When made with garnet, it is invaluable, and its focus is just thrown so near its surface, that i the objects may be laid upon its surface, or pressed against it by a concave surface of the same radius.

Crystalline Lenses of Small Fishes.

The crystalline lens of minnows and small. fishes may ( be taken out of the eye in a state of such perfection, that, 1 when used as single microscopes, they give a very perfect < image of minute objects. In such lenses which have an 1 increasing density towards their centre, the spherical aberration is almost wholly corrected. Great care, however, must be taken to make the axis of the lens the axis of vision, to prevent its form from being injðred by pressure against the aperture which holds it. The best way is to make a ring at the end of a piece of wire, having its diameter a little greater than that of the lens. A ring of viscid fluid is then made to line the ring of wire, and the lens is suspended in the ring of fluid, some of the fluid encroaching upon its anterior or posterior surface.

Magnifying Forcer of Single Microscopes.

Having thus described the various kinds of single microscopes, we shall now consider the subject of their magnifying power. When an eye in the prime of life, and neither long nor short sighted, views the minutest object which it can recognise, it will generally place it at the distance of about five inches. When the same object is viewed through a single microscope, the distance at which it is seen is equal to the focal length of the lens; and as the apparent magnitude of objects is inversely as the distances at which they are seen, we have only to divide the distance five inches by the focal length of the lens, in order to know its magnifying power, or its apparent magnitude when seen through the lens.

The following table shows the magnifying power of lenses of all focal lengths, from 5 inches up to the 100th of an inch, and is applicable to all lenses, of whatever substance they are made.
[7:15:33]
[table]

We have already mentioned the advantages which the precious stones have over glass ones, in having a much less spherical aberration. In order that a glass lens may have the least spherical aberration, its radii of curvature must be as one to six, the flattest side being turned to the object; but this is not the case with bodies of a different refractive power. Mr Coddington, in his valuable Treatise on the Reflection and Refraction of Light,^[41. Page 111, Cambridge, 1829.] has computed the ratio of the curves when the aberration is a minimum for various indices of refraction from 1∙5 up to 2O, and the amount of the aberration itself in parts of the thickness of the lens. This table is very important in a practical point of view, as will be seen from the observations which follow it.

Table showing the Spherical Aberration of Lenses of Glass and the Precious Stones, and the proper proportion of their Radii when the Aberration is a Minimum.

It appears from the preceding table, that when the refractive index is between 1∙4 and 1∙6 and a little more, but less than 1∙7, the second surface of the double convex lens must be convex, in order to have the least spherical aberration; but that when the index is above 1 - 6 or a little more, the second surface must be concave, in order to make the aberration a minimum, and this concavity, in the case of zircon and sulphur, is so much as — 5, so that in diamond it must be nearly — 3; so that we must sacrifice a great deal of magnifying power in order to obtain this advantage in diamond; but the sacrifice will be well bestowed, for such a lens will be almost wholly free of spherical aberration. It appears from the table, that when the index of refraction is a little less than l∙7, a plano-convex lens, with its plane side turned to the object, is the best form for a single microscopè.

Notwithstanding the difficulty of the task, we would earnestly direct the attention of artists to the subject of grinding plano-convex lenses of a hyperbolic form for single microscopes. The smallness of a lens must increase the difficulty; but in this case the effect may be accidentally obtained, as it is often done in giving a parabolic and an elliptical form to specula. Mr Potter has given, and put to the test of experiment, a method of obtaining any curve derived from revolution, by giving a particular form to the grinding and polishing tools.^[42. Edinburgh Journal of Science, new series, No. 12.]

CHAP. II.—DESCRIPTION OF MICROSCOPIC DOUBLETS AND TRIPLETS.

Under this chapter we propose to describe all combinations of lenses in which two or more are placed in contact, or at such a distance that no image is formed between them.

Wollaston's Periscopic Doublet.

The earliest proposal of a doublet lens was that which Dr Wollaston described in 1812,^[43. Phil. Trans. 1812, p. 375.] under the name of a periscopic microscope. The following is his own description of it: “The great desideratum,” says he, “in employing high magnifiers, is sufficiency of light; and it is accordingly expedient to make the aperture of the little lens as large as is consistent with distinct vision. But if the object to be viewed is of such magnitude as to appear under an angle of several degrees on each side of the centre, the requisite distinctness cannot be given to the whole surface by a common lens, in consequence of the confusion occasioned by oblique incidence of the lateral rays, excepting by means of a very small aperture, and proportionable dimi nution of light. In order to remedy this inconvenience, I conceived that the perforated metal which limits the aperture of the lens might be placed with advantage in its centre; and accordingly I procured two plano-convex lenses ground to the same radius, and applying their plane surface on opposite sides of the same aperture, in a thin piece of metal (as is represented by a section, fig. 6), I produced the desired effect, having virtually a double convex lens, so contrived that the passage of oblique pencils was at right angles with its surface, as well as the central pencil. With a lens so constructed, the perforation that appeared to give thς most perfect distinctness was about one-fifth part of the focal length in diameter; and when such an aperture is well centred, the visible field is at least as much as 20* in diameter. It is true, that a portion of light is lost by doubling the number of surfaces; but this is more than compensated by the greater aperture which, under these circumstances, is compatible with distinct vision.”

Periscopic Sphere.

In the preceding passage Dr Wollaston describes only a double convex periscopic microscope, consisting of two plano-convex lenses; but he does not take the case where these two lenses are hemispheres, and, consequently, where the doubly convex one which they form is a sphere. When the lenses are not hemispheres, the pencils are not centrical, and the rays from different parts of the object do not each suffer the same species of refraction as they do when passing through a sphere, so that every part of the field is not equally distinct. It is obvious also that Dr Wollaston did not think of filling up the central aperture[7:15:34] with a fluid of the same refractive power as the lens, in order to remove the loss of light from the double number of surfaces, which he mentions as a defect in his microscope.

The construction of a periscopic sphere proposed by Sir David Brewster combines these two properties. The lenses, whether they are hemispherical or not, must be so placed that their convex surfaces form part of the same sphere, as shown in the annexed figures.

In fig. 7, the plano-convex lenses AB, CD may be cemented to a piece of plate glass mn, of such a thickness in one direction as to complete the sphere, and of such a diameter in the direction mu as to form a suitable contraction of the aperture.

In fig. 8, the space between the lenses may be filled up, as in the figure, by two pieces of plate-glass ArønB, C≡D, between which is a plate of brass, or of thin black paper, containing a suitable aperture in the centre of the lenses. Here there are six surfaces within the sphere, but, by uniting them with a proper cement, the whole becomes a single sphere, in which there is no perceptible loss of light.

In fig. 9, lenses of unequal size and thickness are combined, either with a plate of glass, or a fluid between them of the same refractive power as the glass, and the apertures may be placed on the plane surfaces AB, CD.

In fig. 10, two convex lenses may be combined into a sphere, the intermediate portion being filled up with a fluid of the same refractive power. This may be readily done by cementing each lens on the end of a brass or glass tube ab, and introducing the fluid by an aperture.

In uniting these lenses, it is obviously necessary that the convex outer surfaces should be exactly of the same curvature, and of the same kind of glass. The best way of effecting this is to grind a thick lens ABC, either greater or less than a hemisphere, and then to bisect it at AD, and out of the portions ADB, ADC to form two plano-convex or two double convex lenses AB, CD. The outer surfaces of these two lenses will belong accurately to the same sphere. The perfect similarity of the inner surfaces is of less consequence, as all refraction by them is removed by the cement.

By these different steps Sir David Brewster was led to the idea of the grooved sphere, or the lens already described under the head of single microscopes, in which the aperture is contracted by excavating the sphere all round in one of its great circles.

Periscopic Achromatic Spheres.

If, in the construction shown in fig. 12, in place of making the fluid op of the same refractive and dispersive power as the two lenses, we make it such as to correct the colour of these lenses, we shall obtain an achromatic sphere, as proposed by Sir David Brewster; and the compound lens may be still farther improved as a microscope, by attaching, either by cement or not to the back of the first lens AB, a convex speculum of silver or steel for illuminating the object, the contracted aperture being the hole in the centre of the speculum. The concave fluid lens is shown at op ; and such a curvature must be given to the convex reflector mn, that it may reflect parallel or diverging rays upon the object·^[44. Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, vol. iii.; and Mr Pritchard’s Treatise on Optical Instruments, in the Library of Useful Knowledge, p. 41, § 66.]

Mr Coddington,^[45. Treatise on the Reflection and Refraction of Light, p. 256.] in his excellent treatise on optics, thus treats of the preceding contrivance.

“An achromatic sphere may be constructed by interposing between two crossed lenses (double convex ones), in opposite positions, a concave lens of a medium more highly dispersive than that of the lenses, adjusting the curvatures so that the outer surfaces of the crossed lenses shall be portions of the same sphere, and that the interior surfaces shall exactly fit into each other.

“In such a system, we may consider the effect to be the same as that of an entire sphere of the same medium as the two lenses diminished by that of a concave lens having for its refractive ratio that which exists between the two media in question.

“Thus, if μ 1 be the ordinary index of refraction for the convex lenses, ,α 2 for the concave one, v : 1 the ratio of the dispersive powers, r the radius of the sphere, s, e those of the internal surfaces, we must have

(⅛-l) + 1 = cl i

If the first internal surface be plane, or s = co, we have in general σ = or, ae this particular exam ple, σ = l,2r, or σ : r = 6: 5.”

Doublet of no Aberration.

So long ago as 1668, a doublet was described in the Philosophical Transactions, in which a large and flat field was obtained. This subject, however, was never investigated with care till Sir John Herschel took up the subject in 1821. The doublet, made of glass, which Sir John proposes for obtaining perfect distinctness in microscopical[7:15:35] observations is shown in the annexed figures, 13, 14, the convex sides being turned to the eye when the doublet is used as a microscope, and to the sun when it is used as a burning-glass. The following are the radii and focal length of these lenses.
[table]

“Whether we ought or ought not,’’ says Sir John, “to aim at the rigorous destruction of rays parallel to the axis, the use to which the lens is to be applied must decide. In a burning-glass it is of the highest importance. A slight consideration will suffice to show, that the difference of temperatures produced in the foci of a double convex lens of equal radii, and one of the same focal length, but of the best form, must be very considerable. In order to try whether even the latter might not be improved by the shortening of the focus, and the superior concentration of the exterior rays, by applying a correcting lens of one of the forms above calculated, in spite of the loss of heat in passing through a second glass, I procured two lenses to be figured to the radii assigned in the first column of the foregoing table. They were about three inches in aperture, and when combined as above described, the aberration was almost totally destroyed, and probably would have been so completely had the index of refraction proper to the glass been employed instead of that adopted in our calculation for brevity. Their combined effect as a burning-lens appeared to me decidedly superior to that of the first lens used alone, and there is therefore good reason to presume, that the effect of the other construction, which, with the same loss of heat, affords a much greater contraction of the focus, would be still better; and I regret not having tried it in preference.

“In eye-glasses and magnifiers, if we would examine a minute object with much attention, as a small insect, or (when applied to astronomical purposes) if we would scrutinize the appearance of a planet, a lunar mountain, the nucleus of a comet, or a close double star, where extent of field is of less consequence than perfect distinctness in the central point, too muçh pains cannot be taken in destroying the central aberration.”^[46. Phil. Trans. 1821, p. 246-248.]

Mr Pritchard informs us, that he has executed some of these doublets for the object-glasses of compound microscopes, “for which,” he says, “they answer remarkably well, but their angle of aperture is small compared with combinations of double achromatics.”^[47. Microscopic Cabinet, p. 163.] Heτschel ’ s Periscopic Doublet.

We owe also to Sir John Herschel the construction of a periscopic doublet with a very large field of moderate distinctness. “In spectacles,” says he, “reading-glasses, magnifiers of moderate power, and eye-glasses for certain astronomical purposes, the correction of the aberration in the centre of the field may be sacrificed with little inconvenience. By far the best periscopic combination I am acquainted with consists of a double convex lens of the best form, but placed in its worst position (radii as 6 to 1) for the lens next the eye, and a plane concave whose focal length is to that of the other as 2∙6 to 1, or as 13 to 5, placed in contact with its flatter surface, and having its concavity towards the object, as in the annexed figure, for the farthest; yet for destroying the aberration of rays parallel to the axis nothing can be worse.

In fact our formula gives for the aberration in this construction 22∙02, or about 22 times what the best single lens of equal power would give; yet, on accidentally combining two such lenses in this manner, I was immediately struck with the remarkable extent of oblique vision, with the absence of fatigue on reading some lines with a power much beyond that of the natural eye, and with the freedom from colour at the edges of the field, arising from the opposition of the prismatic refractions of the two solids, an advantage which a single meniscus does not possess.” The focal length of the compound lens which Sir John tried was 1 ’ 84 of an inch. The field of tolerably distinct vision extended fully 40° from the axis, and the letters of a book might be read, and the forms of objects distinguished, with management, as far as the 75th degree. In using such a combination the lenses should be very thin, and the eye applied as close as possible.

Plano-Convex Doublet.

A doublet of much simpler construction, and withits spherical aberration greatly diminished, has also been proposed by Sir John Herschel. It is represented in the annexed figure, and consists of. two convex lenses of equal focal lengths, the convex sides being placed in contact, and the eye and object opposite the plane sides. In this case the aberration will be only 0∙6028. But if we make the focal length of the first to that of the second as 1 to 2∙3, the aberration will be reduced to 0 ’ 2481. In order to have an idea of the value of such a doublet, we shall give the series of aberrations for single lenses, as investigated by Sir John Herschel.
[table]

As these calculations are made for glass, the advantage of such a doublet made of garnet or sapphire must be much greater. In a garnet the minimum aberration takes place when the form of the lens differs very little from that of plano-convex; and as it is then to that of glass as 35 to 107, the aberration will be only about 0 - 08, or next to imperceptible.

Wollaston s Doublet.

The consideration of the Huygenian eye-piece for astronomical telescopes suggested to Dr Wollaston the probability that a similar combination should have a similar [7:15:36] advantage, of correcting both achromatic and spherical aberrations, if employed in an opposite direction as a microscope.^[48. Mr Coddington has shown that such a correction is impossible. (Treatise on the Eye and Optical Instruments, p. 55.)] With this view, he took two plano-convex lenses, the ratio of whose focal lengths was as 3 to 1, and he placed them as in the annexed figure, so that the distance of their plane surfaces was from 1 τ 4 σ to of the focal length of the smallest. The plane sides of the lenses are towards the object.

The advantage of the first lens having its plane side next the object is, as Dr Wollaston states, that if it should touch a fluid, the view is not only not impaired, but improved, whereas a double convex lens would require to be taken out and cleaned. The following excellent observations on this doublet are made by Pritchard.

s “Having mounted some plano-convex lenses of the relative foci named by Dr Wollaston, in such a manner that the distances might be varied at pleasure, I was surprised to find, that after the doublet was adjusted by trial, so as to obtain the maximum of distinctness, the distance between the lenses did not accord either with the rule given by Huygens,or that of Dr Wollaston. Supposing that I had not got the combination intended by Dr Wollaston, I procured several doublets made by different artists, and to my astonishment found they agreed with my own, and therefore presumed the doctor was mistaken in the distance by the thickness of the lenses and the minuteness of the space between them. The distance which appeared to me essential to obtain the best effect, is the difference of the focal length of the two lenses, making a proper allowance for their thickness. The proportion of the foci of the two lenses may be varied ad libitum. All that is requisite in this respect is, that the difference must be greater than the thickness of the anterior lens, while it may be observed (in high powers), that the greater the difference between their two focal lengths, the more space will be left in front; and as this is of great practical importance, they should never be less than as 1 to 3. I have made some very good ones, differing as much as 1 to 6. Another advantage resulting from attending to this point is, that we do not lose so much magnifying power in such combinations as when the difference between the lenses is less.

“The delicacy and beauty with which these doublets exhibit the structure of tissues will justify my entering into some minute details respecting them. The following is necessary to ensure their goodness.

“ First, The convex surface of each lens must be truly spherical. If this is not obtained, it will be in vain to procure a good doublet, however beautifully the lenses may be polished, or accurately adjusted. From this circumstance, I have found globules perform very well, providing they are free from air-bubbles, which, however, is rarely the case. It should be observed, that a slight scratch on their surface is trifling compared to air-bubbles; for the latter not only stop the light, but, by the reflection around the edges of each bubble, produce considerable fog or glare. Second, The distance between the lenses is the next point of importance; its adjustment is best accomplished by trial, mounting the lenses in such a manner that their distance can be varied at pleasure, and capable of being turned round, so as to adjust the centring. When this is obtained, they should be fixed so that their distance and position cannot be altered. This it is necessary to regard, as I have sometimes spent whole days in re-adjusting a doublet that had been separated to examine the lenses singly. Third, The stop or diaphragm, for limiting the aperture in these combinations, should be placed immediately behind the anterior lens. From the difference of the situation of this stop in the various doublets I have examined, it will appear that their makers did not know that the field of view depended upon the plane of the stop. I have found, that when the stop is situated close behind the anterior lens, no other is required, and the field is enlarged without sensibly augmenting the aberration. On this account, the lenses of the finest doublet, when used singly with the same aperture as combined, has so much aberration and distortion that distinct vision cannot be obtained, even with the most rigid adjustment of the focus. From the difficulty of procuring a flat surface, some makers have worked the anterior surface of the lens next the object concave: these lenses do not possess any advantage in point of performance, not even to compensate for the loss of power from the negative side.”

Mr Pritchard remarks, that when the lens next the object is a jewel, the performance of the doublet is improved; but that he has not observed any advantage when both lenses are gems. This must be a mistake; for lenses of any gem, that are superior to glass ones when acting singly, must, if suitably combined, be superior also when united. In proof of this, we have a garnet doublet before us, executed by Mr Blackie, the performance of which, is quite remarkable. The lenses are made of Elie garnets, and their convex sides are placed towards each other. The radius of the smallest lens near the object is 7 ⅛th {one seventieth} of an inch, and that of the other g⅛th {one twentieth} of an inch. Its magnifying power is very high, exceeding greatly that of the semi-jewel doublet made by Mr Pritchard, with a sapphire lens ∙ s ⅛th {one sixtieth} of an inch focus, combined with a glass lens -∣⅜th {one tenth} of an inch focus.

In the experiments to which we have already referred on fluid lenses, Sir David Brewster has constructed doublets, one of the lenses of which is made of glass or a precious stone, and the other a fluid one, and he has been enabled to increase the power of any single lens by the addition of a fluid one, till the object touches the anterior surface of the object-lens. He has also made fluid spheres contracted in the middle, and fluid doublets in which the centring is effected by an infallible process.

Pritchard 's Triplet.

Upon the same principle as the doublets, Mr Pritchard has constructed triplets, the third or posterior lens having a longer focal length than the two others. This combination requires much more precision in the adjustment, and more attention in the centring. Mr Pritchard remarks, that, “when perfected, they amply repay the pains bestowed upon them, in the accuracy with which they exhibit the most difficult lined objects, though it is to be regretted that neither these nor the doublets of deep power will show pleasantly cylindrical bodies of large diameter, such as a large mouse or bat’s hair.” Having long made use of one of Mr Pritchard’s triplets, we can amply confirm the account which he has given of the excellence of this combination. MrBlackiehas executed for us a triplet, the centre lens of which is garnet, the posterior one of quartz, and the anterior one of flat glass. It is a very powerful combination, and performs admirably.

Sir David Brewster has made triplets in which two of the lenses are fluids and the third a solid, and some inwhich they are all fluids.

Single Achromatic Microscope.

In many of the doublets which we have already described, the chromatic aberration is partially, and sometimes greatly corrected, but still not to such a degree as to entitle[7:15:37] them to the name of achromatic. The great improvement which has taken place in the art of grindino∙ and polishing small lenses, has enabled the optician to execute double and triple achromatic lenses, having a diameter so small as from ½th to τ 1 5 -th of an inch. Mr Pritchard has made them of the latter size with an angle of aperture of 65°. These lenses may be advantageously used where very high powers are not required, or when they cannot be applied, though it is usual to employ them as the object-glasses of compound microscopes, as we shall afterwards see.

Sir David Brewster has executed achromatic lenses both double and triple, by combining a fluid concave lens with one or two convex lenses of the precious stones or glass. When the lenses are double, the fluid lens is of course a meniscus in which the concavity predominates, as it is impossible to form a fluid lens doubly concave.

Single Reflecting Microscopes.

Single reflecting microscopes are not much in use. They consist of a concave metallic speculum of a short focal length, so that any minute body placed in its focus will be seen magnified. The form of the speculum should of course be parabolic. Such a microscope is principally useful for looking at one’s own eye, or any part of it not far from the pupil. In these cases no image is formed, as the rays enter the eye parallel.

The following ingenious contrivance for a fluid reflecting microscope we owe to Mr Stephen Gray.^[49. Phil. Trans. 1697, No. 228, p. 539.] Having taken a small globu!e of quicksilver, and dissolved it in a menstruum of 10 parts of water and 1 of nitric acid (aquafortis), he dipped the end of a stick in this solution, and rubbed with it the inner circle of the ring A, so as to give it a mercurial tincture. This ring is made of brass, and is about the 30th of an inch thick, having its mean diameter not exceeding ∣-ths of an inch. When the inner surface of the ring wetted with the solution has been wiped dry and laid upon a table, pour a drop of quicksilver within it, and when this drop is gently pressed with the ball of the finger, it will adhere to the ring, and when cleansed with a hare’s foot will form a convex speculum. If the ring and speculum arc now taken up and carried horizontally, and laid on the margin of the hollow cylinder B, the mercury will become a concave reflecting speculum, in consequence of its upper surface sinking down by gravity. The cylinder B rests upon a pillar with a screw on its outside, and supported by the base D. A stage, ECFG, may be moved up and down, so as to place the object, which is fixed at G, in the focus of the concave speculum.

CHAP. II.—ON COMPOUND MICROSCOPES.

A compound microscope is an instrument in which a distinct and enlarged image of an object is formed by an object-glass or a speculum, and this enlarged image again magnified by one or more eye-glasses.

There is every reason to believe, that the earliest compound microscopes, which were used by Jansen and Galileo, consisted of a convex lens for an object-glass, and a concave one for an eye-glass, like the telescope which was at that time in use.

Fontana in 1646 used two convex lenses; Dr Hooke three, and Eustachio Divini four; the'two next the eye being plano-convex, and placed in contact, with their convex sides towards each other, to give a high power and a large and flat field. In 1691 Philip Bonnani^[50. Observatione» drca viventia, quoe in rebus non viventibus reperιuntur.] used a compound microscope with three lenses, and added to it an illuminating apparatus with two lenses.'

The reflecting compound microscope was first suggested by Sir Isaac Newton, and its construction varied and made more complex by Dr Barker and Dr Smith of Cambridge. The simple contrivance of Sir Isaac has in modern times been greatly improved by Amici, Potter, Tulley, Cuthbert, and Dr Goring, whose labours in improving the microscope have been indefatigable, arid in the highest degree successful. An account of these improvements will be given in this chapter.

Compound Refracting Microscope.

The principle of the compound microscope with two lenses will be understood from the annexed figure, where MN is a minute object placed in the focus of the objectglass AB, or rather a little farther from it than its principal focus. An image of this objectwill be formed atwm, at some distance behind AB, the distance nA increasing as AM diminishes. The size of the image mn will be to that of the object MN as ?zA is to AM, their distances from the lens AB. If we now view this magnified image rnn through an eye-glass EF, so placed that rnn is in its principal focus, we shall again magnify it in the inverse proportion of En to the distance at which the eye secs minute objects most distinctly, which is about five inches. The object MN is thus doubly magnified, so that if nA is six times AM, and the lens EF has a focal length of half an inch, the magnifying power will be 6 × 5 -÷- ½ s≡ 60. While the lenses are the same, the magnifying power may be increased to any extent by increasing the distance between the lenses EF and AB, but the object becomes indistinct as the magnifying power increases, so that it is not advisable to make the distance nA more than five, six, or seven inches; or callingy the focal distance of the eye-glass, D = AM, d = An, and Δ the distance at which we see objects distinctly, then this magnifying power Μ will be Μ = -^∙ × -y. i , J ⅛

In this arrangement of lenses the field of view is small, and therefore we cannot see the whole of many objects at one view. In order to remedy this, a large lens, called the amplifying glass, is placed between the image and the object-glass, as shown in fig. 20, where nm is the image formed by AB alone; but in consequence of the interposition of GH, it is contracted into νμ, and this contracted image is magnified by the eyeglass EF. In order to widen the field still farther, and make it flat, two plano-convex lenses have been placed at E, F, having their convex sides in contact. In order to find the magnifying power when the lens GH is used, we must multiply the magnifying power, as obtained by the preceding[7:15:38] formula, by the quantity-^-, p representing the focal ð 2 length of the lens GH and L = r d — f δ being

ò — P < j the distance between the first and second glasses, and d the distance between the first and third glasses

Dr Goring prefers the following method of finding the magnifying power of these microscopes. Measure the aperture of the object glass and call it a, make AM = f and having measured with a micrometer scale the diameter of the usual pencil of rays before they enter the eye, call it d ; then a ∙.f = d : F, F being the focal length of a single lens having the same power as the compound microscope. But the magnifying power m of a lens F is —. Hence the magnifying power Μ of the compound micro-

scope will be Μ = —.

In accurate investigations with the microscope, the common compound refracting instrument above described is of little use, and has been superseded by better combinations. As it is, however, very serviceable for common purposes, we shall describe one of them of the most convenient and modern construction. This instrument is shown in Plate CCCLX. fig. 19, where the body of the microscope and all its parts are seen. They all slide on a triangular bar S, the sliding pieces having springs on one side. The three lenses within the body of the microscope are shown at EF, GH, AB, as in the last figure. The object MN is placed on a slider attached to the stage PQ. The reflector for illuminating the field is at R, being moved by a Hooke’s universal joint at XX. A condensing lens is placed at C, for increasing the light reflected from the mirror R. The body of the instrument is adjusted to distinct vision of the object MN, by a rack and pinion working a triangular bar at right angles to the bar S. It is often thought preferable to move the stage towards the microscope, rather than the microscope towards the stage; but as the motion of the stage often disturbs animalcules, and may derange the position of inanimate objects, the motion of the body of the microscope has many advantages. When the stage, however, is moveable, it is made to consist of three plates. The upper plate, which carries the sliderholder, is secured with a screw across the middle plate, which middle plate is carried across the lower stage-plate by a similar motion, but in a direction at right angles to the upper plate. By these movements the object can be placed in any position with regard to the axis of the fixed microscope, first by turning the one screw and then the other.

Some attention is requisite in adjusting the apertures of the object-glasses employed. The smaller they are, the less will be the spherical and chromatic aberration of the object-glass, but the less will be the light. When a planoconvex lens about half an inch focus is used, its plane side should be towards the object, and its aperture limited to - 1 1 3 -th of an inch.

A compound microscope is sometimes so constructed that it can be used as a single microscope. This is done by screwing the lower end of the body round the objectglass into a projecting arm at the top of the stand. When the body is unscrewed and removed, a single lens or a doublet or triplet may be screwed into the same place, and the moveable stage, with the slider and object, brought near the single lens, just as if it had been the object-glass of a compound microscope.

Dr Gorings Improvement on the Object-Glass of the Compound Microscope.

When the compound microscope does not require to have a high power, a compound object-glass of two lenses may be advantageously employed. Dr Goring^[51. Quarterly Journal, vol. xvii, p. 202.] has contrived the combination shown in the annexed figure, where A is a plano-convex lens with its flat side next the object, having its focal distance about one half or two thirds that of the piano or double convex lens B. A stop D is placed in the posterior focus of the object-glass A. Mr Pritchard remarks, that when the focal length of A “is not less than half an inch, this combination has been employed with considerable advantage, both as regards distinctness and aperture.”

Mr Coddington s Improvement on the Eye-Glasses of the Compound Microscope.

The improvement suggested by Mr Coddington on the eye-pieces of compound microscopes is shown in Plate CCCLX. fig. 20. The object of the contrivance is to fulfil the condition proposed by Huygens in his excellent telescopic eye-piece, namely, to have the refraction of the pencils divided between the two lenses, and to produce the greatest possible flattening of the field. Mr Coddington found that the most proper form of the lenses was that shown in. the annexed figure, where the two ⅛ye-glasses con sist of a meniscus A next the eye, and a double equi-convex lens B, while the field-glass is composed of two mensicuses C, D. Mr Coddington, however, informs us, that he “found no sensible error arise from the substitution of plano-convex lenses for the meniscus-glasses, which are difficult and expensive to form.” He remarks also, that theory ι indicates “a farther flattening of i the field to be made by separating the eye-glasses a little, which requires the distance of the first eye-glass from the field-glass to be diminished by about half as much but he did not perceive any improvement arising from this alteration in practice, and therefore he does not recommend the change. The object-glass which Mr Coddington uses in this microscope is shown at o, and is the grooved sphere proposed by Sir David Brewster.

In his treatise on the eye and optical instruments, Mr Coddington has proposed a different combination for the eye-glasses and the field or amplifying-glass. Supposing the distance between the object-glass and field-glass tobe 1 inch, and the focal length of the field and eye-glasses 1 inch each, and the distance between the field-glass andnear-est eye-glass 1 inch, he finds the distance of the two eyeglasses to be ½th of an inch. He finds also, “that all indistinctness arising from the oblique refractions will be corrected when the field-glass is convexo-convex, nearly convexo-plane, the first eye-glass convexo-convex^[52. The flattest side next the eye.] (radii as 3: 1), and the second eye-glass a meniscus^[53. The most convex side next the eye.] (radii as 1: Ô).”

Taking another case, he supposes the distance of the object-glass from the field-glass to be 2 inches, and the eye-glasses to be in contact, as in fig. 22, then “it appears that for the achromatism we must have the distance between the field-glass and second eye-glass 1 inch.” [7:15:39] Then the field-glass must be convexo-plane nearly; the first eye-glass equi-convex, and the second eye-glass a meniscus with the radii as 1:5.

Dr Goring, who examined one of the instruments constructed on these principles, states, that both the chromatic and spherical aberration of the objective part was wholly untouched, and that the eye-piece, consisting of four glasses, was achromatic. He adds also, that nothing can surpass the beauty of the field of this microscope for extent of flatness. Now we think that Dr Goring has mistaken Mr Coddington, who never pretended to correct the spherical and chromatic aberration of the object-glass.^[54. Treatise on the Eye and Optical Instruments, p. 58, 59, § 329.] He considers the chromatic and spherical aberration of the grooved sphere, which is the object-glass he uses, as reduced to very small quantities, by leaving only a small channel in its axis for the passage of the rays. Whatever the residual aberration may be, Mr Coddington is not answerable for it, as his object was merely to make the other part of the microscope good, which, according to Dr Goring, he has succeeded in doing.

Compound Achromatic Microscape.

Although the achromatic microscope has only recently come into use as an effective and superior instrument, yet it can scarcely be considered as a new instrument. Every person knew that an achromatic object-glass was most desirable in a compound microscope. So early as 1776 Euler proposed to employ them in compound microscopes; but so late as 1821 Μ. Biot considered their introduction as out of the question, from the impracticability of achromatizing lenses as small as those which the microscope requires.

In 1823 Μ. Selligues and Dr Goring were both occupied with the subject, the former having employed MM. Chevalier, two excellent opticians in Paris, and the latter Mr Tulley, to execute small achromatic object-glasses. It is to Μ. Selligues, however, in so far as we can learn, that we are indebted for the new and happy idea of making the object-glass consist of four achromatic compound lenses, each consisting of two lenses. This idea is the actual source of the superiority of the achromatic microscopes; andin proof of this we may state, that Professor Amici, who had early been following out the old idea of a single achromatic object-glass, abandoned his attempts in 1815, but afterwards successfully resumed them by adopting Μ. Selligues’ plan of the superposition of several object-glasses. In Μ. Selligues’ instrument the focal length of each object-glass was 18 lines, its diameter 6 lines, and its thickness at the centre 6 lines. In that of Amici the focal length of each was about 6 lines, and MM. Chevalier have executed them having only 2 lines in focal length. More recently, however, Mr Pritchard has surpassed all these artists by making them of one sixteenth of an inch in focal length.

From this brief historical detail, we shall proceed to give a more minute account of the lenses executed by these different individuals, for which we are indebted to Mr Jackson Lister, whose able memoir on this subject is, as we shall see, one of the most valuable contributions to the science of the microscope that has for a long time appeared.

The achromatic object-glasses of Μ. Selligues’ microscope made by MM. Chevalier, consisted of a plano-concave lens of flint glass, and a double convex one of crown or plate glass, with their inner curves cemented together by a mixture of mastic and turpentine, to remove the reflection of the interior surfaces, and prevent the introduction of dampness. Four of these lenses, of from 1½ to 1½ of an inch in focal length, were made to screw before each other; so as to be used either all together, or any of them individually, in the usual manner, like the object-glasses of a compound microscope. The aberration of colour was thus corrected in a considerable degree, but the glasses were fixed in their places, with their convex sides towards the object, which is their worst position; and in consequence of this, the spherical aberration was enormous, and was distinctly seen, even with the small aperture to which it was necessary to reduce them.

Notwithstanding this defect, the grand idea of the combination was acquired: and Μ. Chevalier having observed the mistake committed by Μ. Selligues, made them of less focal length, and more achromatic; and turning the concave lens to the object, he produced in 1825 an instrument far above that of Μ. Selligues. His deepest glasses were four tenths of an inch in focal length; and in his first microscope two such compound lenses were combined for his highest power.

The date of Fraunhofer’s achromatic microscopes is not known. Many years ago the writer of this article ordered an achromatic object-glass from Fraunhofer for a large microscope, for the purpose of making a particular class of observations; but at that time he seems not to have made any compound lenses to be combined after the manner of Selligues. Mr Robert Brown^[55. Phil. Trans. 1830, p. 188.] has a series of five such object-glasses, recently obtained from Utz-schneider, whose focal lengths are from 1∙8 to 0∙43 of an inch.

When Professor Amici visited London in 1827, he brought with him some compound object-glasses, which performed very well; and Mr Lister has since learned from him that he has executed a combination of 2∙7 lines in focal length, and 2∙7 lines in aperture, which greatly excels the former.

Among the most successful improvers of the achromatic microscope we must rank Mr Jackson Lister, who has discovered some curious and valuable properties of these lenses that have escaped the notice of the most skilful analysts. Mr Lister has investigated the subject entirely as a matter of observation, and therefore his results are more likely to have a higher practical value.

Mr Lister takes as the basis of a microscopic objectglass two conditions, 1. that the flint glass shall be planoconcave; and, 2. that it shall be joined by some cement to the convex lens. The first condition obviates the risk of error in centring the two curves, and the second diminishes by nearly a half the loss of light from reflection, which is very great at the numerous surfaces of a combination of compound object-glasses.

Now Mr Lister has found that in every such compound lens which he has tried, whether the flint glass was Swiss or English, with a double convex of plate glass, which has been rendered achromatic by the form given to the outer curve of plate glass, the ratio between the refractive and dispersive powers has been such that its figure has been correct for rays issuing from some point in its axis not far from the principal focus on its plane side; and these rays either tend to a conjugate focus within the tube of the microscope, or emerge nearly parallel.

If AB represents such an object-glass, let us suppose that it is free from spherical and achromatic aberration for a ray FDEG radiating from F, then the angle of emergence GEH will be about three times as great as that of incidence FDI. If the radiant point is now made [7:15:40] to approach the lens, the angles of incidence and emergence will approach to equality, and the spherical aberration produced by the two will bear a less proportion to the opposing error of the single correcting curve ABC, and hence in this case the rays will be overcorrected for such a focus.

As F continues to approach the lens, the angle of incidence continuing to increase, it will exceed that of emergence, which has been in the mean time diminishing, so that the spherical aberration produced by the two outer surfaces will recover their original proportion. When F has reached this point F'' (at which the angle of incidence does not exceed that of emergence so much as it had at first come short of it), the rays will again be free from spherical aberration. If F" still comes nearer the lens, or is carried beyond F in the opposite direction, the angle of incidence in the former case, or of emergence in the latter, becomes disproportionately effective, and in either case the aberration exceeds the correction, or the rays are under-corrected. Hence Mr Lister gives the following rule.

t, That in general an achromatic object-glass·, of which the inner surfaces are in contact, or nearly so, will have on one side of it two foci in its axis, for the rays proceeding from which the spherical aberration will be truly corrected at a moderate aperture ; that for the space between these two points, its spherical aberration ινill be over-corrected, and beyond them either way, under-corrected?

Mr Lister found also, “that when the longer aplanatic focus is used, the marginal rays of a pencil not coincident with the axis of the glass are distorted, so that a coma is thrown outwards, while the contrary effect of a coma directed towards the centre of the field is produced by the rays from the shorter focus.” These interesting results obviously furnish the means of destroying both aberrations in a large focal pencil, and of thus surmounting what has been hitherto the chief obstacle to the perfection of the ‘microscope. And when it is considered that the curves of its diminutive object-glasses have required to be at least as exactly proportioned as those of a large telescope, to give the image of a bright point equally sharp and colourless, and that any change made to correct one aberration was liable to disturb the other i some idea may be formed of what the amount of that obstacle would have been. It will, however, be evident, that if any objectglass is but made achromatic, with its lenses truly worked and cemented, so that their axes coincide, it may with certainty be connected with another possessing the same requisites, and of suitable focus, so that the combination shall be free from spherical error also in the centre of its field.

For this the rays have only to be received by the front glass B, from its shorter aplanatic focus F, and transmitted in the direction of the larger correct pencil FA of the other glass A. It is desirable that the latter pencil should neither converge to a very short focus, nor be more than very slightly, if at all, divergent; and a little attention at first to the kind of glass used will keep it within this range, the denser flint being suited to the glasses of shorter focus and larger angle of aperture. If the two glasses which in the diagram are drawn as at some distance apart, are brought nearer together (if the place of A, for instance, is carried to tbe dotted figure), the rays transmitted by B in the direction of the larger aplanatic pencil of A, will plainly be derived from some point (Z) more distant than F' r , and lying between the aplanatic foci of B; therefore (according to what has been stated) this glass, and consequently the combination, will then be spherically over-corrected. If, on the other hand, the distance between A and B is increased, the opposite effects are of course produced.

In combining several glasses together, it is often convenient to transmit an under-corrected pencil from the front glass, and to counteract its error by over-correction in the middle one.

Slight errors in colour may, in the same manner, be destroyed by opposite ones; and on the principles described, we not only acquire fine correction for the central ray, but by the opposite effects at the two foci in the transverse pencil, all coma can be destroyed, and the whole field rendered beautifully flat and distinct.^[56. PhiL Trans. 1830, p. 199.] Compound Achromatic Microscopes, with Solid and Fluid Lenses.

In 1812, a very simple method was employed by Sir David Brewster, for making both single and compound achromatic microscopes. Almost all objects are seen to the greatest advantage when immersed in a fluid, even the finest test objects, such as the scales of the Podura. Having placed the object on a piece of glass, he put above it a drop of an oil having a greater dispersive power than the single lens, or than the concave lens which formed the object-glass of the microscope. The lens was then made to touch the fluid, so that the surface of the fluid was as it were formed into a concave lens. Now if the radius of the outward surface of this lens was such as to correct the dispersion, we have here a perfect achromatic microscope, both simple and compound. The best way is to over-correct the colour of the plate-glass lens by the fluid, and then to reduce the dispersion of the fluid by mixing it with one of a less dispersive power. This will be understood from the annexed diagram, where AB is an unequally convex lens, the flattest side of which is plunged in the fluid mn, placed in a watch-glass CD. The object is placed at mn, and the dispersion of the concave surface of the fluid compensates that which is produced by the lens. All errors of centring are here removed, and also the loss of light at the touching surfaces of solid lenses. If AB is a single microscope, the object mn will be placed in its principal focus, and the emergent parallel rays will enter the eye; but if it is the object-glass of a compound microscope, an image will be formed a few inches behind AB, by withdrawing AB a little from mn, or placing the object a little without its principal focus. W’e have already had occasion to describe an achromatic grooved sphere, but in the process of achromatizing it, tlιe sphere loses in a very small degree its valuable property of refracting in the very same manner all the pencils that enter the eye. This property, however, may be preserved in the bird’s-eye sphere by the achromatic method which we have now described. Let AB be the grooved sphere, and CD the watch-glass containing the fluid; it is obvious that every ray which passes through the centre of the sphere will enter and k quit it perpendicularly, without suffering any refraction? The same mode of achromatizing the sphere AB may be adopted[7:15:41] with a solid concentric concave lens ABCD of flint-glass or other substance, or the sphere may be placed between two such concentric lenses. The greater the dispersion of the flint-glass, the nearer must the outer surface CD approach to AB. By these means the grooved sphere may be rendered perfect, both as a single microscope and as the objectglass of a compound one.

The principle above described may be applied to a system of object-glasses like those of Selligues’ microscope. Let A, B, E be three convex lenses, so placed at the end of the tube of a compound microscope, that the highly dispersive fluid in the watch-glass CD will enter between' the glasses A, B, and E. The concave lenses of fluid will over-correct the three lenses A, B, aàd E; but if a very deep curvature on the outside of A is not sufficient to compensate this over-correction, it may be effected by a suitable lens at F. If the three lenses are made of the precious stones, with a high refractive power and a low dispersive one, the concave fluid lenses will not over-correct them.

Description of Mr Pritchards Compound Achromatic Microscope.

This instrument is represented in Plate CCCLX. fig. 21, 22, 23, as fitted up by Mr Pritchard. All its parts are so distinctly shown in the figures, that they require no description, especially as the uses of most of the parts have been described in a former chapter. Fig. 21 is a perspective view of the instrument in its most convenient position for examining transparent objects by reflected light. The stops and condensing illuminator, which are seen under the stage, should be removed when particular objects are viewed. When test objects are to be viewed by direct light, the instrument can be turned round. Fig. 22 shows the position of the instrument for dissecting. The rest for supporting the hands is shown at a, and the large moveable stage at b. Fig. 23 shows the proper position of the instrument for viewing opaque objects by the concave reflector c. In front of c, the object is placed upon a black or white ground, according to its nature; and the light of the candle, collected and thrown upon the mirror c by the condensing lens, is again reflected by the mirror upon the object. Fig. 22 is an eye-piece; and fig. 23 represents an apparatus for holding a bottle to show aquatic plants and animals.

In Mr Pritchard’s instrument the following are the dimensions and powers of the lenses for a complete microscope.

Of these object-glasses, that whose focal length is ½th of an inch appears to be the most perfect and useful.

Compound Reflecting Microscopes. ∣

Sir Isaac Newton seems to have been the firfet person who described a reflecting microscope. He communicated his plan to Oldenburg in 1679, as shown in the annexed diagram, where AB is a concave speculum, 0 the object, F the place where an image of it is formed, and CD an eye-glass for magnifying it. In another letter to Oldenburg, dated 11th July of the same year, he refers to another improvement on microscopes, which is to “illuminate the object in a darkened room, with the light of any convenient colour, not too much compounded ; -for by that means the microscope will, with distinctness, have a deeper charge and larger aperture, especially if its construction be such as 1 may hereafter describe.” Wc are not aware that this idea was ever further developed by its author.^[57. Brewster’s Life of Sir Isaac Newton, p. 311.] Mr Potters Improvement upon it.

Mr Potter^[58. Edinburgh Journal of Science, Jan. 1832, No. XI. p. 61.] has recently described “a new construction of Sir Isaac Newton’s microscope,” principally with the view of removing the difficulty of illuminating the object. His first construction was for opaque objects; and in order to illuminate them, he cut a large circular aperture abc in the tube, between the object and the speculum; but the light which fell on the sides of the tube occasioned a good deal of indistinctness in the field of view. This defect, however, was completely removed by lining all the lower parts of the tube with black velvet. Mr Potter found it advantageous to concentrate the light on these objects that required it, by a large lens at d. For transparent objects he applied a lens, as shown at e. Its convergent beam is reflected on the object placed at the end of the wire a, fixed to a handle A, by means of a small diagonal mirror in the axis of the tube, and inclined to this axis 45°. By this means a very strong light may be thrown through, and past the object. By means of moveable caps to cover the opening abc, and the lens e, all interference of foreign light is prevented; and without altering the position of the object, both methods of illumination may be successively adopted. Mr Potter attaches his objects to thin brass pins α stuck into wooden handles h, and these pins pass through a slit cut into a small piece of cork attached to the sliding piece g, which at the same time carries the lens e and the plane mirror, the whole of which are moved by the small arm connected to the crank, as at i. The adjustment of the object to the focus of the mirror is effected by turning a nut attached to the pivot on which the crank is fixed.

In the microscope used by Mr Potter, he employs a speculum one inch in diameter, with a focal length of 1½ inch; and he generally employs a distance of from 12 to 14 inches between the object and the image.

This size of the speculum allows him to place an insect [7:15:42] or other object of ½th of an inch square in the tube, without any perceptible bad effect resulting from it.

When Mr Potter had adjusted the illuminators in the manner which we shall afterwards have occasion to describe, he “saw quite easily what are called the diagonal lines on the scale from the wing of the white cabbage butterfly, which has been proposed as a difficult test object by Dr Goring; and it is such a one as those who have only seen the stronger longitudinal striae or scales from the wings of moths and butterflies have little idea of.” Mr Potter was also able to resolve a delicate blue tissue in the web of a spider called the clubiona atrdx, into its component fibres.

The great size of speculum used by Mr Potter arises from his being able to give all his specula a true ellipsoidal figure, so as to remove all spherical aberration.^[59. The process by which he does this is fully described in the Edinburgh Journal of Science, No. 12, new series.] We have in our possession t&o of Mr Potter’s instruments, one of them with a spherical and the other with an ellipsoidal mirror. The quantity of light and the defining power of the latter are unusual in such instruments.

Amici's Reflecting Microscope.

This instrument is shown jn section in the annexed figure, where a is a small ellipsoidal speculum about 1 inch in diameter, and 2 τ ¾ths in focal length. The object is placed on a stage mn, below the tube of the microscope, and the rays which issue from it fall upon a small speculum b inclined 45° to the axis of the ellipsoidal speculum, in the same manner as if the object had been placed in the tube as far to the right hand of the small mirror as it is below it. An image of this object is of course formed in the.other focus of the ellipsoidal speculum, and may be viewed by a single or double eye-piece, as in other compound microscopes. Professor Amici, however, uses a negative eye-piece, consisting of two plano-convex lenses A, B.

The new and peculiar part of this instrument is the use of the small speculum, which allows the object to be placed without the tube, and illuminated with the utmost facility. Dr Goring, to whom science is indebted for the perfection of the reflecting microscope, remarks, that “the instrument was turned out of Professor Amici’s hands in a rough and ineffective state, owing to the concave metal being of too long a focus and too small an angle of aperture, and the diagonal one (or small mirror b, which was half an inch in diameter) of too large a diameter, which caused it to intercept too large a quantity of light from the other, leaving only a narrow rim of reflexion to enter the retina, which occasioned a disagreeable nebulosity in the middle of the field of view, unless the eye-glass was of great depth.”^[60. Goring and Pritchard’s Μicrogrαρhiα, p. 23.] Dr Goring's Improved Reflecting Microscope.

Mr Cuthbert, an ingenious London optician, constructed one of Amici’s instruments, the speculum having 1⅜ inch of aperture, and a focal length of 3 inches, and the body of the microscope being about 1 foot long. Dr Goring and he having tried it on the test objects which the doctor had newly introduced, found its performance quite unsatisfactory. Dr Goring, therefore, recommended that the speculum should be only half an inch in focal length, and the body 4 or 5 inches long. Mr Cuthbert accordingly finished a pair of metals six tenths of an inch in focal length, and only three tenths in diameter. The excellent performance of this instrument induced Dr Goring and Mr Pritchard to turn their attention to its improvement; and, as Mr Cuthbert^[61. The process by which Mr Cuthbert is able to accomplish this difficult task is similar to that by which he gives truly hyperbolic figures to the mirrors of small Gregorian telescopes, with three inches of aperture and five inches of focal length.] has been able to execute perfectly ellipsoidal metals, having an aperture equal to their sidereal focal length, or 54°, and of so small a diameter as three tenths of an inch, they have been able to produce an instrument of a very perfect kind.

This microscope is represented in Plate CCCLXI.fig. 26, 27, where the instrument is seen to rest on a tubular pillar, its body being held by a split socket. The pillar is screwed to a solid cruciform stand, to one of the legs of which an adjusting screw is applied, to produce steadiness. The body moves round a cradle joint at the top of the pillar, and may be firmly fixed at any degree of inclination. The body of the microscope is shown at a, the eye-tube at d, and the eye-piece, which is a Huygenian one, at e. The focal lengths of the interior glasses of the eye-pieces, of which there are usually three, are three fourths, three eighths, and three sixteenths of an inch. The tube containing the specula is shown at bc. The triangular bar which carries the illuminating reflector, the stage, and the apparatus for adjustment, is shown at t ∕ and is soldered to the neck of the body. The mirror k is plane on one side, and has a plaster of Paris surface on the other. The stage l is a combination of rack and screw work, wrought by two concentric milled heads at m. The smallest of these moves the object in the direction of the body, and the other in an opposite direction. The stage can be lifted out of the triangular socket q, which carries the adjusting screw i for obtaining distinct vision, and the clamping screw lι.

When the body and stand are used for a compound achromatic microscope, a tube, shown in fig. 27, and containing the compound object-glasses below it, increasing in diameter from the object, is screwed into the body at b, in place of the tube be. A rectangular prism, shown in dotted lines, reflects the pencils that pass through the object-glasses along the axis of the tube be to the eye-piece e.

The following sets of metals are made for the reflecting microscope.
[table]

The metals No. 1, 2, and 3 arc those most useful for examining opaque objects. No. 3 is excellent also for all kinds of transparent objects. No. 5 can scarcely be used for opaque objects, as it leaves almost no space between the tube and the object for allowing the latter to be illuminated. No. 6 cannot be used at all for opaque objects, but is especially intended for the most difficult class of transparent test objects.
[7:15:43]

Dr Snιitlιs Reflecting Microscope.

Having constructed one of Sir Isaac Newton’s microscopes in 1738, Dr Smith of Cambridge observed that the colours of objects were much more beautiful and natural than in refracting microscopes. He found that objects were very distinct and sufficiently light when the microscope bad the following dimensions :—

Focal length of the speculum 2½ inches.

Diameter of ditto 1

Focal length of the plano-convex eye-glass 2½

Ratio of the distance of the object from the fo cus of the speculum to the focal distance of the speculum 1 to 19.

Finding that, in order to obtain a high magnifying power, the speculum required to be very concave and small, he contrived another microscope with two reflecting spherical surfaces of any size, but so related to each other that the second reflexion should correct the aberration of the first. This instrument is shown in fig. 31.

Dr Smith’s microscope is shown in fig. 31, where AA is a concave spherical speculum, having its polished convex surface inwards. The rays from an object o placed in the slider mn will be reflected from the concave speculum AA upon the convex CC, and will have a distinct and magnified image of it formed before the convex eye-glass E, by which it will be magnified still more. This instrument, in short, is nothing more than the Cassegrainian telescope converted into a microscope, with this difference only, that in the telescope distinct vision is obtained by moving the, convex mirror, whereas in the microscope it is obtained by a motion of the eye-glass. Dr Smith constructed one of these microscopes, which he found to perform “nearly as well, in all respects, as the very best refracting microscopes ;” and the writer of this article has one of them now before him, which performs wonderfully well, though both the specula have their polish considerably injured. It shows the lines on some of the test objects with very considerable sharpness.

The following are the dimensions, &c. of Dr Smith’s reflecting mirror, as given by himself:—

Focal length of both specula l∙0000

Distance of the centres of both specula 1∙6558

Distance of the image from the centre of the con cave speculum I∙l337

Focal length of the eye-glass 0∙l407

Distance of the eye behind the eye-glass 01479

Diameter of the eye-hole 0 0190

Distance of the object from the centre of the con vex speculum 0∙0626

Length of the concave speculum 15° 49'

Arch of the convex speculum 4° 50/ 4,9"

Distance of the stop s from the object 0∙4545

Diameter of the stop s .... e ...0038

Diameter of the hole in the concave speculum 0∙I43 Diameter of the hole in the convex speculum 0O49

Magnifying power, the focal length, &c. of the eye being 8 inches 300 times.

The dimensions of the instrument in our possession is very different:

Diameter of the concave speculum 2∙17 inches.

Focal length 2∙17

Diameter of the hole in it ∖ 0 - 376

Diameter of the convex speculum 1∙03

Diameter of hole in it 0∙10

Diameter of stop 0∙13

Distance of stop from hole in convex speculum..0 ’ 67 Distance of specula 3 ’ 80

Focal length of doubly convex eye-glass 0 ’ 17

Sir David Erezνster r s Reflecting Microscope.

Notwithstanding the excellence of Professor Amici’s miscroscope, as constructed with Dr Goring’s improvements and with Mr Cuthbert’s specula, we are quite convinced that it does not owe these advantages to the peculiarity in its construction which constitutes it a different instrument from Newton’s. This peculiarity is in our opinion a disadvantage, and we consider the instrument as recommended solely by its possessing an ellipsoidal speculum, with a large angle of aperture. The only advantage which can be ascribed to Amici’s instrument is a more convenient mode of illumination, though not much more so than Mr Potter’s; but this advantage, whatever be its amount, is purchased at great sacrifices. 1. The whole instrument is an a t wkward-looking piece of mechanism, with its triangular bar and all its appendages dangling at one end of it. 2. It cannot be used in the vertical position, which we consider a very great defect. 3. By the use of the small reflecting speculum, more, than one half of the whole light is lost. 4. With small concave specula, such as those τ 3 θths of an inch in diameter, opaque objects cannot be illuminated, as stated by Dr Goring.

The construction which has been proposed by Sir David Brewster to remedy most of these defects is shown in the annexed figure, where ABC is the body of the instrument, which screws at its lower end C into the horizontal projecting arm DE of the stand, either of the achromatic microscope or the single microscope, so that we get rid of all trouble about the objects placed at mn, and their mode of illumination, as every thing concerning them is the same as in other microscopes. This, we must say, is a great advantage; for neither naturalists nor amateurs are disposed to purchase and use two sets of the extended apparatus necessary for holding, moving, and illuminating microscopic objects. At the lower end C of the body, exactly where the object-glasses of the compound and achromatic object-lenses are placed, is a small tube abed, at the lower end of which is placed the concave speculum cd, perforated with a very small hole at its centre, and with its concave surface upwards. Above it is the plane speculum s, fixed by a slender arm to the side bd of the small tube, and having its diameter a little greater than the perforation in the speculum cd. This little tube abed screws into the arm DE, as if it were a microscopic doublet or single lens; and the body ABC may [7:15:44] either screw upon the outside of this tube, or, what is better, upon a stronger piece of tube forming part of the arm DE. A concave illuminating reflector kh, for opaque objects, may screw on the back of the speculum cd, or that speculum may be made thick, and ground and polished on both sides, so that while one side magnifies the objects, the other illuminates them.

It is obvious, that rays proceeding from an object at mn will be reflected from the plane speculum e, upon the concave speculum cd, exactly as if the objects were placed at τ, as far above e as mn is below it, and an image of it would be formed in the other focus of the ellipsoid, r being the one focus, if the rays were not intercepted by the eye-piece AB, by which the image is farther magnified. By this mode of construction, the whole of the reflecting microscope, in place of having a separate stand and separate apparatus costing a large sum of money, is comprehended in the little tube abed, and may be considered as a reflectingobject-speculum, forming part of a general microscope, furnished with single lenses, doublets, and compound ach-ro ma tics.

By the means now described are removed all the defects which we enumerated as belonging to Amici’s combination, except the third, which is one of such importance that it is of consequence to consider how far it is capable of being remedied. Sir David. Brewster has proposed to get rid of this loss of light by placing the object mn, as in Amici’s instrument, outsideof the tube, but inclined to its axis, and refracting its rays upon the specu-lurçi cd, by means of an achromatic prism e, in a manner analogous to his method of producing a similar effect in the Newtonian telescope.^[62. Treatise on Optics, Lardner’s Cabinet Cyclopaedia, p. 3õ4.] The faces of this prism are equally inclined to the axis of the microscope and the axis of the pencil issuing from the point of the object under examination. As the prisms of plate and flint glass which compose e are cemented by a substance of nearly the same refractive power, there will be no farther loss of light than what is reflected at the two surfaces. A socket may be placed at D, for holding an illuminating lens, or the little apparatus for opaque objects, shown in Plate CCCLXI. fig. 27. But in order to avoid the encumbrance and expense of separate stands and apparatus for this, as well as Amici’s form of the instrument, we would propose that a strong piece of tube should be inserted in the opening, above mn, to screw into the upper side of the projecting arm, as shown in the preceding figure; or a solid screw attached to the upper side of the tube, a little to the right hand of C, and above the opening, might screw into the lower end of the projecting arm DF. In these cases the object at mn will be placed on the ordinary stage, and illuminated in the common manner; but it will be necessary to have a counterpoise at D, to balance the weight of the body ABC.

Those who are acquainted with the principle of the Cassegrainian telescope, and of Dr Smith’s compound microscope, will readily see that the reflecting microscope, with the perforated speculum, may be converted into a more compound reflector, analogous to Dr Smith’s, by making the little speculum e, fig. 33, convex, the figures of d and e being made hyperboloids.

CHAP. III.—ON SOLAR AND OXYΠYDROGEN MICROSCOPES.

The solar microscope is a well-known popular instrument, for exhibiting on a white screen in a dark chamber, magnified images of minute objects, illuminated by the condensed light of the sun. As the sun cannot often be commanded in our climate, this instrument may be considered as having fallen into disuse; but the discovery of the lime-ball light by Mr Drummond amply supplies the place of the great luminary, in so far as the microscope is concerned. The instrument has accordingly been revived under the name of the oxyhydrogen microscope, and is now a favourite public exhibition.

The solar microscope was proposed by Dr Lieberkhun in 1738; and early in 1739, when he paid a visit to London, he exhibited an instrument of his own construction to several members of the Royal Society, and to Mr Cuff, Mr Adams, and other London opticians.

This microscope is nothing more than a convex lens, in front of which, a little farther from it than its principal focus, is placed a microscopic object, the rays of the sun being reflected in a horizontal line, and condensed by a lens. This will be understood from the annexed figure, where CD is the convex lens, E the object placed before it, and AB the illuminating condenser. An enlarged image of E will be formed to the right hand of CD, on a wall or screen, and the size of the enlarged image will be to that of the object as the distance of CD from the screen or wall is to CE, the distance of the object from the lens. Dr Lieberkhun’s solar microscope had no mirror for reflecting the sun’s rays into the tube, so that it could only be used a few hours, when the tube could be conveniently pointed to the sun. The improvement of adding a mirror was made by Mr Cuff, who constructed the instrument in a very superior manner.^[63. See Baker on the Microscope, vol. i. p. 22.] Dr Lieberkhun subsequently fitted up the solar microscope to show opaque objects; but the method which he employed is not known. Since the time of Mr Cuff, the solar microscope has undergone many improvements. Mr Benjamin Martin added greatly to the value of this instrument, by fitting it up both for opaque and transparent objects, in the manner shown in Plate CCCLXI. figs. 28 and 29. In fig. 28 it is shown as fitted up for opaque objects. The body ABCDEF has the part ABCD of a conical, and the part CDEF of a tubular form. A large convex lens, corresponding with AB, in fig. 34 is placed at AB, at the end of the conical tube ABCD, which screws into the square plate QR, which is fastened to a window-shutter opposite a hole of at least the size of the lens AB, by means of the screw e, d. Upon the square plate QR there is a moveable circular plate abc. To this circular plate is attached the silvered glass mirror NOP, placed in a brass frame, which moves round a joint PP, and which may be placed in any position with regard to the sun, so as to reflect his rays into the tube ABCD by means of rack-work and pinions at Q and R. The pinion Q moves the circular plate abc (to which the mirror NOP is fixed) in a plane perpendicular to the horizon, while the nut R gives it a motion in an opposite plane. The [7:15:45] light introduced by this mirror falls upon the lens AB, which throws it in a condensed state upon any object in the tube. But before it reaches the opaque object, it is received by a mirror Μ, placed in the box HILX, which reflects the condensed light back upon the face of the object E, fig. 34, next to the lens CD, fig. 34. This mirror is adjusted to a proper angle by the screw S.

Above the body ABEF is seen the part ∕VK which carries the sliders or objects, and the object-glass or lens CD, fig. 34. The tube K slides within the tube V, and V again slides into the box HILX. These tubes carry each a magnifying lens. The inner tube K is sometimes taken out of the other V, seen within the box, and used alone. The sliders and objects are introduced into a slit or opening at H. The brass plate to the left of H is fixed to a tube A, by means of a spiral wire within the tube, which presses the plate against the side of the box HILX, so that the sliders, when placed in the opening, are pressed against the side of the box.

In using this microscope, the sun's rays are first made to pass along the tube ABCD, by the nuts Q and R. The box for opaque objects, HILX, is then slid by its tube G into the tube EF. The slider containing the object, having its face to be examined turned to the right hand, is then pushed into the opening at H, till the object is in the centre of the tubes V, K. The condensed light falling on the mirror Μ is then thrown back on the face of the object in the slider, and the door hi shut. Upon a white paper screen or cloth, from four to eight feet square, and placed at the distance of from six to ten feet from the window, the observer, in the room made thoroughly dark, will see on the screen a magnified representation of the object, which may be rendered distinct at different distances of the screen, by pulling out or pushing in the tubes V, K containing the convex lenses. As the sun is constantly moving, its rays must be kept in the axis of the tubes by now and then turning the nuts Q and R.

When the microscope is to be used for transparent objects, the box HI LX, with its tube G, and other appendages, is removed, and the apparatus shown in fig. 31 substituted for it. This is done by sliding the tube Y of fig. 31 into the tube EF of fig. 30. A slider containing the magnifying lens is then slipped through the opening at n, and a second condenser may or may not be inserted in the opening at h. The slider with the object is then placed in the opening m, and when its magnified picture falls upon the screen, it is adjusted to distinctness by turning the milled nut 0.

The picture formed by a solar microscope being in Dr Robison’s opinion “generally l so indistinct that it is fit only for amusing ladies,” he proposed to use as an objectglass the achromatic eye-piece of four lenses, constructed by Mr Ramsden for telescopes. Having made the experiment, he found the image “perfectly sharp,” and recommended this application “to the artists, as a valuable article of their trade.”

A much simpler method, however, of correcting the defects of the microscope, is to use compound achromatic lenses, which were first suggested by Mr Benjamin Martin.

Another mode of improving the instrument was proposed in 1812 by Sir David Brewster,^[64. Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments, p. 410.] who has described a new solar microscope, which can be rendered achromatic. The method of doing this is shown in the diagram, fig. 34, where AB is the condensing lens, and CD the object-glass, cemented firmly into one end of a tube »zCD?z, which has a tubular opening at E, while the other end of the tube has a circular piece of parallel glass cemented upon it. The tube wCDn is then filled with water, or any other fluid; and the object, when placed upon a slider, or held in a pair of forceps, is introduced at the opening E into the fluid. The mechanism for producing these effects is easily conceived. By the instrument thus constructed, imperfectly opaque and corrugated objects, rendered transparent, and extended by the fluid medium, may be examined in this microscope, though incapable of being used in any other. Objects may be even dissected in the aqueous tube. Nay, objects preserved in spirits might be exhibited by immersing the bottle, if it is small, in the trough or tube ∞CDλ, See Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments, p. 401, for an account of the advantages of examining objects immersed in fluids. 2

But the most important purpose effected by this form of the instrument is, that it can be rendered perfectly achromatic by using a fluid of higher dispersive power than the glass lens CD, and making the interior curvature of the side CD, which touches the fluid, of that degree of convexity which will convert the fluid into a concave lens capable of correcting the colour of CD. The lens CD may be made most advantageously of fluor spar, which, from its low dispersive power, might form an achromatic combination with water.

Although, in so far as we know, metallic’specula have never been regularly fitted up as a reflecting solar microscope for use, yet every person familiar with, and in the habit of using, specula and lenses, must have made the experiment of forming magnified images both in solar and artificial light, with small concave specula. The perfection of these images cannot be doubted; and it has often appeared to us surprising that the optician did not avail himself of such a combination for a solar microscope. Neither the Newtonian nor the Amician form of the instrument offer facilities for this purpose. Sir David Brewster has therefore proposed to employ his form of the reflecting microscope for a solar and oxyhydrogen instrument. Its facilities for this purpose are very great, and there can be little doubt that it will be practically successful, and will be as superior to other solar microscopes as the best reflecting compound microscope is to other compound microscopes. Dr Goring made an experiment with the Amician microscope; but he obviously considers it as not likely to succeed, remarking, that “after all that could be done, a refractor would be sure to beat it hollow; therefore I shall take my leave of the subject, as I cannot conscientiously recommend such an instrument.”^[66. Dr Goring states, that a friend of his had constructed a solar microscope with metals on the Araician principle, and without a body or eye-glass, which exhibited a variety of test objects in a highly satisfactory manner.] It is no wonder that this experiment failed, because Dr Goring seems to have used the whole of the Aηιiciaη microscope, eye-glasses and all, as the magnifier in the solar microscope, and therefore it could not be considered as a reflecting solar microscope, being in fact as much a refracting one. The construction to which we have above referred is shown [7:15:46] in the annexëd figure, where AB is the illuminating lens, throwing the condensed rays of the sun upon a transparent object mn. The rays from this object falling upon the small speculum e, are reflected to the deep concave speculum cd, so placed, that the image is formed at MN on a screen at some distance behind it, distinct vision being obtained either by moving the object or the speculum.

For opaque objects this form of the instrument is peculiarly adapted. The parallel rays of the sun falling upon the deep speculum kh, are condensed by it and thrown on the inner face of the object mn, of which a magnified image is formed, as before, at MN. A greater condensation of light may be obtained by using the lens AB, so that the speculum kh shall receive its convergent beam before the rays reach their focus and complete their convergency.

ìn this construction we have the disadvantage of two reflections, belonging also to the Amician form ;’ but this may be considered as compensated by the image being without the tube, and more under our command. Though this is true in the compound microscope, yet the advantage of having the object outside the tube is of less consequence in a solar microscope. To avoid therefore two reflections, and two mirrors with their relative adjustments, Sir David Brewster has proposed to construct the reflect ing solar microscope in the manner shown in the annexed figure, where CD is the perforated concave speculum, mn the object in one of its foci, and MN the magnified image in its other focus. The object mn, placed on a slider passing through an opening in front of the speculum, is illuminated as an opaque object by the lens AB, whose refracted rays are farther condensed by a lens placed in the aperture of the speculum. This form of the solar microscope is therefore singularly adapted for opaque objects; and as the whole of the effect of the instrument is produced by a single reflection from a single surface, it is the simplest optical instrument in existence. In order to throw light upon mn as a transparent object, the rays must pass through it in-an opposite direction from the side MN, and this may be done by the very same method given by Mr Potter, and represented in fig. 29.

The simplicity and practical value of this instrument will be immediately recognised by comparing it with the complex opaque box, which in all solar microscopes is a necessary appendage for opaque objects. See Plate CCCLXI. fig. 28 and 29.

Dr Goring s Solar Camera Microscope.

Dr Goring, whose indefatigable genius has improved almost all our popular instruments, has described in the Mi-crograpkia a very complete solar microscope, which has the property of exhibiting the image on a horizontal curved surface, placed in a darkened camera, at which two or more persons can look at the same time. It is in reality a new instrument, but can also be used like the common solar microscope in a darkened room.^[67. Dr Goring calls this instrument a Solar Engiscoρe, while he gives the name of Solar Microscope to the same instrument when used in a dark room in the common way. The introduction of the image into a camera becomes thus the reason for changing a microscope into an cngiscope. The word engìscope, however appropriate it may be as a companion to the word telescope, is quite inapplicable to any kind of solar microscope.]

This instrument, with ail its parts, is shown in Plate CCCLXI. figs. 30,31,32, and 33; fig. 30being a geometrical elevation of the instrument one-tenth of the real size, the various parts being represented as if formed of transparent matter. A strong framework A of wood rests upon four legs, having a large hole in it, into which the instrument is fixed with two screws F, F. The frame is large enough to protect the observer from the solar rays. A long plane mirror B is fixed to an arm C, which moves round a pin fixed to the side of the mirror frame, and also round a joint attached to a strong round wire E, which slides backwards and forwards in the tube D, having a spring within, and a pinching nut to fix it in its place. The inclination of the mirror is varied by pulling out or pushing in the mirror, which has also another motion produced by the action of the milled head G on a rack and pinion. A common illuminating lens, five inches in diameter and one foot in focal length, is placed at H. Dr Goring recommends an achromatic lens^[68. See Edinburgh Journal of Science, No. xi. new series, p. 85, and our chapter on the Illumination of Microscopic Objects.] ε (which would be a very expensive appendage), though he says that he has never used one. The main body of the microscope is conical, having a hayonet catch at L to receive the rest of the instrument, viz. the tube carrying the stage and rackwork. This tube 11 moves within the conical one by means of the milled head Μ and rack and pinion N. The end of this tube is closed, and an ordinary slider-holder 0 is fixed to it. On the inner side of the stage, near N, is fixed a condensing lens, about one and a half inch in diameter and two inches in focal length, which, by means of a sliding wire passed through a hole in the stage, can be moved from one side of the tube to the other, and also made to approach to or recede from the stage. A second tube PPP, slit open at the sides, is screwed into the tube in which the stage moves; and into this tube the optical part q is made to slide, the objectglass being placed at K. Dr Goring here remarks, that “the focus may of course be roughly adjusted, by sliding the body backwards and forwards in its containing tube, before it is attached to the camera, fig. 31; but when this has been done, it must of course remain immoveable. I look upon it,’’ he continues, “as a principle in the solar microscope, that the magnifier or object-glass should not be moved, but always remain at a fixed distance from the illuminators Perhaps we do not distinctly understand the import of this passage; but we apprehend that the magnifier or object-glass may be, nay, must be moved in any way that is necessary to produce distinct vision upon the screen, whatever be its distance; and that the essential condition is, that the distance of the illuminator and the object shall be invariable, the object being, if possible, accurately situated in the focus, unless where a slight deviation is necessary to prevent its destruction by the concentrated heat of the solar rays.

The end of the tube Q is now pushed into another piece of tube at R, fig. 31, which communicates with a conical tube of brass, “having a rectangular prism, with its reflecting side silvered,^[69. Dr Goring is surely mistaken in saying that the side of the prism should be silvered ; for as total reflection commences at 41° 49 , for glass, and takes place at all greater angles of incidence, the light incident at 45° will be totally reflected. But even if the least oblique part of the conical beam should penetrate the reflecting surface (which it cannot do), part of the picture would have the light of silvered reflection, and the other part the double light of total reflection, which would never answer. We would prefer a plane metallic speculum to the prism, even if sufficiently homogeneous not to affect the accuracy of the picture.] or a plane metal adjusted at its head S, [7:15:47] so as to throw down the image to the bottom of the box or camera, where it is to be received on paper (at T), or on a surface of plaster of Paris duly curved to suit its shape.” The camera WWXX is constructed with windows V, V. to permit two persons to view the picture on the table T. Two pieces of wood WW carved out to fill the slope of the upper part of the face, are placed as in the figure (one of them is shown separately in a plan at fig. 33). Dr Goring adds, that “he has found it necessary to exclude the breath from entering the camera, as it dims the eye-glass of the engiscope, and thus spoils the image but he does not mention whether this is the object of the pieces of carved wood, or whether they are used to keep extraneous light from the eye,^[70. In using this, and all other optical instruments where perfect vision is either agreeable or essential, we would recommend the use of the Greenland snow spectacles, cut to suit the individual from a plaster of Paris cast of the eyes, nose, and brow.] which, in so far as the figure indicates, does not appear to be the case.

The sides U, U of the camera may be removed at pleasure, to allow the observer to draw the picture on the table, the light being excluded by some black drapery, while the hand passes through a suitable opening in it. Dr Goring recommends that the whole of the exterior (interior ?) of the conical brass tube and camera should be well blacked, or lined with black silk velvet.^[71. Mr Potter found black velvet to be superior to any other blacking for the interior of his reflecting microscope. Edin. Journ. of Science, No. xi. p. 62, new series.]

In applying this instrument to opaque objects, the opaque box, shown in fig. 32, is applied to the conical tube in fig. 26 by means of the bayonet catch at L. A plane mirror R, adjusted by the screw S, throws the light of the illuminator to the object 0 placed in the conjugate focus of the eye-glass K, by means of the milled nut Μ and screw T, which causes the stage and the object to approach to or recede from the lens K.^[72. The illumination is here far too oblique. The mirror should be nearer P, and the screw MT should be made to move the object-glass K, in order that the focus of the illuminator may always fall on the object O.] The stage is formed by a piece of cork covered with black velvet. PP is the tube into which the bodv q of the microscope is inserted, as in fig. 26.

This instrument may be converted into a common solar microscope by unscrewing and removing the tube PP, and placing a simple object-glass in an appropriate mounting at Μ. The whole apparatus is then removed from the frame A, and screwed to a window shutter in the usual way.

On the Oxyhydτogeη Microscope.

The great popularity of the public exhibition made with this instrument has turned the attention of opticians and amateurs to its improvement. Mr Pritchard has written a long and interesting chapter of nearly fifty pages on the subject of solar and oxyhydrogen gas microscopes, in the Micrographia already referred to, and has given a most popular and minute account of all the details of the instrument. These details, to which we must refer our readers, do not belong to an article like the present; and we shall content ourselves with explaining what an oxyhydrogen microscope is, and how the optical apparatus of a solar microscope may be readily converted into that of an oxyhydrogen one, and vice versa.

An oxyhydrogen gas microscope differs from a solar one chiefly in this, that a brilliant light obtained by igniting a ball of lime the ’ size of a pea (hence called the pea or lime light, or more appropriately the Drummond light, from its inventor Mr Drummond) with oxyhydrogen gas, is substituted in place of the solar rays. This enables us to enjoy the amusement of the solar microscope apparatus in all weathers and at all hours of the day.

As the lime-ball light, however, is at our elbow, it sends forth diverging rays; whereas the rays of the sun are parallel. A very beautiful principle, already referred to in our article Micrometer, enables us to give the simplest direction for this purpose. Let AB be the illuminating lens of the common solar microscope, throwing the parallel rays ef of the sun upon the object mn, and let the whole instrument be in perfect adjustment; then, without moving or changing any part of it, we may convert it into an oxyhydrogen microscope, where the light diverges from the lime ball L, simply by placing in front of AB another lens CD, whose focal length is equal to the distance of the lime-ball light L from the lens AB. The oxyhydrogen microscope will then have its objects at mn illuminated in precisely the same way as they were by the sun’s rays. The two lenses CD, AB, should be in contact, the space being left to show the parallel rays ef. Now, as L is the focus of the lens CD, the converging rays ef will be parallel, and consequently will be refracted by AB, exactly as if they had been the rays of the sun.

If the instrument had been made originally as an oxyhydrogen microscope, with a large and deep lens at AB, which would be required to refract rays diverging from L tó inn, then we might convert the instrument into a solar microscope by simply placing a concave lens in front of AB, whose focal distance is equal to the distance of L from AB. This concave lens will give such a divergency to the parallel rays of the sun that they will have their focus at mn.

Our readers will find the most ample details respecting the gas apparatus, and the method of managing and using the instrument, in Mr Pritchard’s Essay in the Micrographia already cited.

CHAP. V. ON THE ILLUMINATION OF MICROSCOPIC OBJECTS.

The methods of illuminating microscopic objects that have been long in use have been described in the preceding chapters. They consist in throwing light upon the object, either by means of a mirror or a lens, or both combined; but the nature of the light employed, the magnitude of the pencil, its condition with regard to parallelism, divergency or convergency, and the diameter of the pencil employed, or the direction in which it falls upon the object, have never been discussed as matters of science, and upon which the performance of the finest instrument essentially depends.
[7:15:48]

In so far as we know, the most important of these topics was pressed upon the notice of the scientific reader by Sir David Brewster, in the year 1820; and in order that the progress of improvement in this essential branch of the art of making discoveries with the microscope may be understood, we shall quote his observations on the subject.

“The art of illuminating microscopic objects is not of less importance than that of preparing them for observation. No general rules can be given for adjusting the intensity of the illumination to the nature and character of the object to be examined; and it is only by a little practice that this art can be acquired. In general, however, it will be found that very transparent objects require a less degree of light than those that are less so; and that objects which reflect white light, or which throw it off from a number of lucid points, require a less degree of illumination than those whose surfaces have a feeble reflective force.

“Most opticians have remarked, that microscopic objects are commonly seen better in candle-light than in day-light; a fact which is particularly apparent when very high magnifying powers are employed; and we have often found that very minute objects, which could scarcely be seen at all.in day-light, appeared with tolerable distinctness in candle-light. So far as we know, the cause of this has not been investigated; and as it leads to general views respecting the illumination of microscopic objects, we shall consider it with some attention.

“Let LL, fig. 38, be a single microscope placed before the eye at E, and let /be a microscopic object placed in its anterior focus, and illuminated by two candles at A and B. As the rays Afa and B∕S cross at f, the focus of parallel rays, and as the two shadows of the microscopic object will be formed at a and b, as it were, by rays diverging from f the images of these two shadows formed upon the retina will coincide and make only one image, so that the object f will appear perfectly distinct. If the object, however, is placed either within or without the focus f, its shadows being formed, as it were, by rays diverging from a point either within or without the principal focus fi wilΓ not coincide on the retina, but appear to form two images, either overlapping each other, or completely separated. If, instead of two candles, A, B, we have 4, 5, or 6, we shall have 4, 5,-or 6 overlapping or separated images. Now, as it is impossible to place the different parts of a microscopic object exactly in the focus f, and as every lens has different foci for the differently coloured rays, and even for homogeneous light, in consequence of its spherical aberration, it necessarily follows, that when microscopic objects are illuminated by light proceeding from several points, the image upon the retina must consist of a number of images not accurately coincident; and hence it becomes of the greatest importance that the object be illuminated only from one point, and not from a large surface of light, such as the sky, which is equivalent to an infinite number of radiant points.

“The following rules may therefore be laid down respecting the illumination of microscopic objects, and the method of viewing them.

“1. The eye should be protected from all extraneous light, and should not receive any of the light which proceeds from the illuminating centre, excepting that portion of it which is transmitted through or reflected from the object.

“2. Delicate microscopical observations should not be made when the fluid which lubricates the cornea of the observer’s eye happens to be in a viscid state, which is frequently the case. See Brande’s Journal, vol. ii. p. 127.

“3. The figure of the cornea will be least injured by the lubricating fluid, either by collecting over any part of the cornea, or moving over it, when the observer is lying on his back, or standing vertically. When he is looking downwards, as into the compound vertical microscope, the fluid has a tendency to flow towards the pupil, and injure the distinctness of the vision.

ii 4. If the microscopic object is longitudinal, like a fine hair, or consists of longitudinal stripes, the direction of the lines or stripes should be towards the observer's body, in order that their form may be least injured by the descent of the lubricating fluid over the cornea.

“5. The field of view should be contracted, so as to exclude every part of the object, excepting that which is under immediate examination.

“6. The light which is employed for the purpose of illuminating the object, should have as small a diameter as possible. In the day time it should be a single hole in the window-shutter of a darkened room, and at night it should be an aperture placed before an argand lamp.

“7. In all cases, and particularly when very high powers are requisite, the natural diameter of the light employed should be diminished, and its intensity increased by optical contrivances.

“8. When a strong light can be obtained, and indeed in almost every case, homogeneous light should be thrown upon the object. This may be done either by decomposing the light with a prism, or by transmitting it through a coloured glass, which has the property of admitting fc only homogeneous rays.”

In the same article Sir David Brewster has described “a new method of illuminating objects in the solar and the lucernal microscopes.” “The great defects,” says he, “which still attach to the solar and lucernal microscopes, arise from the imperfect method of illuminating the objects. The method suggested by Aepinus, and employed almost universally by opticians, of reflecting the light concentrated by a lens upon the objects, by means of a plane mirror, is good enough so far as it goes; but in consequence of the light arriving from one direction only, the surface of the illuminated object is covered with deep shadows, and the intensity of illumination is by no means sufficient when the power of the instrument is considerable. We propose, therefore, that in the solar microscope the sun’s light should be reflected by a very large mirror through four apertures, A, B, C, D (surrounding the tube T), each of which is furnished with an illuminating lens. The four cones, if condensed, are then received, before they reach their focus, each by an inclined mirror, which reflects them upon the object; the distance of the lens from the mirror, added to the distance of the mirror from the object, being always less than the focal length of the illuminating lens. In the lucernal microscope it would be desirable to place an argand lamp opposite each of the apertures A, B, C, D. By these means the light would fall upon the surface of the object in four different directions; a high degree of illumination would be obtained for very dark objects; and by shutting up one or more of the four lenses, or parts of them, we shall b e enabled to find the particular direction of the light w hi c } i i s b es t suited for developing the structure which it is the object of the observer to discover:’ Although the focus of the illuminating rav»
[7:15:49]

should always fall upon the object, for the reasons already assigned, yet in the preceding method, applied to the solar microscope, a deviation from this rule becomes necessary, for two reasons: lsi, Because, if the focus of the illuminating lens fall exactly upon the object, it might burn it, or destroy it by corrugation; and, ⅛dly, In the ordinary illuminating lenses, the diameter of the focal spot, or image of the sun, is not sufficient to cover the whole object, or to give a sufficient luminous field around it. For these reasons it is recommended in the preceding extract to place the object a little way within the focus of the illuminator, that is, between the illuminator and its focus. But if the object is such that it cannot be injured by the solar heat, or if the illuminator is sufficiently large to give a focal spot capable of filling the field of the microscope, then the object should be placed in the solar focus of the illuminator.

After a lapse of nearly ten years, the subject of microscopic illumination was discussed by Dr Wollaston, in his paper on the microscopic doublet, published in the Phil. Trans, for 1829. This eminent philosopher, whose ingenuity never failed in executing in the best manner whatever he attempted, was then on his death-bed; and this, among other papers, was published without that complete revision which its author would otherwise have given it.

“The state of my health,” says Dr Wollaston, “induces me to commit to writing rather more hastily than I have been accustomed to do, some observations on microscopes; and I trust that, in laying them before the Royal Society, they will meet with that indulgence which has been extended to all my former communications.

“In the illumination of microscopic objects, whatever light is collected and brought to the eye beyond that which is fully commanded by the object-glasses, tends rather to impede than to assist distinct vision.

“My endeavour has been to collect as much of the admitted light as can be done by simple means, to a focus in the same plane as the object to be examined. For this purpose I have used with success a plane mirror to direct the light, and a plano-convex lens to collect it; the plane side of the lens being towards the object to be illuminated.”

These two principles of illumination, the first of which is the same as the first and fifth of the rules already given, though not so fully developed, and the second founded upon a mistaken principle, have been carried into effect by Dr Wollaston in the following manner:

“T, U, B, E represents a tube about six inches long, and of such a diameter as to preclude any reflection of false light from its sides; and the better to insure this, the inside of the tube should be blackened. At the top of the tube, or within it at a small distance from the top, is placed either a plano-convex lens ET, or one properly curved, so as to have the east aberration, about ∣ths of an nch focus, having its plane side next the object to be viewed; and at the bottom is a circular perforation A, of about γ⅞ths of an inch diameter, for limiting the light reflected from the plane mirror R, and which is to be brought to a focus at α, giving a neat image of the perforation A, at the distance of about ⅛ths of an inch from the lens ET, and in the same plane as the object which is to be examined. The length of the tube, and the. distance of the convex lens from the perforation, may be somewhat varied. The length here given, six inches, being that which it was thought would be most convenient for the height of the eye above the table, the diameter of the image of the perforation A must not, excepting with lower powers than are here meant to be considered, exceed one twentieth of an inch.

“The intensity of illumination will depend upon the diameter of the illuminating lens and the proportion of the image to the perforation, and may be regulated according to the wish of the observer.

“The lens ET, or the perforation A, should have an adjustment by which the distance between them may be varied, and the image of the perforation be thus brought up to the same plane as the object to be examined.

“For the perfect performance of this microscope, it is necessary that the axis of the lenses, and the centre of the perforation A, should be on the same right line. This may be known by the image of the perforation being illuminated throughout its whole extent, and having its whole circumference equally well defined. For illumination at night, a common bull's-eye lanthorn may be used with great advantage.

“Supposing the plano-convex lens to be placed at its proper distance from the stage, the image of the perforation may be readily brought into the same plane with the object, by fixing temporarily a small wire across the perforation with a bit of wax, viewing any object placed upon a piece of glass upon the stage of the microscope, and varying the distance of the perforation from the lens by screwing its tube until the image of the taire is seen distinctly at the same time with the object upon the piece of 'glαss.' ’

In the preceding passages we have extracted every one of Dr Wollaston’s observations in reference to his method of illuminating microscopic objects, so that the reader will be enabled thoroughly to understand it.

This method of illumination was highly commended by optical writers. Dr Goring^[73. Microscopic Illustrations, Exord. p. 1, Lend. 1830.] considered it as most effective, and enumerates it among the inventions which founded a new era in the history of the microscope; and he elsewhere states, that “there is no modification of daylight illumination superior to that invented by Dr Wollaston.”^[74. Microscopic Cabinet, p. 181, Lond. 1832.]

The marked difference between the methods of illumination proposed by Dr Wollaston and Sir David Brewster, induced the latter to publish, in 1831, a paper “On the Principle of Illumination of Microscopic Objects.”^[75. Edinburgh Journal of Science, new series, No. AI. p. 83.] In this paper the mistake committed by Dr Wollaston is clearly pointed out. The rays which Dr Wollaston throws upon the object, in place of being rays actually converged to a focus, as they ought to be, are rays which diverge from a focus situated between the object and the lens. He makes the focal point of the circular margin of the perforation fall upon the object, without considering that the rays which pass through that perforation do not diverge from it, and therefore cannot be collected in the conjugate focus corresponding to the perforation. In Dr Wollaston’s diagram (Phil. Trans. 1829, plate ii. fig. 1), the rays which are incident on the mirror R are actually drawn as parallel rays; and it is quite clear that he meant them to be parallel rays issuing from the bull’s-eye lanthorn which he re [7:15:50] commends. But if we suppose that a common flame is used, the error is just of the same nature. It is a distinct image of the flame that should be thrown upon the object; and hence the perforation A should be placed close to the flame,—the source of light and the illuminated object forming the conjugate foci of the lens. After explaining this principle, Sir D. Brewster adds in the same paper :—“I have no hesitation in saying, that the apparatus for illumination requires to be as perfect as the apparatus for vision ; and on this account I would recommend that the illuminating lens should be perfectly free of chromatic and spherical aberration, and that the greatest care be taken to exclude all extraneous light, both from the object and from the eye of the observer”

At the meeting of the British Association at York in 1831, the preceding methods were communicated to Mr Potter, who was then engaged in inquiries with the reflecting microscope, and who had used only the common method of illuminating his objects. The effect which he obtained by it is thus described.^[76. Edinburgh Journal of Science, new series, No. XI. p. 64.] “I am indebted to Dr Brewster for information on the necessity of having the focus of the illuminating lens for transparent objects to fall exactly upon the object, when great nicety of vision is required. Having adjusted my microscope carefully on this point (see our figure, p. 41, where the object is seen in the focus of the illuminating rays), I saw quite easily what are called the diagonal lines on the scale from the wing of the white· cabbage butterfly, which has been proposed as a difficult test object by Dr Goring; and it is such a one as those who have only seen the stronger longitudinal striae on scales from the wings of moths and butterflies have little idea of.” By the same means Mr Potter’s instrument “showed him easily not only the striae on the scales of the wing of the small house-moth, but also the diagonal lines.” Mr Potter afterwards applied his microscope, and the new method of illumination, to “a much more difficult object than those just referred to.” This object is the broad bluish band first noticed in the web of the spider, the Clubioηa atrox. ^[77. It is found in the crevices of old walls, and may be recognised by its irregular fleecy-looking web.] “There can be no doubt,” says Mr Potter, “that this blue band consists of lines produced by the spider, and woven into the delicate tissue. To demonstrate these fibres, however, is a work for an expert microscopist, provided with a first-rate instrument. So critical a defining power is required, at the same time with a large quantity of light, that I doubt much whether any compound refracting microscope, even the best achromatic, will ever show the construction of this web on a transparent object. When viewed in this manner through good common compound microscopes, the blue band can scarcely be perceived at all with a moderately high power. It is better seen as an opaque object by the light of the sun, and it was on this method that I discovered it, when highly illuminated and highly magnified, to be covered very regularly and closely with white spots. This was sufficient information that it was of an uniform texture; but as there is always in such a light a strong display of irradiations and prismatic colours, it was impossible to trace the fibres. I had discovered something of the texture with small globules of glass, used after the manner prescribed by Leewenhoeck; but with very high powers the distinct field of view is so small, that I dared hardly to pronounce decidedly upon the general structure; and it was only after adjusting the illuminating lens of my microscope very carefully, that I saw with it the complete structure of a regularly woven net.” ^[78. Mr Pritchard received from Mr Potter a specimen of this web; but though he detected the blue bands, yet, as the specimen was not a recent one, he was unable to perceive “the complete structure of a regularly woven net." ( List of 2000 Microscopic Objects p. 6, 7∙)]

After this strong testimony to the practical utility òf Sir David Brewster’s method of illumination, and the unquestionable optical principles on which it is founded, we were surprised to observe that Dr Goring and Mr Pritchard should, in the Microscopic Cabinet, published in 1832, still recommend and use a method so decidedly erroneous in theory, and founded on no optical principles whatever. Dr Goring has even contrived what he calls an improved illuminator, which is just Dr Wollaston’s, with a stop in the focus of the lens.

As the progress of discovery with the microscope must depend upon the scientific illumination of the objects under examination, we shall proceed to describe, in detail, the method of illumination used by Sir David Brewster. Let mn be the plane surface on which the object rests accurately perpendicular to the axis of the lens, lenses, or mirrors, which constitute the microscope. Let PQRST be a tube from one and a half to two inches long, and wholly lined with black velvet.

This tube has an opening at ST, and must be so attached by an universal joint, or any analogous contrivance, to the slider-hold-≈ er, that the axis FL of the tube can be inclined at any angle to the surface mn from 90°, its general position, to 60° or less, as circumstances may require. It should also have a circular motion about its axis, in order that the inclination may be made in any azimuth. A doublet AB, CD, of no aberration, and having a focal length of from half an inch to an inch, is then placed in the tube, with a rack and pinion, or any other adjustment, to bring its focus for parallel rays F, or its conjugate focus for diverging rays, accurately to a point in the plane mn, and upon the object lying in that plane, for examination. A short way below it is placed a metallic speculum (not a silvered glass one), which receives parallel or diverging rays, entering the tube at ST, and reflects them upon the doublet ABCD. This speculum should be of pure virgin silver, notwithstanding its liability to tarnish, and should be wrought with the same care as the plane speculum of a Newtonian telescope; or it might be a rectangular prism of good homogeneous glass, acting by total reflection. This part of the illuminator forms part of the microscope.^[79. If the axis of the microscope is placed horizontally, or even with some obliquity, we may dispense with this speculum altogether, and direct the tube at once to the illuminating flame.] The other part of the illuminator, which is detached, is no less essential. It consists of the flame S, which should be as bright and small as will give the necessary quantity of light after condensation. As close to it as possible is placed a stand for holding a screen, with different circular apertures, and a variable rectilineal aperture. If a stronger light is required than can be obtained from the plane S, its light must be condensed into a parallel beam SL, by another doublet of no aberration, A'B'C z D', the flame S being in its anterior focus.

The illuminator, as now described, is adapted to homogeneous light, either as obtained from a monochromatic lamp, or by means of coloured glasses, or from the prismatic spectrum; but if we employ common light, the doublets ABCD, A'B'C'D' must be achromatic. We have [7:15:51] mentioned above a variable rectilineal aperture. This is a most essential accompaniment for giving perfection to the vision of lined objects. The aperture should be made to form every possible angle with a vertical line, and should be opened and shut by means of a screw, till as much light is introduced as is necessary to obtain a perfect view of the object. The image of the slit, which is close to the flame, must be thrown upon mn, so as to be parallel with the lines of the object. When the objects are circular, circular apertures are preferable to any other.

We have already stated that no light should reach the eye, either from the field of the microscope, or any other source. For this reason it would be desirable to have circular and rectilineal apertures of different sizes, to be placed immediately beneath rnn, so as to allow no part of the field to be seen, excepting that which is occupied by the object or part of it under examination.

The above apparatus being provided, let us suppose that the observer is called to examine some structure very difficult to be resolved, such as the blue band of the Clubiona atrox, or the structure and nature of the lines on test objects. We omit at present the consideration of the preparation of the object and the eye of the observer, and also the nature of the light which he is to use, as these will be separately considered; and confine ourselves to the use of the illuminator. The object is first placed on a piece of thin colourless parallel glass, or film of topaz or sulphate of lime, near its middle, and the microscope is directed to it, so that it can be seen distinctly in the ordinary way. Put the illuminator in its place, and set the proper aperture close to the small plane. Adjust the doublet ABCD by its screw or pinion till a distinct image of the aperture GH is seen in the field; and, by means of the apertures below mη, any strong or unnecessary light may be still more completely excluded. If the structure is not rendered sufficiently distinct by this process, it will be proper to try the effects of oblique illumination, by inclining the axis FL of the illuminator to the plate mn, and observing carefully the effects which it produces in different azimuths. If all these means are insufficient, we must have recourse to new auxiliaries,—to monochromatic light if the microscope is not achromatic, or to monochromatic illumination if it is achromatic; and we must prepare both the eye and the object, the one for exhibiting and the other by viewing to the best advantage the structure which we are anxious to develope. These important topics we shall treat in their order, with as much brevity as possible.
