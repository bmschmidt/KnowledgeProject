MOLFETTA, a city of the kingdom of Naples, in the province of Bari. It is situated on the sea-shore, and has a harbour, which is fit only for the reception of small vessels, but from it an extensive fishery is carried on. It is a place of various manufactures, each upon a small scale. The most considerable is the refining of saltpetre on account of the government, which yields about 10,000 quintals yearly. This city is the seat of a bishop, who has a handsome cathedral. There are six other churches and five monasteries, and also a collegiate institution for the education of the clergy. The population amounts to 11,496.
