MYCENAe, in Ancient Geography, a town of Argolis, in Peloponnesus. The kingdom of the Argives was divided into two portions by Acrisius and his brother Proetus, and Argos and Mycenae were their capitals. These, as belonging to the same family, and distant only about fifty stadia, or six miles and a quarter from each other, had one tutelary deity, Juno, and they were joint proprietors of her temple, the Heraeum, which was near Mycenae. It was here that Agamemnon reigned. He enlarged his dominions by his valour and good fortune, and possessed, besides Mycenae, the region about Corinth and Sicyon, and that which was afterwards denominated Achaea. On his return from Troy, he was slain with his companions at a banquet. Mycenae then declined, and under the Heraclidae was made subject to Argos. The Mycenaeans, having furnished eighty men, partook with the Lacedaemonians in the glory acquired at Thermopylae. The jealousy of the Argives produced the destruction of their city, which was abandoned after a siege, and laid waste in the first year of the seventy-eighth Olympiad, or 466 years before Christ. Some part of the wall remained in the second century, with a gate, upon which were lions, a fountain, the subterranean edifices where Atreus and his sons had deposited their treasures, and, amongst various sepulchral monuments, one of Agamemnon, and another of his fellow-soldiers and sufferers.
