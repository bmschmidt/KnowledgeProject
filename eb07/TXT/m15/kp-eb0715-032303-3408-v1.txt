MOLISE, a province of the kingdom of Naples, which extends in east longitude from 14. 7. to 15. 5., and in north latitude from 4L 18. to 41. 51., being 1261 square miles in extent. It is divided from the province of Terra di Lavoro by the snowy mountains of Matese, the highest chain of the Apennines, whence the principal rivers, the Biferno, the Trigno, and the Tammaro, have their sources. The province comprises nine cities, sixteen market-towns, and seventy-seven villages, with 206,670 inhabitants, chiefly subsisting by agricultural labour, and having few manufactures and little commerce. Molise produces sufficient corn, oil, and wine for the consumption; and of the first it forms a kind of granary for Campania. Hemp, flax, and silk are also produced, but in small quantities. The capital is the city of Campobasso.
