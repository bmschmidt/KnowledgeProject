MONKWEARMOUTH, a town of the county of Durham, in the ward of Chester, 275 miles from London. It is divided from Bishopswearmouth by the river Wear, over which there is a bridge made wholly of cast iron, except the pins binding the parts together, which are of wrought iron. It is sufficiently high to admit of ships passing under it without lowering their topmasts. An ancient monastery stood here, from whieh its name is in part derived. The population amounted in 1801 to 1103, in 1811 to 1091, in 1821 to 1278, and in 1831 to 1498. Adjoining to it is the populous district or suburb, but comprised in the same parish, Monkwearmouth Stone. It is chiefly inhabited by sailors, and by a numerous class called keelmen, who are employed in conveying coals in barges, provincially called keels, from the interior of the country to the larger vessels.

The population of this district amounted in 1801 to 4239, in 1811 to 4264, in 1821 to 4924, and in 1831 to 6051.
