MOVEABLE, in general, denotes any thing capable of being moved. Moveable feasts are such as are not always held on the same day of the year or month, though they be on the same day of the week. Thus Easter is a moveable feast, being always held on the Sunday which falls upon or next after the first full moon following the 21st of March. All the other moveable feasts follow Easter, that is, they keep their distance from it, so that they are fixed with respect thereto. Such are Septuagesima, Sexagesima, Ash Wednesday, Ascension Day, Pentecost, Trinity Sunday, and the rest.
