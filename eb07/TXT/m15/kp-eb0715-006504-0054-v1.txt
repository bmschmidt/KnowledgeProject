MILDEW is said to be a kind of thick, clammy, sweet juice, exhaled from, or falling upon, the leaves and blossoms of plants. By its thickness and clamminess it prevents perspiration, and hinders the growth of the plant. It sometimes rests upon the leaves of trees in the form of a fatty juice, and sometimes upon the ears of corn. It is naturally tough and viscous, and becomes still more so by the sunâ€™s heat exhaling its more fluid parts; by which means the young ears of corn are so daubed over that they never arrive at their full growth. Bearded wheat is less subject to the mildew than the common sort; and it is observed that newly-manured lands are more liable to mildew than others. The best remedy is a smart shower of rain, and immediately afterwards a brisk wind. If the mildew be observed before the sun has attained power, it has been recommended to send two men into the field with a long cord, each holding one end; and drawing this along the field over the ears, the dew will be dislodged from them before the heat of the sun has been able to dry it to the viscous state in which it does the mischief, or rather, perhaps, to occasion that rapid evaporation which produces a degree of cold sufficient to nip and chill the ears, or, in other words, to affect them with mildew. Some are of opinion that lands which have for many years been subject to mildews have been cured of it by sowing soot along with the corn, or immediately after it is sown.
