MULIER, in Law, signifies the lawful issue born in wedlock, though begotten before. The mulier is preferred to an older brother born out of matrimony; as, for instance, if a man has a son by a woman before marriage, which issue is a bastard, and afterwards marries the mother of the bastard, and they have another son, this second is mulier and lawful, and becomes heir of the father; but the other can be heir to no person. By the civil law, where a man has issue by a woman, and after that marries her, the issue is mulier.
