MILO, or Melos, an island of European Turkey, in the Archipelago. It is about sixty-six square miles in extent. It is mountainous and volcanic, and though in ancient times reported to have been populous, is now so unhealthy, that the population of less than 700 persons can only be kept up by annual emigrations from the Morea. The chief town of the same name is on the south part of the island, and is said once to have had 200 houses, but now has not so many inhabitants. Long. 24. 8. E. Lat. 36. 40.
