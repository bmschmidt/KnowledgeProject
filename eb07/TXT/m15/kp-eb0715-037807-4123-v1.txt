MONA, in Ancient Geography, is a name applied to two islands in the sea between Great Britain and Ireland. The one, described by Caesar as situated in the middle passage between both islands, called Monaoeda,· Mοηaρia, or Monabia, is supposed to be the Isle of Man. But there was [7:15:379] another Mona, an island more to the south, separated from the coast of the Ordovices by a narrow strait. This was the ancient seat of the Druids, and is now called Anglesey, the island of the Angles or English.
