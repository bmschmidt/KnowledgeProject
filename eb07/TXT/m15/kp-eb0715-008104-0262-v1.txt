MILLE Passus, or Millia Passuum, a very common expression amongst the ancient Romans for a measure of distance, commonly called a mile. Milliarium, rarely used. A Roman mile Hesychius made to consist of seven stadia; Plutarch, little short of eight; many others, as Strabo and Polybius, eight stadia and no more. The reason of this difference seems to be, that the former had a regard to the Grecian foot, which is greater than the Roman or Italic. This distance is oftentimes called lapis, from the stone by which it was marked or indicated.
