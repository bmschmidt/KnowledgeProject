MITRE, a sacerdotal ornament worn on the head by bishops and certain abbots upon solemn occasions, being a sort of high cap, pointed and cleft at top. The high priest amongst the Jews wore a mitre or bonnet upon his head; and the inferior priests of the same nation had likewise their mitres, but in what respect they differed from that of the high priest is uncertain. Some writers contend that the ancient bishops wore mitres; but this is by no means a settled point.
