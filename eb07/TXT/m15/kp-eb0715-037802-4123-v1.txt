MOLOSSES, Molasses, or MÃªlasses, the gross fluid matter of sugar remaining after refining, and which no boiling will bring to a consistence more solid than that of syrup. Properly, molasses are only the sediment of one kind of sugar called Chypre, or brown sugar, which is the refuse of other sugars, and cannot be whitened or reduced into loaves. Molasses are much used in Holland for the preparation of tobacco, and also amongst poor people instead pf sugar. There is a kind of brandy or spirit made of molasses; but it is held by some to be exceedingly unwholesome.
