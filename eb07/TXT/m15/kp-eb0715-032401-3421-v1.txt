MOLLUSCA.

The Molluscous animals to which our attention is to be directed in this article, formed, for a long period, two distinct objects of study. The naked species were considered as constituting a particular group, to which the term Mollusca was in a great measure restricted; whilst the shelly species attracted a large share of attention, being known as objects of study by the term Conchology. Of late years, however, this kind of systematical separation of the naked and shelly species has been supported by few advocates, whilst those who have urged the propriety of their union have not only been numerous, but acknowledged as the intelligent and successful investigators of nature. In consequence of these changes, which have taken place in public opinion by the introduction of more correct notions of the principles of classification, we have in this edition of our work, resolved on incorporating the articles Mollusca and Concπology, suppressing the latter term as unnecessary. Indeed, in a physiological point of view, there is no definite boundary between the naked and the shelly species, many of the reputed naked species having shells concealed under their integuments, while in many of the shelly species, the solid plate or shell can only be reached by removing the surrounding soft or fleshy matter. But the propriety of abandoning the old divisions will become sufficiently obvious, when wë consider that all the species belong to one group in the Invertebrate class of animals; that the organs of the species have many points of resemblance; and that although differences prevail in the character of the protecting covering, the gradations from one condition of the integuments to another, are too minute, in many cases, to admit of precise limits being fixed. We shall therefore consider shells as peculiar modifications of the external coverings of certain species, and, in this subordinate character, incorporate the naked and shelly species; having recourse to the integuments, however, in connection with the other organs, in the distribution of the genera and other divisions of the class now denominated Mollusca.

In treating of this extensive division of the invertebrate animals, we shall confine our remarks to a general view of their physiology, taking notice of the peculiarities of their forms, organs, and functions. This will prepare us for a condensed view of the progress of the science, in reference to systematical arrangement, and the illustration of the characters of those divisions or groups into which the species may be distributed, whether for assisting the student in his labours of investigation, or for facilitating the judicious disposition of the established truths of the science. We shall then advert, in the last place, to molluscous animals as objects of utility. The limits of the article will unavoidably restrict us to a very brief exposition of the various subjects connected with this very extensive department of natural history.

CHAP. I PHYSIOLOGY.

Molluscous animals exhibit very remarkable differences, both in their form and in the number and position of their external members. Neither head nor foot can be observed in some species; the principal organs being enclosed in a bag pierced with apertures for the entrance of the food, and egress of the excrementitious matter. In others, with an exterior still remarkably simple, cuticular elongations, termed Teιιtacula, surround the mouth, and a foot, or instrument of motion, may likewise be perceived. This last organ is in some free at one extremity, in others attached to the body throughout its whole length. In many species there is,a head, not, however, analogous to that member in the ver-' tcbral animals, and containing the brain and organs of the senses, but distinguished merely as the anterior extremity of the body, separated from the back by a slight groove, and containing the mouth and tentαculα.

In many of the animals of this division, the different members of the body are in pairs, and are arranged, in reference to a mesial plane, into right and left. In some, a part only of the organs has respect to a mesial plane, other parts being single, or in unequal numbers. In other species, the organs, which are not in pairs, are arranged round a central axis, and give to the external form a radiated appearance. But these characters are exceedingly variable and uncertain, as indicating the limits of particular tribes; since, in different parts of the same animal, modifications of all these forms may be readily distinguished.

The skin of molluscous animals is more simple in its structure, than the same organ in the vertebral animals. The cuticle is here very distinct; and, as in other classes, it is thick and coarse where much exposed, but thin and delicate in its texture, where it lines the internal cavities. A mucous web may be detected in the cuttle fish and slug, but of great tenuity. The corium is destitute of a villous surface; and on its central aspect it is so intimately united to cellular substance, that its fibrous structure can scarcely be distinguished. The muscular web maý, in general, be readily perceived. Its fibres proceed in various directions, according to the kind of motion to be executed, and extend or corrugate the skin at pleasure.

The appendices of the skin in this class of animals ought to be carefully studied, as they furnish the most obvious marks for distinguishing species, and for constructing divisions in their systematical arrangement. The appendices of the cuticle are few in number, and perhaps ought to be considered as limited to hairs. These, in some species, invest the surface regularly and closely, and may be observed on those which live on land, as well as those which reside in water. In some cases the hairs may be considered as united, and forming continuous crusts or ridges. These hairs, as well as the cuticle, are liable to be worn off, and in some places can seldom be perceived, unless in early age.

The most important appendix to the skin, for such it must be considered, appears to be the shell. This part is easily preserved, exhibits fine forms and beautiful colours, and has long occupied the attention of the conchologist. The matter of the shell is secreted by the corium, and the form which it assumes is regulated by the body of the animal. It is coeval with the existence of the animal, and appears previous to the exclusion from the egg; nor can it be dispensed with during the continuance of existence. The solid matter of the shell consists of carbonate of lime, united with a small portion of animal matter, resembling coagulated albumen.

- The mouth of the shell is extended by the application of fresh layers of the shelly matter to the margin, and its thickness is increased by a coating on the inner surface. These statements are abundantly confirmed by the observations of Reaumur, (Mémoires de V Académie des Sciences, 1709), whose accurate experiments have greatly contributed to the elucidation of conchology. If a hole be made in the shell of a snail, and a piece of skin so glued to the inner margin as to cover the opening, the shelly matter will not ooze out from the broken margin of the fracture, and cover the outside of the skin, but will form a coating on its inner surface, [7:15:325] thus proving it to have exuded from the body of the animal. When a portion of the mouth of the shell of a snail is broken off, and a piece of skin glued to the inner margin, reflected outwardly, and fixed on the body of the shell, the defective part is again supplied, and the matter added to the inner surface of the skin, thus leaving the interposed substance between the new formed portion and the fractured edge. Similar experiments, repeated on a variety of shells, both univalve and bivalve, by different naturalists, leave no room to doubt that shells increase in size by the juxtaposition of shelly matter from the common integuments.

Each calcareous layer is more or less enveloped in the animal matter which we have already stated as being present; so that the different layers of successive growth may, by various processes, be distinctly exhibited. If the shell has been exposed for a short time in the fire, the animal matter will appear charred, and its black colour, contrasted with the white earthy matter, will indicate the arrangement of the different strata; in the same manner as the ivory and enamel of a tooth can be distinguished, when subjected to similar treatment. The same satisfactory results may be obtained by a different process. If the shell be steeped in weak muriatic acid, the earthy matter will be dissolved, and the flakes of albumen will remain as the frame-work of the edifice.

The layers of growth may often be distinguished on the surface of the shell, in the form of striae or ridges, more or less elevated, but parallel to the margin of the aperture. Other inequalities may likewise be observed on the surface, at right angles to the layers of growth, such as ridges, knobs, and spines. These last derive their origin from the inequalities of the skin on which they have been monlded.

In some univalve shells, the layers of growth parallel to the opening cannot be discerned; when exposedin the fire, there is little darkening of colour; and when dissolved in acids, but a feeble trace of animal matter remains. In the fire, these shells crack in various directions, but exhibit no trace of a scaly structure. By careful management with the file, the shell may be separated into a central layer contiguous to the skin, and a peripheral layer, both similar in structure, though frequently differing in colour. The shells exhibiting such characters have been termed porcellaneous, from their dense structure, and the fine polish which their surface presents. The formation of shells of this kind must take place in a different manner from those of the first kind which we have noticed.

If we attend to the form of a young shell belonging to the genus cypraea of Linnaeus, we may perceive that an addition of shelly matter to the margin of the aperture, in the manner in which it is applied in other shells, would not enlarge the cavity, but completely close the aperture. The increase of the shell, (accompanied with a corresponding increase of its inhabitant), must take place, therefore, either by absorption of the accumulated shelly matter of the mouth, and an elongation in the direction of the greatest curvature of the shell; or the old shell must be thrown off, and a new one produced, suited to the size of the animal. The former supposition has not been entertained, the latter is now generally received by naturalists, though there are a few individuals unwilling to adopt such a view of the matter. The inner coat of such shells appears to be a transudation from the body of the animal, and the outer one to be laid on the surface by the loose reflected lobes of the cloak. In many other shells, portions of matter, more compact than the other parts, may be observed spread on the pillar, and applied to the margin of the mouth by a similar process. Mr. Platt, in support of Reaumur’s opinion, that shells are formed by juxtaposition, against the objections of Mr. Poupart, (Phil. Trans, vol. liv. p. 43), erroneously considers the different sizes of the cypreae as depending on the thickness of the shell increasing according to age, without admitting a cor responding increase of the dimensions of the contained animal, or cavity for its reception.

The shells of the first kind which we have noticed, from being formed of cones or layers applied to the inner edge of the margin, and extending beyond it, have an imbricated structure. Those of the second kind, consisting of layers regularly superimposed, have consequently a lαminateds,twιc- ture; but between the two kinds there are numerous intermediate links, formed by a combination of the two processes.

In some cases, the hard parts of the skin are not entitled to the appellation of shell, but may rather be considered as horn. Such are the coverings of the mandibles of the cuttle fish, the branchial lid of the aplysia, and the operculum of the welk. The two last appendices, however, though horny in some species, are shelly in others.

The position of the shell, with respect to the constituent layers of the integuments, exhibits very remarkable differences. In some it appears instead of a cuticle, or at least without an external membrane investing it. In general, however, it occurs between the cuticle and the skin; a position which induced Cuvier (Lec.AeAnat. Comp. xiv. 11.) to consider it as analogous to the mucous web of the vertebral animals. Its intimate connection with the muscular system of the animal, and the protection which it affords, seem adverse to such a conclusion. In many species the testaceous substance occurs in folds of the corium, or inserted in its substance. In this position it never acquires the solid texture which shells exposed, or covered only by the cuticle, exhibit. Those shells which are thus concealed are in general white; those which are more exposed are frequently coloured. The colouring, however, does not depend on the direct exposure to the light, as some have imagined, for many shells which are destitute of a cuticle are white, while many of those covered with a dense cuticle are finely variegated beneath.

Between the skin and the shell neither vessels nor nerves have been traced; and the manner in which the latter is formed, forbids us to expect their existence. Yet the shell cannot be considered as dead matter, so long as it remains in connection with the living animal. In those animals in which the shell is external, there are muscles which connect the animal with its internal surface, and the bond of union being a substance soluble in water, the muscle can be detached by maceration. The analogy between shell and bone is here obvious, although in the one case the connection between the muscle and the bone is permanent, in the other, between the muscle and shell, temporary, or frequently changed during the life of the animal. But the vitality of the shell, if I may use the expression, is demonstrated, from the changes which it undergoes when detached from the animal: the plates of animal matter harden: the epidermis dries, cracks, and falls off; and in many cases the colours fade or disappear. We confess ourselves unable to point out the means employed by the animal to prevent these changes from taking place, by any process similar to circulation. The difficulty, however, is felt in contemplating the functions of hairs, nails, and feathers, in vertebrated animals.

When the shelly covering consists of two or more pieces, they are joined together, as the articulated bones in the higher classes of animals, by ligaments. These, in some cases, are of great thickness and strength, and, in consequence of their elasticity, assist in the motion of the different parts.

In the molluscous animals the skin secretes a viscous, adhesive substance, differing according to the medium in which the animal resides, but in all cases calculated to resist its influence. It is probably owing to the lubricating agency of this secretion, that both the cuticle and shell are preserved from decomposition. The skin likewise secretes the colouring matter by which the shells are variegated.
[7:15:326]

The glands from which it proceeds vary much in different individuals, and even in the same individual in different periods of growth.

The characters furnished by the skin and its appendices are extensively employed in the systematical arrangement of molluscous animals. Nearly all those characters which distinguish the species, and many of those on which genera are established, are derived from the form of the shell, the tentacula, or the colour. This last character, however, is one on which little dependence should be placed.

There is nothing peculiar in the Μ oscular System of this class of animals. Where the muscles are inserted in the skin, as is usually the case, that organ is in some cases strengthened by condensed cellular substance, and even acquires a leathery density.

Molluscous animals preserve themselves in a state of rest, chiefly by suction and cementation. The organ which acts as a sucker, is in some cases simple, soft, and muscular, as the foot of the snail, while in others it is compound, and strengthened internally by hard parts, as in the arms of the cuttle fish. The force with which some animals adhere is very considerable, and is strikingly displayed, for example, when we attempt to detach a limpet from the rock.

The rest, which is maintained by cementation, in some cases depends on a glairy secretion, which glues the body of the animal to the substance to which it Is disposed to be attached. By such an expedient, the shells of snails adhere to rocks, stones, and plants. It is probable that the bivalve shells of the genus Cyclas, which readily adhere to the side of a glass, secure their temporary attachment by means of their glutinous cuticle. In other animals threads are produced, termed a byssus, from particular glands, and while one extremity is glued to the rock, the other remains in connection with the animal. But there is an attachment more durable than any of these, which takes place in some shells, they being cemented to rocks or stones by calcareous matter, and retained in the same position during the whole term of their existence.

The locomotive powers of the mollusca are confined to creeping and swimming. The former action is performed by alternate contraction and relaxation of the foot, or muscular expansion, which serves as a sucker, and is analogous to the motion of serpents. The motion of swimming is executed either by the serpentine undulations of the foot and the body, or by the action of tentacula, or expanded portions of the integuments. Many species are aided in swimming, by being able to vary the specific gravity of their body at pleasure, and either rise or sink in the water as circumstances may require. In some, as the Janthina, there is a cellular organ peculiarly destined for this purpose, which may be regarded as in some measure analogous to the air-bladder of fishes. In all these exertions the progress of molluscous animals is proverbially slow. Some bivalve shells have the power of leaping or shifting their position by a sudden jerk, produced by shutting the valves rapidly. This is strikingly displayed in the common Scallop, and is less perfectly exhibited in the river muscles. In a few instances, especially among the slugs, a thread is formed of the viscous secretion of the skin, by which the animal is enabled to suspend itself in the air from the branches of trees like a spider.

Although the progressive motions of molluscous animals are comparatively slow, the other muscular actions are executed with ordinary rapidity. The irritability of some parts, as the tentacula and branchiae, is so great, that the protecting movements arc executed almost instantaneously, and the organs are contracted or withdrawn into the body. But these rapid exertions are only called forth in the moments of danger.

The characters furnished by the muscular system, are of great value in the discrimination of species, and in the con struction of genera and higher divisions. They are intimately connected with the habits of the animal, and merit the attentive examination of the philosophical naturalist.

In the molluscous animals the Nervous System is less complicated in its structure than in the higher classes, and the brain is not restricted in its position to the head. The whole nervous system appears in the form of ganglia and filaments. The principal ganglion, or the one to which the term brain is usually applied, is seated above the gullet or entrance to the stomach. It sends out nerves to the parts about the mouth, the tentacula, and the eyes. It may be considered as analogous to the cerebrum of the vertebral animals. From this ganglion proceed two filaments, one on each side, which in their descent inclose the gullet, and unite underneath to form a second ganglion. From this last, which has been compared to the cerebellum, numerous filaments are likewise distributed to the parts around the mouth, and to the other regions of the body. These filaments in some cases again unite, and form subordinate ganglia. In many cases the brain and ganglia are of a reddish colour, and granιflated structure, while the nerves which issue from them are white and uniform, as in the genus Aplysia. The covering of the first ganglion, which is analogous to the dura mater, does not adhere to it closely, but leaves a space filled with loose cellular matter. The tunics of the nerves are equally detached; and as they can be inflated or injected readily, some have been led to suppose that the nerves were hollow, and others, that the tunics were the vessels of the lymphatic system.

The organs of perception common to the higher classes of animals, do not all exist in an obvious manner amongst the mollusca. The touch, that universal sense, is here displayed in many cases with great delicacy; and the tentacula, and the other cuticular elongations which we have already referred to, contribute to augment its resources. The sense of sight is by no means universally enjoyed by the inhabitants of this class. In a few species, the eye is constructed on the plan of the same organ in the vertebral animals. In general, however, it appears only as a black point, the peculiar functions of which can only be inferred from analogy. In many species there is no trace of an eye, consequently they cannot possess that varied information which the others derive from that organ. Where eyes exist in this class, they are uniformly two in number. In one tribe only, namely the cuttle-fish, the rudiments of the organs of hearing have been detected. The organs adapted to smelling cannot be exhibited, but the existence of the sense is demonstrated by the facility with which molluscous animals discover suitable food, when placed within their reach. The sense of taste appears to exist, but it is difficult to point out the particular parts of the mouth fitted for its residence. As, however, particular articles of food are selected in pre· ference to others, it may be concluded from analogy that taste regulates the choice.

In the classification of the mollusca, the characters furnished by the nervous system, from the difficulty of their detection and exhibition, have never come into use. But those furnished by the organs of preception are highly prized. Of these, the eye is the most obvious and constant. It varies in position in different species; but, among individuals of the same species its characters are constant.

In the cutaneous, muscular, and nervous systems, traces of a general plan may be observed, according to which they have been constructed in the different tribes. In the organs which remain to be considered, there is less uniformity of structure, each family almost, being constructed according to a model of its own.

The time when molluscous animals feed has not been carefully attended to. Those which live in the water are beyond the reach of accurate observation. Those that reside on land usually shun the light, and creep forth in the [7:15:327] evenings to commit their depredations. During warm, dry weather, they stir not from their holes.

The animals under consideration, feed equally on the products of the vegetable and animal kingdom. Those which are phytivoroιιs appear to prefer living vegetables, and refuse to eat those which are dried. We are not aware that putrid vegetable matter is consumed by them, although many of the snails and slugs are found under putrid leaves and decayed wood. In these places there is shelter from the sun, together with dampness, so that it is difficult to determine, whether they sojourn in an agreeable dwelling, or a well-stored larder. Those mollusca which are carnivorous, prey on minute animals in a living state, and many of them greedily attack putrid matter.

The means employed to bring the food within the reach of the organs of deglutition, are exceedingly interesting, both on account of their variety and success. Some are provided with tentacula for securing their prey, and conveying it to their mouth, as the cuttle-fish; others protrude a lengthened probosis, or an extended lip or tongue, as the limpet, and thus bring their food into the mouth. By many, however, which are fixed to the same spot during the continuance of existence, or only capable of very limited locomotive power, successful efforts are made to excite currents in the water, whereby fresh portions of it are brought in contact with the mouth, and its animal or vegetable contents separated. Where part only of any kind of food is taken into the mouth at once, the lips are possessed of sufficient firmness to cut off the requisite portions, or there are corneous mandibles to perform the office.

In the mouth, there is scarcely any process performed analogous to that of mastication, in the higher orders of animals. When the food is in the mouth, or entering into the gullet, it is mixed with saliva, as in the more perfect animals. The salivary glands in which it is secreted, are in general of considerable size, divided into lobes, and, in some cases, separated into distinct masses. In many species the existence of a gullet is doubtful, as the food seems to enter the stomach immediately; while, in others, there is a portion of the intestinal canal which has some claim to the denomination.

The stomach, in many instances, is membranaceous, and can scarcely be distinguished from the remaining portion of the intestinal canal. In some cases, however, it is strong and muscular like the gizzard of a bird, and even fortified with corneous knobs for the reduction of hard substances. In some species, the stomach opens laterally into the py-lorous, and, in a few instances, possesses a spiral coecum attached to it.

The liver is usually of very large dimensions, and seated close to the stomach, which it, in many cases envelopes. It is divided into many lobes, and receives numerous bloodvessels. There is, however, nothing analogous to the vena ρortαrum of quadrupeds. The bile is poured, in some, into the stomach, and, in others, into the pyloric extremity of the intestine by different openings. There is no gall-bladder.

There is no division of the canal into small and large intestines, as in the higher classes; or rather, among the mollusca, the relative size of the different parts is reversed. Here the pyloric extremity is usually the largest, while the anal is more slender. The intestine, as in fishes, is short in proportion to the length of the body, and in its course, is subject to few turns. The anus is, in some, placed on one side of the body; in others it is terminal, while in a few it opens on the back.

The digestive system is thus more simple in its structure than in the higher classes. It possesses neither pancreas, spleen, nor mesentery. And, we may add, that the calls of hunger are often at distant intervals, and the power of abstinence very great.

The characters furnished by the digestive system are extensively used in the inferior divisions of molluscous animals. The form of the lips, the position of the mouth and anus, and the structure of the stomach, deserve to be attentively considered, as indicating the habits of the species.

Circulating System. —The process by which the food is converted into chyme, has not been satisfactorily traced, nor has the existence of the lacteals for the absorption of the chyme been demonstrated. In this class of animals the veins seem to perform the offices both of lacteals and lymphatics. The blood is white, or rather of a bluish colour Its mechanical and chemical constitution yct remains to be investigated.

The circulating system of molluscous animals, exhibits very remarkable differences in the different classes.' In all of them, however, there is a systemic ventricle; but the other parts of the heart are not of constant occurrence.

The circulating system furnishes few characters which can be employed in systematical arrangements. The structure of the systemic and pulmonary vessels does not appear to be co-ordinate with any particular plan of external configuration and manner, as wc see in the case of the ptcropoda and gasteropoda. In these, the organs of circulation are very much alike, while the external Forms exhibit very obvious differences.

The molluscous animals which respire by means of lungs arc few in number, and form a very natural tribe, which Cuvier has termed gasterpodes pulmones. In them the respiratory organ is simple, consisting of a single cavity, on the walls of which the extremities of the pulmonary artery are spread. This cavity communicates externally by an aperture which the animal can open or shut at pleasure.

The mollusca which breathe by means of gills, exhibit very remarkable differences, in their number, structure, and position. In some cases, there is a single cavity communicating by an aperture, through which the water enters. The walls of this cavity exhibit an uneven surface, disposed in ridges, which are the gills, and on which the pulmonic artery is expanded. This structure exhibits itself in the Gasteropoda pcctini-branchia. In many cases the gills, though seated in a cavity, like the former, and equally exposed to the contact of the surrounding element, are two in number, one on each side, as in the Cephalopoda. In the Bivalvia, they are four in number, two on each side like leaves, and extend the whole length of the body. In these, the water is admitted at the pleasure of the animal.

The gills of other mollusca are seated externally, and consist either of aborescent productions, or simple cuticular elongations, within which the pulmonary artery terminates. In some of these, as the Pteropoda, the branchial surface is constantly exposed to the action of the surrounding water; whilst in others, the cuticular expansions, which are analogous to gills, are retractile at the will of the animal. In several examples, these cuticular elongations, which execute the functions of respiration, are covered with moveable cilia, well calculated to excite currents in the water, thus renewing the portions applied to the surface.

By means of the characters furnished by the circulating and respiratory systems, the molluscous animals may be divided into several distinct classes. But as we shall employ these characters in the construction of the different divisions to be employed, it is unnecessary, in this place, to enter into their details.

Peculiar secretions. —The molluscous animals are considered as destitute of organs for the production of urine, but they possess various organs for the secretion of peculiar fluids or solids, some of which are useful in the arts.

The coloured fluid, which is secreted by the Cephalopoda and some of the aquatic gasteropoda, appears to consist chiefly of a peculiar mucus, united to a peculiar pigment. The animals which furnish this secretion, eject it when in [7:15:328] danger or irritated, and thus envelope themselves in a dark cloud, and elude the pursuit of their foes. A milky secretion is poured forth over the surface of the skin of some slugs when irritated. Other coloured secretions may likewise be detected in the mollusca, to which we shall afterwards advert. The threadlike secretions, termed a byssus, with which some molluscous animals, especially among the Conchifera, fix themselves to other bodies, appear to be of an albuminous nature. A few species in this division have the power of secreting a luminous fluid. Its nature, and the organs in which it is elaborated, have not been investigated. It is probable that some animals, as those which have the faculty of raising or lowering themselves in the water, have likewise the power of secreting air into those organs which contribute to their buoyancy.

Morbid secretions likewise occur amongst the animals of this division, chiefly, however, amongst the Conchifera. The most important of these are pearls, so much prized as ornaments of dress.

The organs of generation, some of which will be noticed afterwards in detail, furnish many important characters for classification. The external openings are those which are detected with the greatest facility, but the structure of the internal organs exhibits more varied and discriminating marks.

Condition of the Mollusca —Molluscous animals, in reference to their condition, are divided, according to the situation in which they reside, into three groups, which may be termed terrestrial, fluviatile, and marine. Those that inhabit the land belong exclusively to the gasteropoda. Among these, some prefer open pastures, others the rubbish of old walls, while not a few reside in woods or among dead leaves and putrid plants. All the animals of this group respire by means of a pulmonary cavity.

The fluviatile mollusca, or such as reside in fresh waters, include not only many gasteropodous genera, but likewise a few belonging to the Conchifera. Amongst these, some breathe air by means of a pulmonary cavity, and come to the surface to respire. Such species frequent the more shallow ponds and lakes. Others, respiring by means of gills, are less dependent on the shallowness of the water, and consequently reside in different depths.

The marine mollusca include genera of all the classes. Some burrow in the sand, or adhere to the rocks which are left dry by the receding tide. These are termed littoral species. Others, however, which have been denominated pelagic, reside in the deep, and are seldom obtained but by dredging, or when thrown ashore during storms.

The effect of temperature in regulating the distribution of molluscous animals, has not been investigated with any degree of care or success. Over the terrestrial and fluviatile species, it probably exercises a very powerful control, greatly limiting their geographical range. In proof of this, it may be stated, that the south of France possesses several species not to be found in England, whilst in England, there arc a few which have not been detected in Scotland. But, among the marine mollusca, the influence of climate is not felt in the same degree. Living in an element, the bulk and motions of which guard it equally from the extremes of heat or cold, these animals, like the sea-weeds, have a very extensive latitudinal and longitudinal range. Thus, some are common to Greenland and the Mediteιτanean, others to Britain and the West Indies. The mollusca of the tropical seas, however, differ widely as a whole from those of the temperate regions. Some of the forms appear to be peculiar to warm regions, and, in general, the intensity of colour decreases as we approach the poles. But as there have been few cultivators of this branch of science, the geographical distribution of the species has been but imperfectly explored. Few parts of either England or Scotland have been surveyed by the eye of the helminthologist, so that many species, the range of which is considered as limited, may soon be found to be extensive.

If the observations are few and imperfect, which have been made on the influence of temperature, in regülating the physical distribution of mollusca, we are still in greater ignorance with regard to the power of habit. In the floe¢z rocks, the relics of marine and fluviatile mollusca are found mixed in the same bed. This circumstance gave rise to the inquiry, how far the mollusca of fresh water can be habituated to sea-water, and vice versa. In the account of the proceedings of the National Institute of France, for the year 1816, it is stated, that Μ. Beuchant, professor at Marseilles, has directed his attention to this subject. He found, that all these animals die immediately, ifwe suddenly change their place of abode; but that, if we gradually increase the proportion of salt in the water for the one set, and diminish it for the other set, we can, in general, accustom them to live in a kind of water which is not natural to them. He found, however, some species which resisted these attempts, and which could not bear any alteration in the quality of the water in which they reside. Before much confidence can be placed in the accuracy of these results, it would be desirable that the experiments were repeated and varied by other observers. There are, indeed, many sources of error to be guarded against. When we change animals from fresh to salt water, or from salt water to fresh, we must necessarily derange their motions, by compelling them to reside in a medium of a different degree of density from the one in which they have been accustomed to dwell, and to which the arrangement of the different parts of the body is adapted. By such a change of place, it would be difficult for those which breathe air to come to the surface, and descend again in their new situation. In those with gills, the application of a new kind of fluid to the surface of such delicate organs, would considerably influence the function of respiration. The change of situation would likewise be accompanied by a corresponding change of food, and consequently, not merely the organs of locomotion and respiration, but likewise those of digestion, would suffer a derangement in their operations. We know that the power c£suffering in the animals of this class is very great, and that they survive, though sadly mutilated. Some of the snails will live in a quiescent state for years, without food, and almost without air. Unless, therefore, the animals subjected to these experiments of a change of situation, have been observed to thrive on the food which it spontaneously yields, to execute their accustomed motions, and above all, to propagate their kind, we shall be disposed to conclude, that patient suffering Iras been mistaken for health and vivaciousness for the power of accommodation. ,

The influence of the seasons, in regulating the motions and habits of molluscous animals, has been but little attended to. Those which live in the water, avoid the effects of low temperature, on the approach of winter, by retiring to the deeper parts of the lakes or rivers in which they reside. This migration, however, does not, in many cases, furnish the requisite security, so that they betake themselves to burrowing in the mud in which they repose until increasing warmth invites them to return to the open water.

Among the naked terrestrial mollusca, it may be observed, that they burrow in holes of the earth, under the roots of trees or among moss, and there screen themselves from sudden changes of temperature, and appear to spend the winter in a state of torpidity.

The different kinds of shelly mollusca which inhabit the land, such as those belonging to the genera Helix, Bulimus, and Pupa, not only retire to crevices of rocks and other places, for safety in the winter season, but they form an operculum or lid for the mouth of the shell, calculated to exclude the access of the air, and by the intervention of which they likewise adhere to the wall of their dwelling. A [7:15:329] rise of temperature, however, especially if accompanied by moisture, excites their revival and motion, and the lid becomes detached. If we bring, for example, the Helix nemoralis, from its cold abode, and in an apparently torpid state, with the mouth of its shell closed by the lid and adhering to a stone, into a warm apartment, it will speedily revive, especially if it be moistened with a little water, burst open the lid and begin to crawl. If the animal be again exposed to a low temperature, it again secretes materials for a new lid, and speedily returns to its slumbers or inactivity. The first formed opercula, in these animals, always contain a considerable proportion of carbonate of lime, a material which is found in smaller quantity in those of after formation. If the animal has revived frequently during the winter, the last formed opercula will be observed to consist chiefly of animal matter, and to be very thin. The first formed winter lid of the Helix Pomatia is of the consistence of card-paper.

All the land shelly mollusca appear tc⅛have the power of passing into a state of quiescence resembling torpidity, at pleasure, and independent of low temperature. Thus, even in midsummer, if we place in a box specimens of the Helix hortensis, nemoralis aut arbustorum, without food, in a day or two they form for themselves a thin operculum, become attached to the Side of the box, and assume a dormant condition. In this state of apparent torpidity they may be kept for several years. No ordinary change of temperature produces any effect upon them, but they speedily revive if moistened or plunged in water. Even in their natural haunts, they arc often found in this dormant state, during the summer season, especially when there is a continued drought. Thus the Helix nemoralis may frequently be observed several feet from the ground, and attached to the stem or leaves of plants, with the mouth of the shell closed.

But it is not drought which influences these terrestrial shelly mollusca to assume this quiescent state. The Succineα putris, a species in ordinary cases delighting in moisture, may readily be observed during summer in a dormant state, high on the leaves of the Water Flag, having retired from the moisture below. In the same manner, and from causes equally obscure, some of the marine shelly mollusca, as the Limpet, Periwinkle, and Trochus, may be observed in a quiescent state on the rocks, above the reach of the tide. A shower, however, in general excites the Succinea, as well as the Limpets and Periwinkles, to motion.

CHAP. II PROGRESS OF THE SCIENCE.

Naturalists have pursued a variety of methods in their examination of this important branch of Zoology, and have proposed systems of arrangement founded on very different principles, and marking different epochs in the science. In the methodical distribution observed by some, the form of the shelly covering has been exclusively attended to, while the organization of the animal itself has been overlooked, or even disregarded. A few have made the habits of the animal, the groundwork of their system. Others have passed over the characters exhibited by the forms and structure of the shell, and have confined their attention exclusively to the form and structure of the contained animal. Lastly, there have been a few, who, embracing all the circumstances connected with the shell, the animal, and its habits, have constructed systems at once natural and convenient. In the following sections we propose to consider these four classes into V. Inch the cultivators of this department of science may be distributed.

Sect. I.— Systems constructed from circumstances connected with the characters of the Shell.

1 he arrangement of the testaceous mollusca, according to the different forms of the shell, is unquestionably the most obvious and the most ancient method. It was first employed by Aristotle, the father of natural history, and even in the present day its admirers are warm in its praiseι It is with great propriety termed the artificial method, because the , characters employed have but a remote relation to the more important functions of the animal. This eminent philosopher had the merit of forming the great divisions of univalves and bivalves. He likewise separated the turbinated univalves from such as have but an imperfect spire, and formed many genera, or rather families, still retaining the names which he imposed.

The progress of the study of the shelly mollusca (the naked kinds being in a great measure neglected,) made very little progress for many ages after Aristotle had published his method of arrangement. Indeed, the first work of this sort which claims attention, is the Dictionarium Ostracolo-gicum of Major, which was published in 1675. To him we are indebted for the threefold division of shells into univalves, bivalves, and multivalves, and for an explanation of the terms then employed by conchologists.

In the same career, but with more brilliant success, Languis followed, and, in 1722, published his Methodus Nova Testacea Marina in suas Classes, Genera ct Species distribuendi. The following character is given of this work by the intelligent and industrious authors of the Historical Account of Testaceological Writers. {Linn. Trans, vol. vii. p. 156.) ζζ After having noticed a multitude of mere describers, wc now come to an author who is not undeserving of the title of a scientific one, and whose system, so far as marine testacea are concerned, (and of these alone he treats) certainly glances at the great clue to simplicity, which was afterwards so successfully and admirably seized by the great reformer of natural history in general.” But Langius deserves more praise than is here bestowed upon him. Before his system appeared, the characters of the genera depended principally on the outline, and were of uncertain application. He remedied the defect, by directing the attention of conchologists to the form of the mouth in univalves, and to the structure of the hinge in bivalves. Among the former, he constituted subdivisions of those ore sτιperius aperto, ore superius in canaliculum abeunte, and ore superius clauso. Amongst the latter, the circumstance did not escape him, that some of these shells are equivalve, others inequivalve ; some equilateral, others inequilateral. Hence he may be considered as the founder of the inferior divisions of the artificial method, and as having furnished, to modern conchologists, manyuseful hints, of which they have availed themselves, without, however, acknowledging their origin.

Another important improvement was effected by Brey-nius Dissertatio Physica de Polythalamiis, 1732, in 4to.

This consisted in separating from the ordinary univalves, such shells as possess a cavity divided by partitions into several compartments, and in forming them into a division, which he termed Polythalamium. These shells arc now called Mnltilocular.

The system of Tournefort, which was published by Gualtieri, in his Index Testarum Conchyliorum quae adservantur in Musaeo Nicolai Gualtieri, Philosophi et Medici, Florentini, 1742, well deserves an attentive perusal. In his observations on the bivalves, now denominated the acephalous mollusca, he drew the attention of conchologists to an important character, and one of easy application, having observed that, in some genera, the valves do not close or unite all round, but that, at certain places, the shell remains in part open. Such shells, in modern language, are said to gαρe-

The system of the celebrated Linnaeüs, which ought nowto be mentioned, is too well known in this country to deserve particular notice. In many of the other departments [7:15:330] of Zoology he effected the most important alterations; but his attempts to reform the science of conchology, were far from being equally successful. To the subject he never was much attached, nor does he appear to have availed himself sufficiently of the labours of those authors whom we have mentioned, and of others who preceded him. The ' primary divisions which he employed, were those which Major had established, and his genera, with a few exceptions, were those in common use. His merit as a conchologist rests entirely on the accurately defined terms, the concise specific characters, and the convenient trivial names which he employed and introduced. The particular consideration of the Linnaean genera, and the subsequent changes which have been introduced into them, will form the subject of a separate section.

For some time after the publication of the Systema Nα-turae, the illustrious Swede enjoyed a very dangerous reputation. All his arrangements were regarded as of such high authority, that it was considered as impious to attempt to introduce any change; so that conchology, and along with it the study of the mollusca, according to the artificial method, remained a long time stationary. At last in France, a country which refused to submit to the fetters of the Linnaean school, several new systems were proposed, which had for their object the restoration of those well-founded genera, which Linnaeus, in his too great desire to simplify, had suppressed, and the accommodation of the divisions of the science to those new relations which a more extensive knowledge of species had discovered. In this number Bose stands eminently conspicuous. In his work entitled Histoire Naturelle des Coquilles, des Vers et des Crustaces, and in the conchological articles of the Dictionnaire T Histoire Naturelle, he has favoured the world with a detail of his system, the outline of which we shall here present to our readers:

In this system which we have exhibited, the arrangement is more methodical, and the genera are more definite, than in the Linnaean system. It unquestionably holds the first rank in the modern artificial methods.

There is a class of writers whose labours deserve some notice in tlιis place. We allude to those who have devoted their attention to the very minute shells, so common among the sand on every sea-coast. These are too small to be examined by the naked eye, and from the instrument employed in their investigation, they are usually termed Microscopic Shells. Plancus, in his work, De Conchis Ariminensibus minus notis, published in 1739, may be considered as the first who drew the attention of conchologists to these nearly invisible objects. J. F. Hoffman, in his Dissertαti-uncula de Cornu Amrnonis nativo Littoris Bergensis in Norvegiα, published in the Transactions of the Electoral Academy of Mentz, 1757, and in his essay de Tubulis Veτ-micularibus Cornu Ammonis referentibus, ibid. 1761, made us acquainted with various species of minute nautili produced on the northern shores. Nor did those discoveries fail to excite interest in this country. Boys and Walker devoted their attention to the subject, and gave to the world the result of their labours, in a thin quarto, entitled, Testacea Minuta rariora nuperrime detecta in arena littoris Sandvicensis, London, 1784. Other observers, equally ardent and successful, have increased our knowledge of the forms of these minute bodies, particularly Soldant, who, in his Testaceog raphia ac Zoophytographia parva et microscopica, 1789 and 1795, exhibited many figures of the mi- - nute shells of Portoferrara, &c. Mr. Adams likewise described the minute species which he observed on the coast of Pembrokeshire, in the third and fifth volumes of the Transactions of the Linnaean Society of London, and other species of British growth have been investigated by the author of Testacea Britannica. We shall close this list with noticing the Testacea Microscopica attaque minuta ex generibus Argonauta ct Nautilus ad Naturam Picta et Descripta, Vienna, 1798. Itis the joint production of L. A. Fichel and J. P. C. A. Moll, and merits an attentive perusal.

We are aware that such microscopie investigations are regarded by some conchologists as useless, so that the minute species are excluded from their systems. But it is surely a strange method of proceeding in natural history, to judge of the merits or importance of species from their size. It is true that we are still ignorant of the inhabitants of those shells, and may long continue to be so; but our present knowledge of these shells has enabled us to fill up many blanks, to perceive several new relations, and even to draw some important conclusions.
[7:15:331]

That this sort of inquiry has in many instances been injudiciously conducted, all who are acquainted with the subject must admit. Due care has not been taken to distinguish these minute testacea from the fry of the larger shells, so that the number of species has been very injudiciously multiplied. These remarks apply to several figures of Walker, and to a still greater number of those of Adams.

Sect. II— Systems constructed from Circumstances connected with the Habits of the Animal.

The authors of the preceding class have laboured to bring to perfection the artificial system of conchology, and have formed their arbitrary characters, independent of the habits of life of the contained animal. But the naturalists whom we have now to consider, have traced these animals to their lurking places, and arranged them according to the situation in which they reside, instead of the forms which they exhibit.

At the head of this class of conchologists, Dr. Martin Lister stands pre-eminently conspicuous. His great work, entitled Historia sive Synopsis Methodica Conchyliorum, was begun in 1685, and completedin 1692. It will long remain a monument of the extensive information and unwearied diligence of its author. The following synoptical view of the work will enable our readers to comprehend its plan; the original should be consulted with care.

Lib. i. De Cochleis terrestribus.

Pars 1. De Buccinis terrestribus.

Pars 2. Cochleae nudae terrestres Limaces quibusdam dictae.

Lib. ii. De Turbinibus et bivalvibus aquae dulcis.

Pars 1. De Turbinibus.

Pars 2. De Testaceis bivalvibus fluviatilibus.

Lib. iii. De Testaceis bivalvibus marinis.

Pars 1. De Testaceis bivalvibus, imparibus testis.

Pars 2. De Testaceis bivalvibus, paribus testis.

Pars 3. De Testaceis multivalvibus.

Lib. iv. De Buccinis marinis, quibus etiam vermiculi, dentalia et patellae numerantur.

The plan followed by Sir Robert Sibbald in his Scotia Illustrata is somewhat different from that of Lister. He divides the Testacea into two classes, land and water shells, and the latter class he subdivides into fluviatile and marine. His inferior divisions are destitute of precision, and the number of species referred to limited.

The system of D’Argenville, which was so much esteemed and so long followed in France, is essentially the same with that of Lister in the higher divisions. The plan is indeed so simple, and in appearance so natural, that it has met with many admirers. It has even been useful in encouraging naturalists to study particular departments of the science, when they were prevented by their situation from devoting their attention to the whole. It is probably to this circumstance that we are indebted to Schröter for his observations on the land shells in the neighbourhood of Thangelstadt, and on the river shells of Thuringia.

The preceding arrangements, formed according to the situations in which the animals reside, and not according to their external coverings, may be considered as the first attempts at a natural method in conchology. They serve, as an introduction to a new class of authors, whose views may be considered as of a higher order, and to whose labours we shall devote our attention in the following section.

Sect. HI.— Systems constructed from Circumstances connected with the Form and Structure of the contained Animal.

The first attempt of any consequence to arrange testaceous animals according to the soft parts of their bodies, was made by Adanson, in his Histoire Naturelle du Sénégal, published at Paris in 1757. In this system, the ancient classes of Univalves, Bivalves, and Multivalves, are employed under the titles les Limaçons, les Conques, and les Conques Multivalves. Classe I. Les Limaçons.

Sect. I. Les Limaçons Univalves.

Fam. 1. Les limaçons univalves qui n’ont ni yeux ni cornes.

Fam. 2. Les limaçons univalves qui ont deux cornes, et les yeux placés à leur racine et sur leur côte interne.

Fam. 3. Les limaçons univalves qui ont quatres cornes, dont les deux extérieurs portent les yeux sur le sommet.

Fam. 4. Les limaçons univalves, qui ont deux cornes et les yeux placés à leur racine, et sur le côte externe, ou pas derrière.

Fam. 5. Les limaçons univalves qui ont deux cornes et les yeux posés un peu au dessus de leur racine et sur leur côte externe.

Sect. II. Les Limaçons Operculés.

Fam. 1. Limaçons operculés qui ont deux cornes, avec un renflement, et qui portent les yeux ordinairement au dessus de leur racine, et à leur côte externe.

Fam. 2. Limaçons operculés qui ont deux cornes sans renflement, et les yeux placés à leur racine, et sur leur côte externe.

Fam. 3. Limaçons operculés qui ont quatres cornes, dont les deux extérieurs portent les yeux sur leur sommet.

Classe II. Les Conques Bivalves.

Fam. 1. Les conques bivalves qui ont les deux lobes du manteaux séparés dans tout leur contour.

Fam. 2. Les conques bivalves dont les deux lobes du manteau forment trois ouvertures sans aucun tuyau.

Fam. 3. Les conques bivalves dont les deux lobes du manteau forment trois ouvertures, dont deux prennent la figure d’un tuyau assez long.

The presence or absence of an operculum or lid, gives rise, in this system, to a division of the univalves into two sections, and the families are established from circumstances connected with the number of the tentacula, and the number and position of the eyes. The families amongst the bivalves are arranged according to the structure of their cloak or external covering. In the class of multivalves, which we have omitted in the table, the characters are taken from the form and structure of the shell.

The work of Geoffroy, entitled, Traité Sommaire des Coquilles tant fluviatiles que terrestres, qui se trouvent aux environs de Paris, 1767, is constructed upon the principles of Adanson. Here, however, the objects were not sufficiently numerous to admit of all the subdivisions of that author, but he has made the form of the animal subservient to the construction of generic characters.

After these attempts to classify the animals which inhabit shells had been made in France, the celebrated zoologist of Denmark, O. F. Müller, turned his attention to the same subject. In the Zoologia Danica, which contains his digested views of the subject, he employs, in the construction of his genera of univalves, the characters first used by Adanson; but among the bivalves, besides the form of the tubes or syphon, he notices the construction of the branchiae and the presence or absence of a foot.

To our knowledge of the animals which inhabitbivalves, Poli, in his expensive work, Ú\e History of the Shells of the Two Sicilies, made very important additions. In the construction of his families, which are six in number, he employs merely the characters furnished by the syphon and foot. In the first family the animal has two syphons and a foot; in the second, there [7:15:332] is only one syphon and foot; in the third, a syphon and no feet; in the fourth there is an abdominal syphon and no feet; in the fifth there is a foot but no syphon; while, in the sixth, neither foot nor syphon can be discovered. In the formation of his genera, Poli takes advantage of the various forms of the cloak and the branchiae.

To the celebrated Cuvier, the conchologist is also under tlιc greatest obligations. By applying his vast knowledge of anatomy to the examination of the molluscous animals, he has unfolded many new conformations of parts, and exhibited many unlooked-for relations. The vast collection of objects, the spoils of all the museums of the continent, which Paris once possessed, lay open to his inspection, and his industry appears to have been equal to the harvest which invited him to labour.

In his first attempts to classify the molluscous animals, as contained in his TableauElémentairc de ll Histoire Naturelle desAnimαux (1798); and his Leçons d ’ Anatomie Comparce, (1800-1805), he employed chiefly the characters which the preceding writers had developed, in his inferior divisions; but in his primary distinctions, he distributed the mollusca into three classes: Cephalopoda, having the head covered with tentacula, serving as feet; Gasteropoda, with the head free, the animal crawling on the belly; and Acephala, having no distinct head.

Some years after the appearance of this classification, Cuvier directed more of his attention to the internal structure of the mollusca, and, by means of accurate dissections, obtained a more intimate acquaintance with the organs and functions of these animals than any of his predecessors had acquired. The information which he thus gained was communicated to the public at different periods, in the well-known publication Annales du Museum d ’ Histoire Naturelle de Paris. These papers, with some additional observations, were at last published in a separate form, under the title Mémoires pour servir a l i histoirc et à V Anatomie des Mollusques, Paris, 1816. In the following year he published Le Règne Animal, distribué d’après son organisation, in which he arranged the mollusca according to his peculiar views, from characters drawn exclusively from the animal. In the third volume, of what may be termed the third edition of that invaluable work, published in 1830, the same arrangement, with the exception of a few modifications, was adhered to.

He divides the mollusca into six classes, which he terms Cephalopoda, Pteropoda, Gasteropoda, Acephala, Brachiopoda, and Cirrhipoda.

In the class Cephalopoda, the body is in the form of a sack, open above, containing the branchiae, with a distinct head, surrounded by fleshy elongations or arms, adapted for moving the body or seizing prey. Into this class, along with the Sepia of Linnaeus, Cuvier has inserted the multilocular shells of his genus Nautilus and the genus Argonauta. But it is to be feared, that our knowledge of the testaceous mollusca which inhabit the numerous multilocular shells, is too limited to enable us to assign to all of them their true place in a natural arrangement of animals.

In the second class, termed Pteropoda, the body is closed, the head is destitute of the long fleshy arms which distinguish the animals of the preceding division; two fin-like membranes, situate.on the sides of the neck, and on which the branchial tissue is in general spread, serve as organs of motion. There is only one shelly mollusca belonging to this class, viz., the anomia tridentata of Forskaehl, now forming a part of the genus hyaloea.

The third class, which includes a great number of naked and testaceous mollusca, and to which Cuvier gives the name Gasteropoda, from the circumstance of the belly being formed for crawling, has been subdivided into eight orders, from circumstances connected with the organs of respiration.

In the first order, termed Pulmones, which breathe air, he has constituted two divisions, the terrestrial and the aquatic. The animals of the former live on land, and were included by Linnaeus in his genera limax and turbo. They are the land shells of most authors. Those of the division, termed aquatic, live in the water, but require at intervals to come to the surface to obtain fresh air. They constitute, with a few exceptions, the fresh water shells of naturalists. In the second and third orders, or Nudibranches and lnfero-branches, the species consist almost entirely of genera formed from the animals which Linnaeus and many others included in the genus doris. They are naked mollusca, and are likewise destitute of any internal testaceous plate. The fourth order, termed Tectibranches, contains animals whose branchiae, like small leaves more or less divided, are situate on the right side, or upon the back. The animals of this division possess a shell, but it is in general placed beneath the common integuments, such as the genus Aplysia and several species of the genus Eulla. The fifth order, termed Heter-οpodcs, have the gills plumore and dorsal, with the foot compressed and vertical like a fin, with a small portion of it only formed to act as an organ of adhesion, as in the other gasteropoda. The Pectinibranches form the sixth order, and are distinguished by the branchiae, which are like leaves or threads placed parallel in one, two, or three lines, on the surface of the pulmonary cavity, and by having the sexes separate. It includes the whole of the marine species of the Linnaean genera of turbinated univalves. Into this order, Cuvier, from the consideration of other characters, has inserted the genus Cyclostoma, which, according to the characters indicated by the respiratory organs, belongs to the Pulmones.

In the seventh order, termed Scuiibr anches, the branchiae are similar to those of the preceding order, but the sexes are united, each individual being capable of impregnating or being impregnated. The shells in general are cup-shaped, and destitute of a lid. It includes the genus Halyotis, and many species of the old genus Patella. In the last order, called Cyclobranches, the branchiae appear in the form of small leaves or pyramids strung round the under margin of the cloak. They enjoy a hermaphroditism similar to those of the preceding order. The species of the genus Patella which are allied to the vulgata, and the genus Chiton, are included in this order.

In the fourth class, or Acephλt,a, he includes the bivalve shells, distributing them into families, from characters nearly similar to those which we have pointed out as having been previously employed by Poli.

The fifth class, termed Brachiopoda, contains animals, resembling those of the preceding class in having a cloak of two lobes, but these are always open. The branchiae consist of small leaves placed on the inner margin of each lobe. In place of a foot they have two retractile fleshy arms, which are extensile. This class includes the Patella unguis of Linnaeus, the genus Terebratula and the Patella anomala of Müller.

The class Cirrhipoda, distinguished by the articulated filaments with which the animals are furnished, contains the species of the genus Lepas of Linnaeus. The shells belonging to the Linnaean genera Sarpula and Dentalium, are transferred to the class termed Annelides.

This system of the molluscous animals is unquestionably the most perfect of all those which have been published. But, with all its excellence, we must inform the reader, that many species, nay, whole genera, have their places assigned them in this natural method, merely because the shells occupied a similar position in the artificial system, the form of the inhabitants being unknown.

Section IV— Mixed Systems.

In this section, we shall confine our remarks to the only [7:15:333] system of this kind of any consequence which has hitherto appeared, and which is the production of the late industrious Lamark, one of the most celebrated zoologists of the French school. The Système des Animaux sans Vertèbres, Paris, 1801, of this author, embraces the whole range of animals included in the classes Insectaand Vermes of Linnaeus. Where treating of the Mollusca he divides them into two orders. The first, termed Cephαlous, from possessing a head, includes the univalves. The second, termed Acephalous, from the absence of a head, includes the bivalves. This eminent author greatly modified his views, as appears from what he announced in his Extrait du Cours de Zoologie, Paris, 1812, the prelude to his last and great work, Histoire Naturelle des Animaux sans Vertèbres, the fifth, sixth, and seventh volumes of which refer to the Mollusca, he fortunately lived to finish between the years 1818 and 1822. The arrangement adopted in this invaluable work, has been greatly admired, a circumstance which induces us to give the following synoptical view of its contents. '

The species considered by the older naturalists as shells and mollusca, are in this system of Lamark distributed into three great divisions or classes, which he has denominated Cikrπipeda, Conchiferae, and Mollusca. These classes he has subdivided according to the following tabular view:
