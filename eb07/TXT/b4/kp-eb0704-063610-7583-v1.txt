BIELFELD, a circle in the Prussian government of Minden, and province of Westphalia. It extends over 110 square miles, or 70,400 acres; contains one city, one market-town, five parishes, and sixteen hamlets; and is peopled by 31,840 persons. It is mostly of a poor soil, and chiefly produces hemp and flax, with but little corn. It is, however, the chief seat of the weaving and bleaching of Ravensburg linens. The principal place is the city of the same name, on the river Luther. It was fortified, but the walls have been converted into a pleasing promenade. It contains one Catholic, one Calvinist, and two Lutheran churches, an orphan-house and an hospital, 782 dwellings, and 7254 inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in various branches of the linen trade. More than 2,000,000 ells are sold in the place yearly. Long. 18. 23. 8. E. Lat. 52. 1. 9. N.
