BARRICADE, or Barricado, a military term for a fence formed in haste with vessels, baskets of earth, trees, palisades, or the like, to serve as a defence against the shot or assault of the enemy. The most usual materials for barricades consist of pales or stakes, crossed with batoons, shod with iron at the feet, and usually set up in passages or breaches.

Barricade, in Naval Architecture, a strong wooden rail, supported by stanchions, extending across the foremost part of the quarter-deck. In a ship-of-war the vacant spaces between the stanchions are commonly filled with rope-mats, cork, or pieces of old cable; and the upper part, which contains a double rope-netting above the rail, is stuffed with hammocks to intercept the flight, and to prevent the execution, of small-shot in time of action. ,
