BOLSCHERETSK, a town and fortress of Kamtschatka, formerly the capital of that peninsula, and the seat of the government. It is situated on the river Bolschaia RÃ©ka, 20 miles from its mouth, in an extensive plain stretching along the sea-shore. It was built in 1701, and was designed as a depot of Russian commerce; but, from the difficulty of navigating the river, and the insecurity of the harbour, the seat of government was transferred to Nis-chery Kamtschatka, at a considerable distance; and the town has since fallen to decay. Long. 157. E. Lat. 53. N.
