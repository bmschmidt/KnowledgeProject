BERNINI, John Laurence, commonly called Cavalier βerηiη, a Neapolitan, remarkable for his skill in painting, sculpture, architecture, and mechanics. He first began to be known under the pontificate of Paul V., and Rome is indebted to this artist for some of its greatest ornaments. He died at Rome in 1680.
