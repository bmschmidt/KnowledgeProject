BOGLIPOOR, a town of Hindostan, in the province of Bahar, and chief town of the district of the same name, about two miles from the main branch of the Ganges. It has a Mahommedan college, and two very singular round towers, about a mile north-west of the town, which are considered sacred. The inhabitants of this district, which is mountainous, were in a state of barbarism till about the year 1780, when Mr Cleveland, the British judge and collector, introduced civilization among them; he raised a batallion of these highlanders, consisting of 300 men, who now protect the territory which they formerly used to desolate.
