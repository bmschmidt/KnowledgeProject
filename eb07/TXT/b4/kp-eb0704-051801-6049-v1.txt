BED WIN, Great, a borough, formerly also a markettown, of the hundred of Kinwardstone, in the county of Wilts. It is seventy miles from London, on the Kennet and Avon canal. It returns two members to the house of commons, who are nominally chosen by the holders of burgage tenures, but in reality by Lord Aylesbury. The number of inhabitants in 1801 amounted to 1632, in 1811 to 1851, and in 1821 to 1928.
