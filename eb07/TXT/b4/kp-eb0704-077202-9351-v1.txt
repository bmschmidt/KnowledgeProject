BONNEVAL, Claude Alexander, Count de, known in the latter part of his life by the name of Achmet Pasha, descended from an illustrious family ^of Limousin, was born on the 14th July 1675, entered himself at the age of sixteen in the service of the crown, and married the daughter of Marshal de Biron. He distinguished himself at the combats of Dieppe, La Hogue, and Cadiz, where Marshal de Tourville commanded the French fleet; and he made the campaign of Flanders in 1690. But he soon after left the French army, and, entering into the imperial service under Prince Eugene, signalized himself greatly on several occasions, particularly at the battle of Peterwaradin, where the victory was due in a great measure to his intrepidity, and to the resistance which his regiment opposed to a numerous corps of Janissaries. The intrigues of the Marquis de Prie, however, ruined his credit at the court of Vienna, and caused him to be banished the empire. He then offered his services to the republic of Venice and to Russia; and these being declined in both instances, his next tender was to the Grand Signior, who gladly received him. It was stipulated that he should have a body of 30,000 men at his disposal; that a government should be conferred on him, with the rank of pasha of three tails, and a salary of 10,000 aspers a-day; and that, in the event of war, he should be commander-in-chief. The first expedition he engaged in after his arrival at Constantinople, was to quell an insurrection in Arabia Petraea, which he happily effected; and on his return he had large offers made him by Kouli Khan, but he did not choose to accept them. Some time after, he commanded the Turkish army against the emperor, over whose forces he gained a victory on the banks of the Danube. But success does not always protect a commander from disgrace; for Bonneval, notwithstanding his services, was first imprisoned, and then banished to the island of Chio. .The sultan, however, continued his friènd; and, the evening before his departure, made him pasha of the Archipelago, which, with his former appointment of beglierbey of Arabia, rendered him one of the most powerful persons in the Ottoman empire. In this island he found a retirement quite agreeable to his wishes, but did not long enjoy it, being sent for back, and made topidgee or master of the ordnance, a post of great honour and profit. He died in 1747, at the age of seventy-four. Some doubts have been expressed as to the authenticity of the Mémoires du Comte de Bonneval, which bear to be the production of this singular man, and are unquestionably in many respects highly interesting. The best edition is that of London (Lausanne) 1740-55, in 5 vols. 12mo.

- BONONCINI, Giovanni Maria, of Modena, an eminent musical composer, who for some time divided the opinions of the conoscenti in this kingdom, respecting his merits as compared with Handel. An Italian opera, entitled Pharnaces, has the name of Bononcini prefixed to it; but whether the words, or only the music, be his composition, is uncertain. Bononcini is, however, the undisputed author of a work entitled ll Musico Pratico, or the Practical Musician, which he published in 1673, and dedicated to the emperor Leopold. ¶
