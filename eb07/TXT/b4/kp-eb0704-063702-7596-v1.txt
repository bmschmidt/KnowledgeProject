BIFRONS, a person double-fronted, or two-faced. Bi-frοηs is more peculiarly an appellation of Janus, who was represented by the ancients with two faces, because he was supposed to look both backwards and forwards; though other reasons for this mode of delineation are mentioned by Plutarch. Sometimes he was painted with four faces, quadrifrons, as regarding the four seasons.
