BISZTRITZ, a district or circle in the Hungarian province of the Seven Mountains. It extends over 1025 square miles, or 656,000 acres, and contains one city and fifty-five villages. It is an elevated tract of land, forming a part of the range of the Carpathian Mountains, through which is the pass of Rodna into Buckovina. The climate is generally severe, and the summers late; but it produces corn, flax, and fuel, and industry is applied to the rearing of black-cattle. It is thinly inhabited. The capital, the only town, bears the same name. It contains several churches for the different sects, a provincial Latin school or gymnasium, 765 houses, and 4850 inhabitants. Long. 24. 26. 13. E. Lat. 47. 5. 46. N.
