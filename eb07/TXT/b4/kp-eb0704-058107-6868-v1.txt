BEREZOV, a Russian town of Siberia, on the river Soswa, 18 miles from its confluence with the Obi. It contains three churches and a chapel. Its northern situation forbids all kind of agricultural industry; hence the inhabitants subsist on rein-deer, as also by hunting and fishing; and the furs which they procure are exchanged with the Russian merchants for such articles as they require. They also supply Tobolsk and other places on the Irtisch with dried fish in summer, and with frozen fish during winter. The inhabitants are chiefly Cossacks, and much addicted to drinking. Berezov is 598 miles N. N. W. of Tobolsk. Lat. 64. N.
