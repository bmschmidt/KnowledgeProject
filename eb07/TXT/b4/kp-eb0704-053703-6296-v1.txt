BEEMAH, a river of HinÄ‘ostan, which has its rise in the mountains to the north of Poonah, not many miles from the source of the Godavery. It passes within thirty miles of the town of Poonah, where it is called Bewrah, and is esteemed by the Hindoos a sacred river. It is one of the principal tributaries of the Krishna, which it joins near the town of Firozegur, in the province of Beeder. The length of its course, including its windings, may be 400 miles.
