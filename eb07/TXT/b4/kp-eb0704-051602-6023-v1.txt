BEDFORD, the capital town of the county of that name. It stands on the river Ouse, fifty miles from London. It has five parish churches and several separatist chapels, a well-endowed and well-managed free school, and a number of benevolent institutions for the indigent. It is governed by a corporate body, and returns two members to the house of commons, who are elected by a numerous body of freemen, but so far influenced by the Duke of Bedford and Mr Whitbread as to secure a majority when their interests are united. The town is remarkably clean and well paved. The markets are held on Saturday for corn, and on Tuesday for cattle. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 3948, in 1811 to 4605, and in 1821 to 5466.
