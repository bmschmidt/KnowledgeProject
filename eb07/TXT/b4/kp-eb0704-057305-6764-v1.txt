BENTINCK, William Henry Cavendish, third duke of Portland, was born on the 14th of April 1738. Having finished his education at Christ Church, Oxford, he went on his travels. Soon after his return he was elected for the borough of Weobly, in the first parliament of the king’s reign. For this borough, however, he did not sit long; for, on the death of his father, on the 1st of May 1762, he was called up to the house of peers. He immediately joined the opposition; and, in 1763, his name is found among the minority against the cider bill, and along with that of the duke of Grafton in a pro’test against it. The next session he also signed a protest on the motion to vote away the privilege claimed by members of parliament in matters of libel. In 1765, when his friend the marquis' of Rockingham came into power, he was appointed lord chamberlain, and he retired when the marquis went out of office. In 1768 there was a violent contest for the county of Cumberland; and as the duke warmly supported the two opposition candidates, the ministry, in order to weaken his influence, and at the same time to increase that of Sir James Lowther, who was one of the ministerial candidates, granted to the latter Inglewood forest, an extensive and valuable estate, which had been granted by King William III. to the first duke of Portland, and had remained in possession of that family ever since. The new grant was made in consequence of a report from the surveyor-gene··

ral of erown lands, that the premises were not comprised in the original grant from King W’illiam to the duke of Portland, but were still vested in the erown. A letter was written from the treasury, directing the duke to prepare his title, and assuring him that nothing should be deeided concerning the grant till such title had been stated and maturely considered: but while his graee’s agents were busily employed in their researches and inquiries, he received a seeond letter, informing him that the grants were passed and the leases signed. A eaveat had been entered at the exchequer to stop the progress of the grant; but when Lord North was prayed to withhold affixing the exchequer seal, he replied that, as chancellor of the exchequer, he was bound to obey the orders of the treasury. On the 19th of November 1771 this great cause was tried before the barons of the exchequer in Westminster Hall. The court reeited all the records and prerogatives of the crown, from Edward I. to the lease made to Sir James Lowther; when, after a full and impartial examination of the said lease, it was found invalid, agreeably to the statute of the 1st of Anne, whieh expressly requires that, upon every grant from the crown, there shall be a reserved rent, not under the third part of the elear yearly value of the manors, lands, &c. as shall be contained in the grant. Sir James Lowther’s grant from the erown, being only a quit-rent of 13s. 4d. for the whole of Inglewood forest, was immediately determined by the eourt an inadequate third proportion, and he was nonsuited aeeordingly. The. nullum tempus bill, or the aet for quieting the possessions of the subjeet against all pretenees of concealment whatsoever, which was brought into parliament in 1768, and passed in the following year, owed its rise to this grant of the Portland property to Sir James Lowther.

In 1766 the duke of Portland had been bound more closely than ever to the Roękingham party, in eonsequence of his marriage with Lady Dorothy Cavendish, sister to the duke of Devonshire. On the resignation of Lord North he was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland; and during his government the parliament of that eountry was declared independent of the British parliament. After an administration of somewhat more than three months he was recalled, when Lord Shelburne eame into power. On the death of the marquis of Roękingham he was recommended by the privy eouneil to the king as his successor at the Treasury; but Lord Shelburne was preferred. When the coalition eame into power, however, he obtained the situation of prime minister, and went out of office with them. During Mr Pitt’s difficulties, when he first eame into administration, in eonsequenee of the house of eommons being against him, an attempt was made to form a eoalition between him and the duke of Portland; but his graee objeeted to the conditions on whieh Mr Pitt eame into power, and refused his support unless he would resign his plaee and come in again on equal terms with himself and his friends.

In 1792 he was elected chancellor of the university of Oxford; and soon afterwards he, as well as several other friends of Mr Fox, who differed from that statesman respecting the Freneh revolution, left the opposition and joined the ministry. Upon this he was appointed lord-lieutenant of the eounty of Nottingham, and, in 1794, secretary of state for the home department. The scareity and high priee of provisions, and the state-trials, which oeeurred soon after he beeame seeretary of state, rendered his office arduous and unpleasant. He discharged his duty, however, under these eircumştanees, with moderation, and with acknowledged good intentions, though not always perhaps with vigour and judgment. He continued seeretary of state till Mr Addington beeame prime minister in 1801, when he exchanged this situation for the more easy duty of president of the couneil. On the death of Mr Pitt, and the appointment of Lord Grenville and Mr Fox to the ministry, in the spring of 1806, he was removed from the presidentship of the eouneil; but he was again ealled into publie life, and plaeed at the head of the treasury, in March 1807, when Lord Grenville’s administration elosed. His Graee, however, though nominally the prime minister, was too infirm to take an aetive part in the high and arduous duties of this situation, which were discharged almost entirely by Mr Pereeval, the ehaneellor őf the exchequer. He eontinued nominally the first lord of the treasury till a very short time before his death, whieh happened on the 30th of Oetober 1809.

The abilities of his grace were certainly but moderate, and very far inferior to those whieh he must have possessed had he been, as latterly there has been an attempt to prove, the author of Junius's Letters; but his understanding was good, and he was by no means unwilling or unable to give regular attention to official business. His political integrity was never questioned, even by the party he abandoned.
