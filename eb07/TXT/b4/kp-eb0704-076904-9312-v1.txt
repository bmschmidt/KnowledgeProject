BONN, a circle in the Prussian government of Cologne, extending over 75 square miles, or 48,000 acres, including, besides the city, three villages on the left bank of the Rhine, with 24,118 inhabitants. It was the estate of the archbishop of Cologne before the sequestration which accompanied the French revolution. The city, which gives name to the circle, is close to the Rhine, in a most beautiful country. Some of the public buildings, especially the palace and the cathedral, are in very good taste. There is a fine market-place and tolerable good streets. It contains 1109 houses and 19,565 inhabitants. It has gained much celebrity since its transfer to Prussia, by the liberal establishment of a university, to the use of which the archi√©piscopal palace has been appropriated. A library, apparatus, and botanical garden have been founded, and endowments fixed for professors, among which are to be found some of the most celebrated names in Germany. Long. 9. 38. 40. E. Lat. 50. 24. N.
