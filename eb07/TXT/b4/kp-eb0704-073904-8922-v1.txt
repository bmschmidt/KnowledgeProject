BOLABOLA, or Borabora, one of the Society Islands, in the South Pacific Ocean. It is about twenty-four miles in circumference, and is surrounded by a reef of rocks and islets. A very lofty double-peaked mountain rises in the centre. There is a border of low land along the coast, which is very fertile, and covered with cocoa-nut and bread-fruit trees. The island is populous, and the inhabitants are of a more warlike disposition than their neighbours, some of whom they have subdued. Long. 151. 52. W. Lat. 16. 32. N.
