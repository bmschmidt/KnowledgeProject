BEZOAR. This name, which is derived from a Persian word implying an antidote to poison, was given to a con? cretion found in the stomach of an animal of the goat kind, and once very highly valued for this imaginary quality; and hence it has been extended to all concretions found in the intestines of animals. Of these there are several kinds; first, superphosphate of lime, which forms concretions in the intestines of many mammalia; secondly, phosphate of ammonia and magnesia, a concretion of a gray or brown colour, composed of radiations from a centre, and found in the intestines of herbivorous animals, such as the elephant, the horse, &c.; thirdly, biliary concretions, of a reddish brown colour, and frequently met with in the intestines and gall bladders of oxen. This kind is composed of inspissated bile, and is used by painters as an orangeyellow pigment. Besides the above, they also occur hairy, resinous, and ligniform.
