BLINDING, a species of corporal punishment anciently inflicted on thieves, adulterers, perjurers, and others, and from which the ancient Christians were not exempt. Sometimes a mixture of lime and vinegar, or merely scalding vinegar, was poured into the eyes till their balls were consumed; sometimes a rope was twisted round the head till the eyes started out. In the middle ages, the punishment of destroying or putting out the eyes was exchanged for that of irretrievably injuring or impairing the sight; which was effected by holding a red-hot iron dish or bason before the eyes till their humours were dried up and their coats shrivelled.
