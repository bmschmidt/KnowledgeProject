BENHINNOM, in Ancient Geography, a valley in the suburbs and to the east of Jerusalem, forming part of that of Kidron, infamous for the sacrifice of children, or passing them through the fire. The place in the valley where the idol stood to which the sacrifice was made was called Tορhet, frθ m the beating of drurns or tabours in order to drown the shrieks of the children; and it had also the name Geeηοη, or the Valley of Ennom, whence some derive Gehenna, the place of future punishment.
