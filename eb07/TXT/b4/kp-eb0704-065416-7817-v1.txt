ßlZERTA, or Beüzekt, a sea-port in the kingαom of Tunis, on a gulf of the same name, which communicates with a lake in the interior. It occupies the site of the ancient Hippo, whose harbour, by means of a spacious pier protecting it from the north-east wind, was rendered one of the safest and finest on this coast. This important work, however, has been entirely neglected by the Turks, whence the port has been choked up, and now receives only small vessels. The place, however, is still about a mile in circuit, defended by several strong castles and batteries. The principal employment of the inhabitants consists in taking fish, which are found in great abundance in. the adjoining lake, particularly mullets, whose roes, dried and formed ιto the substance called botargo, form a considerable article of Mediterranean commerce. It is situated 30 miles ιorth of Tunis. Long. 9. 48. E. Lat∙ 37. 10. N.
