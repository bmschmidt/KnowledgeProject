BONONIA, in Ancient Geography, a town of Gallia Belgica, supposed to be the Portus Iccius of Caesar, and [7:4:773] the Gessoriacum of Mela, and to have had three different names. In Peutinger’s map it is called Gessoriαcum Bononia. This Bononia corresponds to the modern Bouloqne. Long. 1. 30. E. Lat. 50. 40. N.

Bononia, a town of Italy, in Gallia Cispadana, and probably so called by the Gauls, as there was a Bononia in Gallia Belgica. Its ancient name, when in the hands of the Tuscans, whom the Gauls expelled, was Falsina. In the 563d year of the city the Romans led thither a colony, which, about the beginning of the Actian war, was increased by Augustus. It is the Colonia Bononiensis of Tacitus, and now Bologna. Bononia was also the name of a town in Pannonia Inferior, between Meursa to the north-west and Taurinum to the cast; and there was another Bononia in Moesia Superior, on the Danube, now Bodon in Bulgaria.
