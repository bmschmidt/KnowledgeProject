BACKER, or Bakker, Jacob, portrait and historical painter, was born at Harlingen in 1609, but spent the greater part of his life at Amsterdam. He is mentioned as a skilful painter, particularly of portraits, which he executed with boldness, spirit, and grace. He was remarkable for an uncommon readiness of hand and freedom of pencil; while his incredible expedition in his manner of painting appeared even in a half-length portrait of a lady from Haerlem, which w as begun and finished in one day, although he adorned the figure with rich drapery and several ornamental jewels. He also painted historical subjects with considerable success; and in that style there is a picture by him of Cimon and Iphigenia, which is accounted an excellent performance. He died in 1651.
