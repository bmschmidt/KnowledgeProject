BLADUM, in writers of the middle ages, is a name applied to all sorts of standing corn in the blade and ear. The word is also written blatunι, l)lava, and blavium. In old charters the word bladum included the whole product of the ground, as fruit, corn, flax, grass; and it was sometimes also applied to all sorts of grain or corn threshed on the floor. But the word was more particularly appropriated to bread-corn, or wheat, called in French ble. Thus the knights templars are said to have granted to Sir Wido de Meriton’s wife duas summas bladi.
