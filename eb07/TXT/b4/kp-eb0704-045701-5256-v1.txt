BAUMEN, or Bauman, a cave of Lower Saxony, in Germany, about a mile from Wernigerode, and eighteen miles from Goslar. The entrance is through a rock, and so narrow, that not above one person can pass at a time. There are several paths in it, which the peasants have turned up in searching for the bones of animals, which they sell for unicornsâ€™ horns. Some think this cave reaches as far as Goslar; but be this as it may, there have been found in it the skeletons of men, who are supposed to have been lost in the turnings and windings.
