BISCHOP, or Biskop, John de, an artist, born at the Hague in 1646. He is spoken of with commendation as a painter, and his drawings from the great masters are held in estimation by the curious. In these he had succeeded so happily as to preserve with the greatest exactness the style of the painter whose pictures he copied. But he is most generally known as an engraver; and his works in this line are numerous. They are chiefly etchings, harmonized with the graver; and though slight, yet free, spirited, and pleasing. He worked chiefly at Amsterdam, where he died in 1686, at the age of forty.
