BOARD, a long piece of timber sawed thin for building and several other purposes.

Board is also used for a kind of table or bench, on which several artificers perform their work. In this sense we say a work-hoard, shop-δoαr<7, tailors-δoar<∕, and the like.

Board is likewise used for a flat machine or frame used in certain games, and the like. In this sense we say a draught-δoαr<7, a chess-5oαrd, a shovel-òoard, and the like.

Board, Bureau, is also used for an office where accounts are taken, payments ordered, or some particular business transacted. In this sense we say the hoard of works, hoard of ordnance, hoard of treasury, and the like.
