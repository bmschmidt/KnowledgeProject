BLOSSOM, in a general sense, denotes the flower of any plant.

Blossom, in a more proper sense, is restricted to the flowers of trees which they put forth in the spring, as the forerunners of their fruit, and otherwise called their bloom. The office of the blossom is partly to protect, and partly to draw nourishment to, the embryo fruit or seed.

Blossom, or Peach-Coloured, in the manege, a term applied to a horse that has his hair white, but intermixed all over with sorrel and bay hairs. Such horses are so insensible and hard, both in the mouth and the flanks, that they are little valued; and, besides, they are apt to turn blind.
