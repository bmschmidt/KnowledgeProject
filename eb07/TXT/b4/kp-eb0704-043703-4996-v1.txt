BASTION, in the modern fortification, a huge mass of eaιth, usually faced with sods, sometimes with brick, and r rjy w ith stone, standing out from a rampart of whieh it ls ap∏ncipal part. This is what, in the ancient fortification, was called a bulwark. Solid bastions are those whieh have e void space within them filled up entirely, and raised 0 an equal height with the rampart. Hollow bastions are those surrounded only with a rampart and parapet, vι ∏g the spaee within unoeeupied, where the ground is Ş° ow that no retrenchment ean be made in the eentre, m e event of the rampart being taken. Flat bastion is astιon built i∏ the middle of the eurtain, when it is too n g to be defended by the bastion at its extremes. Cut i∏<r l ° η ì S w hi e h> instead of a point, has a re-entering a . n ^ e ' Composed bastion is when two sides of the a] s θ ri ° r P 0 b r g° n are very unequal, which makes the gorges s unequal. Deformed bastion is when the irregularity of the lines and angles puts the bastion out of shape; as when it wants a demigorge, one side of the interior polygon being too short, Demi-bastion is composed of one faee only, with but one flank, and a demigorge. Double bastion is that which is raised on the plane of another bastion. Regular bastion is that whieh has its true proportion of faces, flanks, and gorges. See Fortification.
