BISOMUM, or Disomum, in Roman Antiquity, a tomb for two dead bodies, or the ashes of two. The ancients frequently buried two, three, or four bodies in the same sepulchre, disposed side by side; and hence the sepulchres of the primitive Christians had the words bisonÎ¹i, trisomi, quadrisomi, &c. inscribed on them, to indicate the number of bodies deposited in them.
