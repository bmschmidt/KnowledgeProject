BARRACAN, in Commerce, a sort of stuff, not diapered, something like camlet, but of a coarser grain. It Î¹s used to make cloaks, surtouts, and such other garments. The cities where barracans are chiefly made in France are Valenciennes, Lisle, Abbeville, Amiens, and Rouen; but those of Valenciennes are the most valued.
