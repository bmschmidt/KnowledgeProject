BESZPRIM, a circle in the Austrian kingdom of Hungary, near the great lake of Platten, the south-east part of which is included within it. It comprehends 1517 square miles, or 970,880 acres, and contains one city, nine towns, and 253 villages, and about 151,868 inhabitants, chiefly of Sclavonian origin. The Catholics are six ninths, the reformed two ninths, and the Lutherans one ninth of the people. The soil is rich, and yields good corn, wine, tobacco, flax, and fruits. More than one third of the land is under wood, which provides fuel, and much of it is also converted into potash. The chief place, a city of the same name, is the seat of the departments of the local administration, and contains about 4850 inhabitants. Long. 17.47. 48. E. Lat. 47. 5. 8. N.
