BAJULUS, an ancient officer in the court of the Greek emperors. There were several degrees of bajuli; as, the grand bajulus, who was preceptor to the emperor; and the simple bajuli, who were sub-preceptors. The word is derived from the Latin verb bajulare, to carry or bear a thing on the arms or on the shoulders; and the origin of the office is thus traced by antiquaries: Children, and especially those of condition, had anciently, besides their nurse, a woman called gerula, as appears from several passages of lertullian; when weaned, or ready to be weaned, they had men to carry them about and take care of them, who were called geruli and bajuli i a gerendo et bajulando. Hence it is that governors of princes and great lords were still denominated bajuli, and their charge or government bajulatio, even after their pupils had grown too big to be carried about. The word passed in the same sense into Greece.
