BEVELLING, in ship-building, the art of hewing a timber with a proper and regular curve, according to a mould which is laid on one side of its surface. In order to hew any piece of timber to its proper bevel, says a writer on ship-building, it will be necessary, first, to make one side fair and out of winding; a term used to signify that the side of a timber should be a plane. If this side be uppermost, and placed horizontally, or upon a level, it is plain, if the timber is to be hewed square, it may be done by a plummet and line; but if the timber is not hewed square, the line will not touch both the upper and lower edge of the piece; or if a square be applied to it, there will be wood wanting either at the upper or lower side. This is called within or without a square. When the wood is deficient at the under side, it is called under-bevelling; and when it is deficient on the upper side, it is called standing-bevelling; and this deficiency will be more or less according to the depth of the piece: so that, before the proper bevellings of the timbers are found, it will be sometimes very convenient to assign the breadth of the timbers; nay, in most cases it will be absolutely necessary, especially afore and abaft; though the breadth of two timbers, or the timber and room, whÎ¹c includes the two timbers and the space between them> may be taken without any sensible error, as far as t e square body goes. For as one line represents the mou ing side of two timbers, the foreside of the one being sup posed to unite with the aft-side of the other, the two nW be considered as one entire piece of timber.
