BAITING, the act of attacking and harassing greater and stronger animals by smaller or weaker ones. In this sense we hear of the baiting of bulls or bears by mastiffs or bull-dogs.

- BAJALUKA, a city, the capital of a sandschak or province of Bosnia, in Turkey in Europe. It stands on the river Berbas, and is strongly fortified with a citadel, being the frontier garrison towards Austria. It contains 2700 houses, forty mosques, and, with the suburbs, which are chiefly occupied by Greeks, 15,000 inhabitants. It is a place of considerable traffic and manufactures. Among the latter, gunpowder is the most productive. Near it are some celebrated warm medicinal springs.
