BIDDOOMAHS, a fierce and piratical tribe who inhabit a cluster of large rugged islands in the eastern part of the great African lake or inland sea called the Tchad. They neither sow, plant, nor rear cattle, but maintain the creed, that providence, while withholding from them these goods, has bestowed strength and courage to wrest them from the nations in whose possession they may be found; and they exert themselves with the utmost activity to fulfil this assumed destination. They own nearly a thousand barks of some magnitude, with which they have made themselves complete masters of this water, and extend their ravages round the whole circuit of its shores. Bornou and others of the more powerful states have ceased to dispute with them the command of its waves. Some of these men, whom Major Denham saw at Bornou, appeared. to him about the wildest and rudest human beings he had ever beheld.
