BLACKALL, Offspring, bishop of Exeter in the beginning of the eighteenth century, was born at London in the year 1654, and educated at Catharine-Hall, Cambridge. For two years he refused to take the oath of allegiance to William and Mary, but at last submitted to the government, though he seemed to condemn the revolution, and all that had been done in pursuance of it. He was a man of great piety, with much primitive simplicity and integrity, and a constant evenness of mind. In a sermon preached by him before the House of Commons 30th January 1699, he animadverted on Toland’s assertion, in his life of Milton, that Charles I. was not the writer of the Icon Bαsilike; and also on some insinuations against the authenticity of the Holy Scriptures; which produced a controversy between him and that author. In 1700 he preached in St Paul’s, at Boyle’s lecture, a course of sermons, which were afterwards published; and he was consecrated bishop of Exeter in 1707. He died at Exeter in 1716, and was interred in the cathedral there.
