BITTER, an epithet given to all bodies of an opposite taste to sweetness.

Bitter, a sea-term, signifying any turn of the cable about the bits, so that it may be let out by little and little. When the ship is stopped by a cable, she is said to be brought up by a bitter; and that end of the cable which is wound about the bits is called the bitter end of the cable.
