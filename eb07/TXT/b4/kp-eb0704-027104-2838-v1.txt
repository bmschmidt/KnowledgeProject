BACCHANALIA, feasts celebrated in honour of Bacchus by the ancients. The two most remarkable were denominated the greater and lesser. The lesser, called Len(ea, from a word signifying a wine-press, were held in the open field about autumn; the greater, called Dionysia, from one of the names of Bacchus, were celebrated in the city about the spring time.
