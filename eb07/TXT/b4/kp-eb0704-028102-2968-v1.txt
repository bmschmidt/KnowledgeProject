BAGLIVI, George, a celebrated physician of Italy, was a native of Apulia, and born about the year 1668. He studied at Padua, where he became doctor; and then went to Rome, where he was chosen professor of anatomy. He died at Rome in 1706, at the early age of thirty-eight. A collection of his pieces, which are all in the Latin language, was published in 4to in 1704, and has been several times reprinted in the same form. An edition in 2 vols. 8vo was published in 1788.
