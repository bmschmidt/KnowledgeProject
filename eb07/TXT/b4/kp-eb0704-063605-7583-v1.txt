BIDENTES, in middle-age writers, denotes two-yearlings, or sheep of the second year. The wool of these bidentes, or two-year-old sheep, being the first shearing, was sometimes claimed as a heriot to the king on the death of an abbot. Among the ancient Romans the word was extended further to any sorts of beasts used for victims, especially those of that age; and hence we meet with sues bidentes.
