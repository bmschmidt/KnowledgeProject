BERCHEM, or Berghem, Nicholas, a painter, was a native of Haerlem, and born in 1624. He received instructions from several very eminent masters; and it was no small addition to their fame that Berchem was then’ scholar. The pictures of cattle and figures by this master are held in high estimation; and he has been singularly happy in having many of them finely engraved by John Visscher, an eminent artist in his own line. The distinguishing characters of the pictures of Berchem are, the breadth and just distribution of the lights, the grandeur of his masses of shadow, natural ease and simplicity in the attitudes of his figures, the just gradation of his distances, the brilliancy and transparency of his colouring, the cor-redness[7:4:581] and true perspective of his design, and the elegance of his composition.

0 BERCHETT, Peter, an eminent historical painter, was born in France in 1659, and at the age of eighteen was employed in the royal palaces. He came to England in 1681, to work under Rambour, a French painter of architecture; but after staying a year, he returned to Marli. He revisited this country, however, and was sent by King William to the palace then building at Loo, where he was employed fifteen months; after which he came a third time to England, where he had sufficient business, and painted the ceiling of the chapel of Trinity College, Oxford, the staircase at the Duke of Schomberg’s in Pall-mall, and the summer-house at Ranclagh. Towards the close of his life he retired to Marybone, where he painted only small pieces of fabulous history, and died there in January 1720.
