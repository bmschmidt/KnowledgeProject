BALTIMORE, a decayed town of Ireland, in the county of Cork, situated on a headland projecting into the sea, with a good harbour. It is 13 miles south-east of Bantry.

Baltimore, a town of Maryland, in North America. It is situated round the head of a small bay, which is an arm of the Chesapeak, and near the mouth of the river Patapsco. The basin which forms the harbour is of a circular form, with a narrow entrance guarded by a fort, and is large enough to contain 2000 merchant vessels. Baltimore is now the third port, in point of trade, in the United States, New York and Philadelphia only being superior. Its progress has been rapid beyond example. In 1750 it was a village of ten or twelve houses, and in 1818 it contained 60,000 inhabitants. The merchants here are considered among the most enterprising in the United States. The tonnage belonging to the port in 1815 amounted to 107,137 tons. A British force attacked Baltimore in September 1814; but the ships of war being unable to force the entrance to the harbour, the attack by land proved unsuccessful, and the troops withdrew, with the loss of the commander, General Ross, and 200 men. The houses in Baltimore are generally well built, and many of the public edifices are extremely handsome. The Roman Catholics are the most numerous class; the other considerable sects are the Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Baptists, and Quakers. The democratic party have a more decided superiority in Baltimore than in any other great city in the United States. Long. 76. 40. W. Lat. 39. 10. N.
