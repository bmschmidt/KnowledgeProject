BERRIMAN, Dr William, was the son of Mr John Berπman, apothecary in Bishopsgate Street, London, where he was born in 1688. He studied at Oriel College, Oxford, where he took his several degrees, and became curate and lecturer of All-Hallows in Thames Street, and lecturer of St Michael’s Queenhithe. In 1720 he was appointed domestic chaplain to Dr Robinson, bishop of London, who soon after collated him to the living of St Andrew’s Undershaft; in 1727 he was elected fellow of Eton College; and he died in 1750 in the sixty-second year of his age.
