BLONDEL, David, a Protestant minister, distinguished by his skill in ecclesiastical and civil history, was born at Chalons-sur-Marne, and was admitted minister at a synod of the Isle of France in 1614. He wrote, 1. A Defence of the Reformed Churches of France; 2. A work against the Decretal Epistles; 3. De Episcopis et Presbyteris; and other pieces. Bayle informs us that he had a very singular way of studying. He lay on the ground, and had around him the books which he wanted for the work he was composing. He died in 1665, aged sixty-four.

Blondel, Francis, regius professor of mathematics and architecture, was employed in several négociations; arrived at the dignity of maréchal-de-camp and counsellor of state; and had the honour of being chosen to teach the dauphin of France mathematics. He was also made member of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, and director of the Academy of Architecture. He died at Paris in 1688, aged sixty-eight. His principal productions were, 1. Notes on the Architecture oťSavot; 2. A Course of Architecture and Mathematics; 3. The Art of Throwing Bombs; 4. A new Manner of Fortifying Places; 5. A Comparison between Pindar and Horace; and other works.
