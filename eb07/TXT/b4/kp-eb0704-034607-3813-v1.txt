BAÃ‘IER, Anthony, member of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-lettres, an ecclesiastic of the diocese of Clermont in Auvergne, was born in 1673. He is principally celebrated for his translation of the Metamorphoses of Ovid, with historical remarks and explanations; which was published in 1732, at Amsterdam, in folio, finely ornamented with copperplates by Picart, and reprinted at Paris in 1738, in two vols. 4to; and for his Mythology or Fables of the Ancients, explained by History; a work full of information, which was translated into English, and printed at London in 1741, in four vols. 8vo. He died at Paris in November 1741.
