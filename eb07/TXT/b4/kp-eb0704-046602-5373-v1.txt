BAYLA, or Bela, a town of Persia, in the province of Mckran, and capital of the district of Lus. It is built on the north-eastern bank of the river Pooralee. About one third of the town in the western quarter is encompassed by a tolerably good mud wall; the remainder is totally unprotected against any attack cither of horse or foot. The streets are narrow; but from the elevated situation of the town, and its rocky site, they must be always dry, even in the wettest weather. The bazar is very neat and clean. Bayla is the residence of the chief of Lus, whose government is mild and equitable, and insures complete protection to mercantile dealers. His durbar or hall of audience is a large open apartment of very ordinary structure, and he maintains no state nor order. The town contains 1500 houses and 6000 inhabitants. It is 293 miles N. of Kelat. Long. 66. 40. E. Lat. 26. 10. N.
