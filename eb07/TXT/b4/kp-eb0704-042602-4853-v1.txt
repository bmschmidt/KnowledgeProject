BASILEUS, βα<nλsυς, a title assumed by the emperors of Constantinople, exclusive of all other princes, to whom they gave the title rex, or king. The title basileus was subsequently assumed by other kings, particularly the kings of England; as Ego Edgar totius Anglioe basileus confirmavi. Hence also the queen of England was anciently styled Basilea or Basilissa.
