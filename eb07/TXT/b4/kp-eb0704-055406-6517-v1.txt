BELLONA, in Pagan Mythology, the goddess of war, is generally reckoned the sister of Mars, but some represent her as both his sister and wife. This goddess is described as of a cruel and savage disposition, delighting in bloodshed and slaughter; as not only the attendant of Mars, but as taking a pleasure in sharing his dangers. Hence she is commonly represented in an attitude expres. sive of fury and distraction, with her hair composed of snakes clotted with gore, and her garments stained with blood; sometimes she is depictured driving the chariot of Mars, with a bloody whip in her hand, sometimes with a lighted torch or brand, and a trumpet. Bellona had a temple at Rome, near the Circus Flaminius.
