BEYRA or Beira, a province of the kingdom of Portugal, bounded on the north by Tras os Montes, on the east by the Spanish province of Estremadura, on the south by Alentejo and Portuguese Estremadura, and on the west by the Atlantic Ocean. It extends over 7710 square miles, and contains 1,129,200 inhabitants. It is chiefly a mountainous district, some of its highest points reaching to 7000 or 8000 feet. The Duero is the main river, which receives the waters of the smaller streams in their way to the ocean. Agriculture is in a neglected state, and, before the general introduction of potatoes, required an annual importation of foreign corn. The chief employment is the cultivation of vines, oranges, and chestnuts.
