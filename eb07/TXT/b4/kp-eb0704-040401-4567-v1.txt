BARONI, Leonora, a celebrated singer and composer, was born at Naples, but spent the greater part of her life at Rome. She was daughter of Adriana Baroni of Mantua, baroness of Piancaretta, a lady also distinguished for her musical talents, and, on account of her beauty, surnamed the Fair. Leonora, like her mother, was celebrated by the wits, who vied with one another in their eulogiums of the fair cantatrice; and, in 1639, there was published, at Bracciano, a collection of Latin, Greek, Italian, Spanish, and French poems addressed to her, under the title of Applausi Poetici alle Glorie della Signora Leonora Baroni. Among the Latin poems of Milton are no fewer than three, entitled AdLeonoram Bomae Canentem, in which this lady is celebrated for her vocal powers, with an allusion to her mother’s exquisite performance on the lute. A discourse on the music of the Italians, printed with the life of Malherbe, and some other treatises, at Paris, 1672, in 12mo, contains an elaborate and somewhat high-flown eulogium on the musical talents of this accomplished lady. It was composed by Μ. Maugars, prior of St Peter de Mac, the king’s interpreter of the English language, and so famous as a performer on the viol, that the king of Spain and several other sovereign princes of Europe desired to hear him.

• BARONIUS, Caesar, a pious and learned cardinal, was born at Sore in 1538. He studied at Rome, and put himself under the discipline of Philip de Neri. In 1593 he was made general of the congregation of the Oratory by the resignation of the founder Philip de Neri. Pope Clement VIII. made him his confessor, and raised him to the rank of cardinal in 1596. He was afterwards made librarian to the Vatican, and died in 1605, at the age of sixty-eight. He wrote several works, the principal of which is his Annales Ecclesiastici from A. d. 1 to 1198, in 12 vols, folio; a work which has been abridged by several persons, particularly by Henry Spondaeus, Bzovius, and Ludovico Aurelio.
