BEGUINES, a congregation of female religionists or nuns, founded either by St Begghe or by Lambert le Begue, who died about the end of the twelfth century. They were originally established at Li√®ge, and afterwards at Seville; and from this last settlement sprang the great number of Beguines, which spread over all Flanders, and thence passed into Germany, where some of these religionists fell into extravagant errors; persuading themselves that it was possible, in the present life, to arrive at the highest perfection, even at impeccability and a clear view of God. The council of Vienna condemned these errors, and abolished the order of Beguines, permitting such of them, however, as continued in the true faith to ve in chastity, either with or without vows; under cover of which permission the decree of the council was evaded, and communities of Beguines spread throughout all Flanders.
