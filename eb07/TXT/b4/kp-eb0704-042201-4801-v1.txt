BARTHIUS, Gaspard, a learned and copious writer, born at Custrin, in Brandenburg, the 22d of June 1587. Μ. Baillet has inserted the name of Barthius among his Enfans Célèbres, upon the ground that at twelve years of age he had translated David’s Psalms into Latin verse of every measure, and published several Latin poems.. Upon the death of his father, who was professor of the civil law at Frankfort, counsellor to the elector of Brandenburg, and chancellor at Custrin, he was sent to Gotha, then to Eisenach, and afterwards, according to custom, went through all the different universities in Germany. When he had finished his studies, he travelled into Italy, France, Spain, and England. He studied the modern as well as ancient languages, and his translations from the Spanish and French show that he was not content with a superficial knowledge. Upon his return to Germany he fixed his residence at Leipsic, where he led a retired life, his passion for study having made him renounce all sort of employment. He wrote a great number of books, the principal of which are, 1. His Adversaria, a large volume in folio, the second and third volumes being left by him in manuscript; 2. A Translation of Aeneas Gazaeus; 3. A large volume of Notes upon Claudian, in 4to; 4. Three large volumes upon Statius. He died at Leipsic in 1658.
