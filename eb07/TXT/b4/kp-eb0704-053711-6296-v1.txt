BEESTINGS, or Breastings, a term used by country people for the first milk taken from a cow after calving. The beestings are of a thick consistence and yellow colour, seemingly impregnated with sulphur. D Morgan imagines them peculiarly fitted and intended by nature to cleanse the young animal from the recrements gathered in its stomach and intestines during its long habitation in utero. He supposes women’s first milk after delivery to possess a similar virtue; and hence he infers the necessity of the mother’s suckling her own child, rather than committing it to a nurse whose first milk is gone.
