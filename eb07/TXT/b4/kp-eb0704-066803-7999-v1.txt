BLAGRAVE, John, the second son of John Blagrave of Bulmarsh-court, near Sunning in Berkshire, was descended of an ancient family in that county. From a grammar-school at Reading he was sent to St Johnâ€™s College, Oxford, where he applied himself chiefly to the study of mathematics; and without taking any degree, afterwards retired to his patrimonial seat of Southcolelodge, near Reading, where he spent the remainder of his life. In this mansion he died in the year 1611, and was buried in the church of St Lawrence, where a monument was erected to his memory. He is said to have been not more remarkable for his mathematical knowledge than for his candour and generosity to his acquaintance. His works are, 1. A Mathematical Jewel, Lond. 1585, folio; 2. Of the Making and Use of the Familiar Staff, Lond. 1590, 4to; 3. Astrolabium Uranicum Generale, Lond. 1596, 4to; 4. The Art of Dialling, Lond. 1609, 4to.
