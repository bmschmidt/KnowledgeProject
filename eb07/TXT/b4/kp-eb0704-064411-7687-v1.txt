BIOTHANATI, from 'β∣α, violence, and Qαjατος, death, in some medical writers, denotes those who die a violent death. The word is also written, and with more propriety, biathanati. In a more particular sense, it denotes those who kill themselves, and are properly called αutothα-ηati. In this sense it is that the word is used both by Greek and Latin writers.

Biothanati, supposed by some to be derived from βιος, life, and 0aΛ∕aτοζ, death, was also a name of reproach given by the Heathens to the primitive Christians, on account of their constancy and forwardness to lay down their lives in martyrdom.
