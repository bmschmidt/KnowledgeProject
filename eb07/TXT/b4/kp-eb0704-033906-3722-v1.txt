BANAT, one of the divisions of Hungary, which is included in the military frontier provinces. It extends over 2973 square miles, or 1,802,720 acres, and contains one market-town, two cities, and 162 villages, with 174,650 inhabitants. The latter are mostly of the Greek church,â€™ but about one third are Catholics, with a few Lutherans. It borders on Wallachia, and on the Turkish territory. Part of the Banat consists of a level plain, but much is mountainous, especially towards Wallachia, where it comprehends a portion of the Carpathians within its boundary. It is very productive in corn, cattle, flax, and hemp; but the cultivators want markets and access to places of consumption. There are none but domestic manufactures. The chief city is Pancsova, at the junction of the Themes with the Danube.
