BADAKSHAN, or Buducsπan, a mountainous district, situated to the north of the great Himalaya ridge, which bounds Hindostan on the north. It is about twenty days journey east-south-east of Buckharia, and nearly south of Kokaun. It comprehends the higher valley of the Amoo, which is here called the Jihonor the Jaxartes, togetherwith all the other valleys of its tributary streams, and all the mountains connected with them as far nearly as the sources of that river. The district of Badakshan rises gradually to its level from the lower and northern part of the province of Balkh, which occupies the left bank farther down the river. This country is described as mountainous and well wooded, and the people uncivilized, and even savage in their manners. They live in villages surrounded with gardens, and situated in the little glens and recesses of the hills. The mountainous districts of this province are famed for some of the richest mines of lapis lazuli and of rubies that are known. The former is found in veins, sometimes of considerable thickness, in a gray matrix; and masses of v this stone are occasionally procured capable of being wrought into large slabs. They are carried to Buckharia for sale, and thence to Russia. The rubies are found imbedded in a white earth, in large masses of crystal. Some large and coarse crystals are also found, as well as emeralds, according to the information of Fraser. The chief town is Fyzabad, which is said not to be more than 150 miles from Balkh. There is another town of the same name as the province, and of considerable importance. Mr Fraser could gain little authentic information concerning the people of this remote country, their habits, or the nature of their government. They arc, however, rigid and intolerant Mahommedans, among whom it would be dangerous for any European to reside. (Fraser’s Journey into Khorassαη. Elphinstone.)
