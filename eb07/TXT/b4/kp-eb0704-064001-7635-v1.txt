BILGE of a ship, the bottom of her floor, or the breadth of the place the ship rests on when she is a-ground. Therefore bilge-water is that which lies on her floor and cannot go to the well of the pump; and bilgepumps, or burr-pumps, are those that carry off the bilge-water. They likewise say the ship is bilged when she has some of her timber struck off on a rock or anchor, and springs a leak.
