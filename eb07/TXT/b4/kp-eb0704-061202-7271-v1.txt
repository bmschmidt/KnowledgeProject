BIAS, one of the seven sages of Greece, who flourished about 608 before Christ. He was accustomed to say, that it was a sickness of the mind to wish for impossible things. During the siege of Priene, his native city, being asked why he alone had retired from the place without carrying any thing with him, he replied, that he carried his all with him; meaning, that knowledge and virtue were the only blessings peculiarly his own, since they could not be taken from him. He expired ,while in the act of pleading for one of his friends.

Bias, in a general sense, the inclination or bent of a personâ€™s mind to one thing more than another. It also signifies the lead or weight put into a bowl, that draws or turns the course of it any way to which the bias inclines.
