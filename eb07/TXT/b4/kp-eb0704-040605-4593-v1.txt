BARRAY, one of the Hebrides, about eight miles in length, of unequal breadth, and of an irregular figure. It produces oats, barley, and potatoes; and it contains about 20,000 superficial acres of wood. The fishery is prosecuted here with great activity, and about 30,000 ling and cod are annually caught and exported. A kind of shark is also taken, from which the fishermen obtain oil for sale or consumption. The rearing of cattle and the burning of kelp afford the chief employment to the inhabitants, who are mostly Roman Catholics. The population amounts to 1969.
