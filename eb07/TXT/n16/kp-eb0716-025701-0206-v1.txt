NORTON, in Cheshire, a good modern alms-house, erected on the site of a priory of canons regular of St Augustin, founded in the year 1135, by William, son of Nigellus. But the latter did not live to complete his design; for Eustace de Burgaville granted to Hugh de Catharine pasture for a hundred sheep, on condition that he finished the church in all respects conformably to the intentions of the founders.
