NONJURORS, those who refused to take the oaths to government, and who were in consequence under certain incapacities, and liable to certain severe penalties. It can scarcely be said that there are now any nonjurors in the kingdom; and it is well known that all penalties have been removed both from Papists and Protestants, formerly of that denomination, as well in Scotland as in England. The members of the Episcopal church of Scotland were long denominated nonjurors; but they are now improperly called so, because the ground of their difference from the establishment is more on account of ecclesiastical than of political principles.
