NOVATUS, a priest of Carthage in the third century, who, to avoid being punished for a crime, joined with the deacon named Felicissimus against St Cyprian. In 251 he went to Rome, and there found Novatian, who had acquired great reputationâ€™ by his eloquence, but who murmured at his not being raised to the see of Rome in preference to Cornelius. Novatus soon contracted a friendship with him, and afterwards promoted the consecration of Novatian. This irregular proceeding produced a very great schism. Novatus also maintained that the church had not the power to receive those into communion who had fallen into idolatry.
