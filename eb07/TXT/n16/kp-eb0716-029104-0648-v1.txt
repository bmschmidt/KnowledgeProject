NOVICE, a person not yet skilled or experienced in an art or profession. In the ancient Roman militia, novicii or noÏ…itii were the young raw soldiers, distinguished by this appellation from the veterans. In the ancient orders of knighthood, there were novices or clerks in arms, who went through a kind of apprenticeship ere they were admitted knights.

Novice is more particularly used in monasteries for a religious person still in his or her year of probation, and who has not made the vows. In some convents the subprior has the direction of the novices. In nunneries the novices wear a white veil, the rest a black one.
