NOBAH, a city beyond Jordan, which took the name of Nobah from an Israelite of this name who had conquered it. Gideon pursued the Midianites as far as this city. Eusebius informs us, that there is a desolate place of this name about eight miles from HeshboÏ€, towards the south; but this could not be the Nobah now mentioned, because the latter was much farther to the north.
