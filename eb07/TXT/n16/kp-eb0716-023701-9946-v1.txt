NOD, or the Land of Nod. It was to this country that Cain withdrew after the murder of his brother. The Septuagint, as well as Josephus, read Naid instead of Nod, and have taken it for the name of a place. It is not easy to ascertain what country this was, unless perhaps it was the country of Nyse or Nysea, towards Hyrcania. St Jerome and the Chaldaic interpreters have taken the word Nod in the sense of an appellative for vagabond or fugitive; “He dwelt a fugitive in the land.”
