NOMARCHA, in Antiquity, the governor or commander of a nome or department. Egypt was anciently divided into several regions or departments, called names, from the Greek νομος, taken in the sense of a division; and the officer who had the administration of each nome from the king, was called nomaτcha, from νομος, and αξχη, command.
