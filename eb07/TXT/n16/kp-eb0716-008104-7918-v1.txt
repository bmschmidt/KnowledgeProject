NEJIN, a city of Russia, in the province of Tchernigow, in what was formerly distinguished as Little Russia. It stands on the river Oster. The streets are intermixed with large gardens, filled with fruit trees of various kinds. It contains 1000 houses, two convents, and sixteen churches, all built after the model of those in Moscow, and is reckoned the handsomest town to the south of that capital. The inhabitants are about 12,000, composed, besides Russians and Kossacks, of many Greek and Armenian families. The most distinguished building is the Gymnasium Bezborodko, founded by the count of that name. It is a large edifice, adorned by a colonnade of twelve Ionic pillars, and, being surrounded by high trees, it has a truly noble appearance. It was instituted for the education of young noblemen.
