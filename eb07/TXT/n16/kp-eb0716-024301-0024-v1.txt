NORDBOTTENS and Wasterbotten t s, two provinces of the most northern part of Sweden, now formed into one, extending in north latitude from 63. 28. to 69. 20., and in east longitude from 15. 1. to 24. 2., and having an extent of 66,396 square miles. It is a mountainous country, interspersed with lakes. The winter lasts nine months, during which the surface is covered with snow; but in a few sheltered spots a little rye and barley, and some flax and hemp, may be cultivated. In the most northern part lew trees grow, butin the south there are some birches and firs. The cows yield some butter; but the chief animals are the rein-deer, which form a great article of food. The whole population is estimated at 75,000. There are no places in the province that can be considered as towns, though Tornea and Pithea are called so.
