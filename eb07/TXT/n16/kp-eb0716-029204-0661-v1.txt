NUAYHAS, or Ague Tree, a name given by the Indians to a sort of bamboo cane, the leaves of which falling into the water, arc said to impregnate it with such virtue that the bathing in it afterwards cures the ague. To dissolve coagulated blood, they use also a decoction of the leaves, giving it internally, and at the same time rubbing with it the bruised part externally. It is said that this plant bears its flowers only once in its life; that it lives sixty years before the flowers make their appearance; and that, when they begin to show themselves, it withers away in abouta month afterwards, that is, as soon as it has ripened the seed. There appears to be something of fiction in the account given of this tree in the Hortus Malabaricus ; but it seems certain, that the length of the stalk, or trunk, must be very great. In the gallery of Leyden there is preserved a cane of nuayhas twenty-eight feet long; and another not much shorter, and more than eight inches in diameter, may be seen in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.
