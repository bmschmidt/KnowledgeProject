NONES, nonae, in the Roman calendar, the fifth day of the months of January, February, April, June, August, September, November, and December; and the seventh of March, May, July, and October. March, May, July, and October, had six days in their nones; because these alone, in the ancient constitution of the year by Numa, had thirty-one days each, the rest having only twenty-nine, and February thirty; but when Caesar reformed the year, and made other months contain thirty-one days, he did not allot them six days of nones.
