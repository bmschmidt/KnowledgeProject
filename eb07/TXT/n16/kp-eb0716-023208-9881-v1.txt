NISHEGOROD, a province of the Russian empire, in Europe. It takes its name from the capital eity, and extends in north latitude from 54. 31. to 56. 4., and in east longitude from 41. 37. to 46. 27., containing 21,142 square miles. It is divided into eleven circles, whieh comprehend thirteen cities and 5380 villages, which latter are formed into 762 parishes, eaeh having a Greek ehureh. The inhabitants are estimated at 1,59θ>000, the great mass of whom adhere to the religion of the Greek church; but there are many tribes of Tartars scattered throughout the province, who, like their ancestors, remain heathens. The whole province is undulating, with no elevations that are more than 400 feet above the level of the sea. The soil is generally sandy, but much of it is compounded of portions of clay and marl, and other earths, so that where cultivation is conducted with any degree of skill and attention, the produce is considerable. In corn the crops eommonly yield one fourth more than the consumption requires. The chief grains are rye and buck-wheat; but there is much wheat grown, and the increase on appropriate soils is said to be tenfold the seed. A great quantity both of hemp and flax is raised, and all the common garden vegetables and fruits. The woods extend along the banks of the great rivers, and afford abundance of fuel, and of timber for the construction of houses and ships. The province is admirably watered, the chief river being the W olga, which receives the waters of the Oka, the Kutma, the Kirsentz, the Sura, the Wetluga, and the Alatyr, all of which are navigable to the main stream. It is a manufacturing district, producing abundance of matting, hempen and flaxen eloths, soap and candles, iron in bars and in common implements, leather, eorn, spirits, and some glass. These, with live cattle, raw hides, and wood, form the principal articles of the export trade, whieh is ehiefly carried on by the Wolga and its tributary streams. The eity of Nishegorod, the capital, is 830 miles from St Petersburg, being in latitude 56.19. 43. north, and in longitude 46. 23. 5. east. It stands at the·

junction of the Oka with the Wolga, in a picturesque situation, between hills; and it is the centre of the trade, as well as of the government of its province, and the seat of a Greek bishop. It contains 1826 houses, mostly of wood, and 12,300 inhabitants, who chiefly subsist by manufactures and trade, which connect them with the Persians, Siberians, Turks, and Tartars, who resort in great crowds, especially to a fair which lasts from the 29th of June to the end of July annually.
