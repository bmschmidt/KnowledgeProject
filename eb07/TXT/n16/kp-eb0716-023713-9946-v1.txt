NOIRMOUTIER, an island belonging to the department of La Vendée, and arrondissement of Les Sables d’Olonne, in France. It forms a canton, and is on the western side of the island of Bouin. It is about fifteen miles in length, and about four in breadth. Its situation is low, and, to prevent the sea from overflowing it, it is surrounded with powerful dikes. The soil is very rich within the enclosure, and produces heavy crops of corn. Beyond the dikes are marshes, which afford abundance of salt formed by natural evaporation. The inhabitants are 5700, and many of them expert seamen, occupied in the fisheries. The chief town gives its name to the island; it contains 1600 inhabitants, and has a harbour capable of admitting vessels of fifty or sixty tons. Long. 2. 21. W. Lat. 47.1. N.
