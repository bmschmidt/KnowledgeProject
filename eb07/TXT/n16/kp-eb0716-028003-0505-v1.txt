NOTO, a city of the island of Sicily, in the kingdom of Naples, the capital of the province of the same name, 149 miles from Palermo. It stands on a rocky hill, in a fine but unhealthy situation. It has elegant streets, with noble churches and convents, and forms one of the most respectable places on the island; whilst the surrounding soil, though much of it is neglected, is of abundant fertility. Its port is Avola, about seven miles distant. It contains 1958 houses, and 13,300 inhabitants.

Noto, Val di, one of the three valleys or provinces into which Sicily is divided, and which lies between the sea, the Vai di Demona, and the Vai di Mazara. Noto is the capital town.
