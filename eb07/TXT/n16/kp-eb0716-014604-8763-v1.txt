NEVA, a river in Russia, flowing through St Petersburg, the capital of that empire. The views upon the banks exhibit the grandest and most lively scenes. The river is in most places broader than the Thames at London. It is deep, rapid, and transparent as crystal, and its banks are lined upon each side with a continued range of handsome buildings. See Petersburg.
