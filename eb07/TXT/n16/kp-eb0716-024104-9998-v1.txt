NONAGESIMAL, or Nonagesimal Degree, called Iso the Mid Heaven, is the highest point, or ninetieth egree of the ecliptic, reckoned from its intersection with he horizon at any time; and its altitude is equal to the ngle which the ecliptic makes with the horizon at their Î¹tersection, or equal to the distance of the zenith from the pole of the ecliptic. It is much used in the calculation of solar eclipses.
