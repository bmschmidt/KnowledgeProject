ELEEMOSYNARIUS, in our old writers, means the almoner or peculiar officer who received the eleemosynary rents and gifts, and distributed them for pious and charitable purposes. There was an officer of this description in all religious houses. Formerly the bishops also had their almoners, as the king has at present.
