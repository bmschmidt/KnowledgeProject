ELTHAM, a market-town of the county of Kent, in the hundred of Blackheath, eight miles from London. The market is held on Monday. It is remarkable for the manor-house called King Johnâ€™s Palace, formerly a royal residence; and for a modern building on Shooter's Hill, erected by Commodore James, to celebrate his capture of a similar fortress called Savendroog, belonging to Angria, a pirate on the coast of Bombay, in India. The population amounted in 1801 to 1627, in 1811 to 1813, in 1821 to 1883, and in 1831 to 2129.
