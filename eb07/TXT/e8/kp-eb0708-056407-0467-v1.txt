ELECT or Chosen (from eligo, I choose), in the Scriptures, is applied to the primitive Christians; in which sense the elect are those chosen and admitted to the favour and blessing of Christianity.

Elect, in some systems of theology, is a term appropriated to the saints, or the predestinated; in which sense the elect are those persons who are said to be predestinated to glory as the end, and to sanctification as the means.

Elect is likewise applied to archbishops, bishops, and other officers, who are chosen, but not consecrated, or actually invested with their office or jurisdiction.

The emperor is said to be elect before he is inaugurated and crowned; and a lord mayor is elect before his predecessor's mayoralty is expired, or the sword is put in his hands.
