EMULATION, a generous ardour kindled by the praiseworthy example of others, which impels us to imitate, to rival, and, if possible, to excel them. This passion involves in it esteem of the person whose attainments or conduct we emulate, and of the qualities or actions in which we emulate him, and a desire of resemblance, together with a joy springing from the hope of success. The word conies originally from the Greek άμιλλα, a dispute or contest; whence the Latin oemulus, and thence our emulation.
