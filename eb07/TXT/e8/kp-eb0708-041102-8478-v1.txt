EDEN, the name of a country, with a garden, in which the progenitors of mankind were settled by God himself. The term denotes pleasure or delight. It would be endless to recount the several opinions which have been entertained concerning its situation, some of them very wild and extravagant. The garden was also called Paradise; a term of Persic original, denoting a garden. See Paradise.
