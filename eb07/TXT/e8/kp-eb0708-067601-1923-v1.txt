EMATHIA, the ancient name of Macedonia, which was afterwards restricted to the country in the immediate vicinity of Edessa. This district was originally a part of Paeonia, and contained the extensive and fertile plains on the banks of the rivers Axius and Erigonus. (Polyb. Erag. xxiv. 8; Liv. X. 4, 11.) In the time of the Romans Emathia must have extended much farther to the south, as Ptolemy includes in this district the cities of Berrhoea and Pella.
