EIBENSTOCK, a city of the kingdom of Saxony, in the circle of Erzgeberg, and bailiwick of Krottendorf. It stands on the river Mulde, in a mining district, 1896 feet above the level of the sea, and contains 4397 inhabitants, employed chiefly in mining and preparing the metals; but the females make a large quantity of thread lace.

Ä½ICETAe, called also Heicetae and Hicet.e, were heretics of the seventh century, who made profession of the monastic life. From the passage in Exodus where Moses and the children of Israel are said to have sung a song in praise of the Lord, after they had safely passed the Red Sea, the Eicetae concluded that, in order to praise God aright, the introduction of singing and dancing was necessary; and as Mary the prophetess, sister of Moses and Aaron, beat a drum on the same occasion, an example which was followed by all the other women to express their joy, the Eicetae, in order the better to imitate them, enticed females to make profession of the monastic life, and assist in their mirth.
