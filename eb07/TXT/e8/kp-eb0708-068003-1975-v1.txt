EMBER Weeks are those in which A ∖ e ember ox embrvng days fall.

In the laws of King Alfred and those of Canute, these days are called yrnbren, that is, circular days, from which the word was probably corrupted into ember days. By the canonists they are called quatuor anni tempora, the four cardinal seasons on which the circle of the year turns; and hence Henshaw takes the word to have been formed by corruption from tempora. The ember days are the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, after Quadragesima Sunday, after Whitsunday, after Holy-rood day in September, and after St Lucia’s day in December; which four times answer well enough to the four quarters of the year, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Mr Somner thinks they were originally fasts, instituted in order to crave God’s blessing on the fruits of the earth; agreeably to which, Skinner supposes the word ember taken from the ashes, embers, then strewed on the head. These ember weeks are now chiefly taken notice of on account of the ordination of priests and deacons; because the canon appoints the Sundays next succeeding the ember weeks for the solemn times of ordination; though the bishops, if they please, may ordain on any Sunday or holiday.
