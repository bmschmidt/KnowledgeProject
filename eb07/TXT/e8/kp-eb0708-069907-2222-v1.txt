ENDRIE, a town of Asiatic Russia, in the district of Eastern Caucasus. It is situated on the river Akatsch, after it has left the mountains and spread into the plain, nearly about twenty miles from the Caspian Sea. It contains several mosques, an Arminian church, and two synagogues; and is the joint property of several Russian princes, who acknowledge the Russian authority. The inhabitants are chiefly Mahommeda≈Ñs, who allow the most complete toleration to the Georgian and Arminian Christians, and also to the Jews. The latter carry on an extensive commerce. The surrounding country is inhabited by savage tribes, who make frequent inroads on the peaceable inhabitants, and carry off slaves, whom they plunder and sell to the highest bidder, or keep till they are ransomed. Endrie is the seat of this extensive traffic, and is acknowledged as a free town by all the natives of the Caucasus; and it is a great commercial resort. It was formerly called Baal or Balek, and afterwards Endrie, from a governor by whom it was bravely defended against the Arabs. .. In 1722 it was sacked by the Russians.
