ECKIUS, or Echi√∫s, John, an eminent and learned controversialist, professor in the university at Ingolstadt, and remarkable for the opposition he gave to Luther, Melancthon, Carlostadius, and other leading Protestants in Germany, was born in Suabia in 1486. He wrote many polemical tracts; and amongst the rest a Manual of Controversies, printed in 1535, in which he discourses upon most of the heads contested between the Protestants and Roman Catholics. He also wrote a Commentary on Seligenstadt, 1536, Homilies, &c. ; and died in 1543.
