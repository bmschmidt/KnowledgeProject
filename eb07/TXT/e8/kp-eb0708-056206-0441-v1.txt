ELAPHEBOLIA, in Grecian antiquity, a festival observed in honour of Diana the huntress. In the celebration of this mystery a cake was made in the form of a deer (iλαpoς), and offered to the goddess. It owed its institution to a notable circumstance. When the Phocians had been severely beaten by the Thessalians, they resolved, by the persuasion of one Deiphantus, to raise a pile of combustible materials, and to burn their wives, children, and effects, rather than submit to the enemy. This flaming resolution was unanimously approved osby the women, who decreed Deiphantus a crown for his magnanimity. But when every thing was prepared, and just before they had fired the pile, they engaged their enemies, whom they totally routed, and thus obtained a complete victory. In commemoration of this unexpected success, the festival was instituted, and observed with the greatest solemnity.
