ELSINEUR, a city of Denmark, in the island Zealand. It was formerly a Hanse town, and is now the second city in Denmark proper. It is strongly fortified, and has a castle, Cronburg, designed to command the entrance of the Baltic Sea by the Sound; but in the English attacks on Copenhagen it was found of no avail. The passage of ships, who pay a toll, makes the town active and prosperous. It contains 552 houses and 5000 inhabitants, besides the garrison. The environs are pleasant and fruitful, and the castlc, with Hamletâ€™s Garden, as it is called, is visited by most English travellers who arrive at Elsineur. It is in long. 12. 35. 19. E. and lat. 56. 1. 40. N.
