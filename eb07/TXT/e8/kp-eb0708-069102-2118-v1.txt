EMIR, a title of dignity amongst the Turks, signifying a prince. This title was first given to the caliphs; but when they assumed the title of sultans, that of emir remained to their children, as that of Caesar among the Romans. At length the title came to be attributed to all who were judged to be descended from Mahommed by his daughter Fatima, and who consequently wear the green turban instead of the white. The Turks make an observation, that the emirs, before their fortieth year, are men of the greatest gravity, learning, and wisdom; but after this, if they are not great fools, they discover some signs of levity and stupidity. This is interpreted by the Turks as a sort of divine impulse in token of their birth and sanctity. The Turks also call the vizirs, pashas, or governors of provinces, by this name.
