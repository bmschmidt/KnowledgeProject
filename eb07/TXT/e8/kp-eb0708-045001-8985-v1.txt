EDULCORATION properly signifies the rendering substances more mild. Chemical edulcoration consists almost always in taking away acids and other saline substances; and this is effected by washing the bodies to which they adhere in a large quantity of water. The washing of diaphoretic antimony, powder of algaroth, and the like, until the water comes off quite pure and insipid, are instances of chemical edulcoration.
