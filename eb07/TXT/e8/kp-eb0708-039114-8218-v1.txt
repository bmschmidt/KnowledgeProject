EASTER, a festival of the Christian church, observed in memory of our Saviour’s resurrection. The Greeks call it pasgπ, the Latins pascha, from a Hebrew word signifying passage, applied to the Jewish feast of the passover. It is called Easter in English, from the goddess Eoβtre, who was worshipped by the Saxons with peculiar ceremonies in the month of April. The Asiatic churches kept their Easter upon the very same day on which the Jews observed their passovtr, and others on [7:8:392] the first Sunday after the first full moon in the new year. This controversy was determined in the council of Nice, when it was ordained that Easter should be kept upon one and the same day, which should always be a Sunday, in all Christian churches in the world.

Easter Island, an island in the South Sea, lying in Long. 109. 46. W. Lat. 27. 5. N. See the article Polynesia.
