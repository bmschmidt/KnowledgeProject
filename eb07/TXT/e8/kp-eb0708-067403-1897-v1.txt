ELOHI, Eloi, or Elohim, in Scripture, one of the names of God. But it is to be observed that angels, princes, great men, judges, and even false gods, are sometimes called by this name. The sequel of the discourse is what assists ns in judging rightly concerning the true meaning of this word. It is the same as Eloha, only the one is the singular and the other the plural. Nevertheless Elohim is often construed in the singular number, particularly when the true God is spoken of; but when false gods are spoken of, it is construed rather in the plural.
