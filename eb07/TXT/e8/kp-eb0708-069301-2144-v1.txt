EMPIRIC, an appellation given to those physicians who conduct themselves wholly by their own experience, or by arbitrary modes, without studying physic in a regular way. Some even use the term in a still worse sense, for a quack who prescribes at random, without being at all acquainted with the principles of the healing art.
