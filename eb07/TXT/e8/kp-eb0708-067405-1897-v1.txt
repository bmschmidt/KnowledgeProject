ELONGATION, in Astronomy, the digression or recess of a planet from the sun, with respect to an eye placed on our earth. The term is chiefly used in speaking of Venus or Mercury, the arch of a great circle intercepted between either of these planets and the sun being called the elongation of that planet from the sun.
