SYNONYMOUS is applied to a word or term that has the same import or signification with another. Several works have been composed for the express purpose of explaining synonymous words. In 1777 a work was published on the Latin synonymes at Paris by M. Gardin Dumesnil. The Abbé Girard published one on the synonymous terms of the French language many years ago. Another was published on the same subject in the year 1785 by the Abbé Roubaud. An account of the English synonymes was published by an anonymous author in 1766. This work is a close imitation, and in some parts a literal translation, of Girard’s “Synonymes François.” A rambling work, abounding with errors, was published by Mrs Piozzi, under the title of “British Synonymy.” Lond. 1794, 2 vols. 8vo. A much better book, more recently published, by Mr Crabb, is entitled “English Synonymes explained.” Lond. 1816, 8vo. Lond. 1826, 4to.
