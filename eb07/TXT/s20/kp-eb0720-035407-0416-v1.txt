SIMOGA, a fortified town of the south of India, in the province of Mysore, and district of Bednorr, situated on the Zunga or Zoom river. The fortifications are not strong, and are incapable of resisting a regular attack. It has a manufacture of cotton cloth in the neighbourhood. It contains the temple and convent of Kudali Sivami, the high priest of a sect of Mahratta Brahmins. In 1790, an action was fought near this place, between Purseram Bhow and Mahommed Reza, in which the Mahrattas were assisted by a detachment of British troops under Captain Little, who gained the battle. At this time Simoga contained 6000 houses, which were utterly destroyed by the Mahrattas. It was again destroyed in 1798, but has since considerably recovered its wealth and population. Long. 75. 35. E. Lat. 13. 51 N.
