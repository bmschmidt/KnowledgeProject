SEXAGENARY, something relating to the number sixty. Thus sexagenary or sexagesimal arithmetic is a method of computation proceeding by sixties, such as that used in the division of a degree into sixty minutes, of the minute into sixty seconds, and of the second into sixty thirds. Sexagenary tables are also tables of proportional parts, showing the product of two sexagenaries that are to be multiplied, or the quotient of the two that are to be divided.
