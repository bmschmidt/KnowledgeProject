SECHELLES, a cluster of high, rocky, and, generally speaking, barren islands, in the Indian Ocean, only three of which are inhabited. Cotton is the only product. There are twelve smaller islands, and as many islets or rocks, besides the larger ones. They abound in turtle, oysters, and particularly cocoa-nuts, which are imported by the inhabitants of the Mauritius. There are six decked vessels which belong to the inhabitants. Lat. 4. to 5. S.
