SOLOMON, the son of David king of Israel, renowned in Scripture for his wisdom, riches, and magnificent temple and other buildings. Towards the end of his life he sullied his former glory by his apostacy from God; from which cause vengeance was denounced against his house and nation. He died about 977 b.c. Solomon's Islands. This group is in the South Pacific ocean, situated chiefly between long. 155째 and 160째 E. lat. 5째 and 12째 S. Little is known of the precise situation or number of these islands. The longest are Ysabel, Guadalcanar, San Cristoval, and an island called New Georgia. The first two are affirmed by the Spaniards to be very large islands; the latter nearly seventy miles in extent. Georgia is still larger, and San Cristoval is not less than sixty. These islands were discovered in 1567.
