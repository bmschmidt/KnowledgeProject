SUCCADANA, a town on the west coast of the island of Borneo. It is situated on the principal or southern outlet of a large river, which is navigable 150 miles for prows. It is celebrated for very large diamonds, and also for the best camphire; and is a considerable mart for opium, the sale of which is monopolized by the rajah and his family. It is the custom here, as at all the eastern ports, to give a present at the first audience, in proportion to the rank of the person visited; to the king about fifty dollars, to the rajah thirty, and the shahbunder and agent about twenty each. Gold dust, tin, and pepper, are also to be procured here. Lat. 1. 30. S.
