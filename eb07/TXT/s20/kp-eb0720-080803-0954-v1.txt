SUMBHULPORE, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Gundwana, situated between the twenty-first and twenty-second degrees of north latitude. It is of an unwholesome atmosphere, especially to foreigners, owing to the mountainous and woody nature of the country, to the sudden vicissitudes of heat and cold, and to the quantity of jungle which it contains. The soil in the valleys is a rich loam, which produces sugar, cotton, and all kinds of grain; and in the mountains gold and diamonds are found. This district constituted the ancient kingdom of Gurrah, and was overrun by the armies of Aurungzebe. On the decline of the Mogul empire it became independent; and in the war between the British and the Mahrattas in 1803 several of the pergunnahs or parishes were taken possession of by the former. The capital, which is of the same name, is situated on the east side of the Mahanuddy river. Long. 83. 47. E. Lat. 21. 33. N.
