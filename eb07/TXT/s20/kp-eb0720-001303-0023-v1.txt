SCUTAGE (scutagium; Saxon, scildpening) was a tax or contribution raised by those that held lands by knights’ service, towards furnishing the king’s army, at one, two, or three merks for every knight’s fee. Henry III., for his voyage to the Holy Land, had a tenth granted by the clergy, and scutage, three merks of every knight’s fee, by the laity. This was also levied by Henry II., Richard I, and King John.
