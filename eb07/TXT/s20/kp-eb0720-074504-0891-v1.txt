STRAKES, or Streaks, in a ship, the uniform ranges of planks on the bottom and sides of a ship, or the continuation of planks joined to the ends of each other, and reaching from the stem to the stern-post and fashion-pieces; the lowest of these, which is called the garboard streak, is let into the keel below, and into the stem and stern post. They say also a ship heels a strake, that is, hangs or inclines to one side, the quantity of a whole plankâ€™s breadth.

Strakes, or Streks, in mining, are frames of boards fixed on or in the ground, where they wash and dress the small ore in a little stream of water, hence called stroked ore.
