SEGUE, in Italian music, is often found before aria, alleluja, amen, and some others, to show that those portions or parts are to be sung immediately after the last note of that part over which it is written; but if these words si placet, or ad libitum, are joined with it, it signifies that the portions may be sung or not at pleasure.
