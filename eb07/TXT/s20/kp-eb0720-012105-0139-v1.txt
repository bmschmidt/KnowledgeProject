SERONGE, a town of Hindustan, in the Mahratta territories, and province of Malwah. It is situated in a fine open country, well cultivated, and has the remains of ancient prosperity and greater population than at present. The bazaars are strong, and built of stone; and a large caravanserai still remains. The adjacent country is an open plain. It was formerly the scene of the Pindaric plunderers; and the villages are in consequence mostly in ruins. It is 165 miles north-east from Oojain, 389 from Benares, 595 from Bombay, 849 from Calcutta. Long. 78. E. Lat. 24. 8. N.
