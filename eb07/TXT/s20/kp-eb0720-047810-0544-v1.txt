SONG, in Music, in a general sense, applies to melody, whether vocal or instrumental. It is usually applied to an air adapted to the words of a short poem. Sometimes, with an adjunct, it means a particular form of melody, as plait; song (Fr. plain chant; Ital. canto piano, or canto ferma). Among songs, the most characteristic and interesting are the national ones of various countries. To the influence of national song may be traced those remarkable changes and improvements in the style of melody, with regard to free dom and expression, that are so perceptible in the music of professed composers within the last two centuries.
