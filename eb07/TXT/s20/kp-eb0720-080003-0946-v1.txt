SULPICIA, a Roman poetess, who lived under the reign of Domitian, and has been so much admired as to be termed the Roman Sappho. We have nothing, however, left of her writings but a satire, or rather the fragment of one, against Domitian, who published a decree for the banishment of philosophers from Rome. This satire is to be found in Scaligerâ€™s Appendix Virgiliana, and in other collections. It was separately published, with elaborate annotations by C. G. Schwartz. Altorf. 1721, 8vo. Harab. 1819, 4to. She is mentioned by Martial and Sidonius Apollinaris; and is said to have addressed a poem on conjugal love to her husband Calenus, a Roman knight.
