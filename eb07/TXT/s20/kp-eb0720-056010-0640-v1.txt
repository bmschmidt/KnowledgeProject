STANCHIONS, a sort of small pillars of wood or iron, used for various purposes in a ship, as to support the decks, the quarter-rails, the nettings, the awnings, &c. The first of those are two ranges of small columns fixed under the beams, throughout the shipâ€™s length between decks; one range being on the starboard and the other on the larboard side of the hatchways. They are chiefly intended to sup port the weight of the artillery.
