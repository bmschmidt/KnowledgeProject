SONGHUR, a town of Hindustan, in the Gujerat peninsula, situated in a wild country, twenty-five miles north west from Wankaneer. Near it is a very ancient temple dedicated to the sun, and adorned with a variety of sculptures, in a style greatly superior to any modern works by the Hindus. In the interior of this temple is a male figure, three feet high, with uplifted hands, each holding an image of the sun; and on his two sides are two smaller idols of the same kind. There are also two other temples, one of which contains the figure of Bhavani standing on an animal resembling a tortoise, and surrounded by female attendants. There is no record concerning the time when these temples were built
