STANNARY Courts, in Devonshire and Cornwall, for the administration of justice among the tinners. They are held before the lord-warden and his substitutes, by virtue of a privilege granted to the workers in the tin mines there, to sue and be sued only in their own courts, that they may not be drawn from their business, which is highly profitable to the public, by attending their lawsuits in other courts.
