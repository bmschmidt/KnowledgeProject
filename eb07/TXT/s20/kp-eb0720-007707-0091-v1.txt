SEIGNIOR, or Signior, is, in its general signification, the same with lord, but is particularly used for the lord of the fee or of a manor, as seigneur among the feudists is he who grants a fee or benefit out of the land to another; and the reason is, because, having granted away the use and profit of the land, the property or dominion he still retains in himself.
