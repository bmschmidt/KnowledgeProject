SEDAN-CHAIR is a covered vehicle for carrying a single person, being suspended by two poles, and borne by two men, who are hence denominated chairmen. They were first introduced into London in 1634, when Sir Sanders Duncomb obtained the sole privilege to use, let, and hire a number of the said covered chairs for fourteen years.
