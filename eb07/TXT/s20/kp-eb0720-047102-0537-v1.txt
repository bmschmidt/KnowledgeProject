SOFALA, or Sephala, a kingdom of Africa, lying on the east coast near Zanguebar. The name Sofala denotes, in the Hebrew and Arabic languages, low country. It has been celebrated by the Arabian geographers for its golden treasures, but it is from the interior that this precious metal is brought. The soil is fertile, and the climate tolerable. Numberless reefs and banks of sand render the approach dangerous. Long. 35. 40. E. Lat. 20. 20. S.
