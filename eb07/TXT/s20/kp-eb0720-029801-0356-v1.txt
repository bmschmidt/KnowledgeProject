SHIRE is a Saxon word signifying a division; but a county, comitatus, of the same import, is plainly derived from comes, the count of the Franks; that is, the earl or alderman, as the Saxons called him, of the shire, to whom the government of it was intrusted. This he usually exercised by his deputy, still called in Latin vi c e comes, and in English the sheriff, shrieve, or shire-reeve, signifying the officer of the shire; upon whom, in process of time, the civil administration of it totally devolved. In some counties there is an intermediate division between the shire and the hundred; as lathes in Kent and rapes in Sussex, each of them containing about three or four hundred a piece. These had formerly their lathe-reeves and rape-reeves, acting in subordination to the shire-reeve. Where a county is divided into three of these intermediate jurisdictions, they are called trythings, which were anciently governed by a trything-reeve. These trythings still subsist in the large county of York, w here, by an easy corruption, they are denominated ridings; namely, the north, the east, and the west ridings.
