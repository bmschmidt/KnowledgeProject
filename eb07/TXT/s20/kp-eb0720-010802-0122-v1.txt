SERIES, in general, denotes a continual succession of things in the same order, and having the same relation or connection with each other. In this sense we say, a series of emperors, kings, bishops, and the like.

In natural history, a series is used for an order or subdivision of some class of natural bodies; comprehending all such as are distinguished from the other bodies of that class, by certain characters which they possess in common, and which the rest of the bodies of that cast have not.
