STAMPHALIA, one of the islands of Greece, in the Archipelago, about twenty-seven square miles in extent. The surface consists of a single bare mountain, from which numerous springs issue, that render the lower parts capable of cultivation, and some spots are highly fertile. It contains about 800 inhabitants, who raise sufficient bar ley, wine, and fruit, for their consumption, and a large quantity of onions, which is the principal source of their trade. In a small island close to it are the remains of an ancient temple of Apollo. The number of partridges is so considerable, that to prevent their increase, from 10,000 to 12,000 of their eggs are taken every Easter. In the island there is a small town of the same name.
