SUBDEACON, an inferior minister, who anciently attended at the altar, prepared the sacred vessels, delivered them to the deacons in time of divine service, attended the doors of the church during communion service, and went on the bishopâ€™s embassies with his letters or messages to foreign churches. They were so subordinate to the superior rulers of the church, that, by a canon of the council of Laodicea, they were forbidden to sit in the presence of a deacon without his leave. According to the canon law, a person must be twenty-two years of age to be promoted to the order of sub-deacon.
