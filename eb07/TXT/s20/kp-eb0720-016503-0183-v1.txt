SEWALIC Mountains. This chain of mountains, which reaches a considerable elevation, divides the province of Delhi from Serinagur, in Northern Hindustan. It is through these mountains that the Ganges enters on the plains of Hindustan, at a place called Hurdwar. The hills, which rise with a moderate though unequal slope from the plains, are skirted with deep forests, which abound with valuable timber, and afford shelter to elephants. These, however, seldom exceed seven feet in height, and hence are not considered so valuable as those caught nearer the sea.
