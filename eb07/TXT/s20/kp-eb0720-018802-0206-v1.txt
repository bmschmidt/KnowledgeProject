SHAMANS are wizards or conjurers, in high repute among several idolatrous nations inhabiting different parts of Russia. By their enchantments they pretend to cure diseases, to divert misfortunes, and to foretell futurity. They are great observers of dreams, by the interpretation of which they judge of good or bad fortune. They pretend likewise to chiromancy, and to foretell a manâ€™s good or ill success by the lines of his hand. By these and such like means they have a very great ascendency over the understandings, and a great influence on the conduct, of those people.
