SHROUDS, a range of large ropes extending from the mast-heads to the right and left side of the ship, to support the masts, and enable them to carry sail.

The shrouds as well as the sails are denominated from the masts to which they belong. Thus there are the main, fore, and mizen shrouds; the main-top-mast, fore-top-mast, and mizen-top-mast shrouds; and the main-top-gallant, fore-top-gallant, and mizen-top-gallant shrouds. The number of shrouds by which a mast is sustained, as well as the size of the rope of which they are formed, is always in proportion to the size of the mast and the weight of the sail it is intended to carry.

Bowsprit shrouds are those which support the bowsprit. Bumpkin shrouds are those which support the bumpkins. Futtuck shrouds are shrouds which connect the efforts of the topmast shrouds to the lower shrouds. Bentick shrouds are additional shrouds to support the masts in heavy gales. Preventer shrouds are similar to bentick shrouds, and are used in bad weather to ease the lower rigging.
