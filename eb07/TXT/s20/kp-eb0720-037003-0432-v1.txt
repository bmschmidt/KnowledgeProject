SISYPHUS, in fabulous history, one of the descendants of Eolus, married Merope, one of the Pleiades, who bore him Glaucus. He resided at Epyra in Peloponnesus, and was a very crafty man. Others say, that he was a Trojan secretary, who was punished for discovering secrets of state; and others, that he was a notorious robber, who was killed by Theseus. All the poets, however, agree that he was punished in Tartarus for his crimes, by rolling a great stone to the top of a hill, which constantly recoiled, and rolling down incessantly, renewed his labour.
