SIMEON of Durham, the contemporary of William of Malmsbury. He took great pains in collecting the muniments of our history, especially in the north of England, after they had been scattered by the Danes. From these he composed a history of the kings of England, from A. D. 616 to 1130, with some smaller historical pieces. Simeon both studied and taught the sciences, and particularly the mathematics, at Oxford; and he became precentor of the church at Durham, where he died, probably soon after the conclusion of his history, which was continued by John, prior of Hexham, to the year 1156.
