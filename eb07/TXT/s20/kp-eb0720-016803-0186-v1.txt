SHAGREEN, or Chagreen, in commerce, a kind of grained leather prepared of the skin of a species of squalus, and much used in covering cases, books, and other articles. The best is that which is brought from Constantinople, and is of a brownish colour; the white is the worst. It is extremely hard, yet, when steeped in water, it becomes very soft and pliable; and hence it is of great use among case-makers. It takes any colour that is given to it, red, green, yellow, or black. It is frequently counterfeited, by using morocco formed like shagreen; but this last is distinguished by its peeling off, which the first does not.
