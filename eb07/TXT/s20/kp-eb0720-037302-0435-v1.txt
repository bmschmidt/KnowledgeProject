SKELETON, in Anatomy, the dried bones of any animal joined together by wires, or by the natural ligament dried, in such a manner as to show their position when the creature was alive.

In the Philosophical Transactions we have an account of a human skeleton, all the bones of which were so united as to make but one articulation from the back to the os sacrum, and downwards a little way. On sawing some of them where they were unnaturally joined, they were found not to cohere throughout their whole substance, but only about a sixth of an inch deep all round. The figure of the trunk was crooked, the spins making the convex, and the inside of the vertebrae the concave part of the segment. The whole had been found in a charnel-house, and was of the size of a full-grown person.
