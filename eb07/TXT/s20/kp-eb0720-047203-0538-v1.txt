SOLECISM in Grammar, a false manner of speaking, contrary to the rules of grammar, either in respect of declension, conjugation, or syntax. The word is Greek, σoλoικισμὸς, derived from the Soli, a people of Attica, who being transplanted to Cilicia, lost the purity of their ancient tongue, and became ridiculous to the Athenians for the improprieties into which they fell.
