SURPLICE, the habit of the officiating clergy in the Church of England. By Can. 58, every minister saying the public prayers, or ministering the sacrament or other rites of the church, shall wear a decent and comely surplice with sleeves, to be provided at the charge of the parish. But by 1 Eliz. c. 2, and 13 and 14 Car. IL, the garb prescribed by act of parliament, in the second year of King Edward VI. is enjoined; and this requires, that in the say- 'ng or singing of matins, and even songs, baptizing and burying, the minister in parish churches and chapels shall use a surpiice. And in all cathedral churches and colleges, the archdeacon, dean, provosts, masters, prabendaries, and[7:20:847] fellows, being graduates, may use in the choir, besides their surplices, such hoods as pertain to their several degrees; but in all other places every minister shall be at liberty to use a surplice or not. And hence, in marrying, churching of women, and other offices not specified in this rubric, and even in the administration of the holy communion, it seems that a surplice is not necessary. Indeed for the holy communion the rubric appoints a white alb plain, which differs from the surplice in being close-sleeved, with a vestment or cope.
