SHINGLES, in building, small pieces of wood, or quartered oaken boards sawn to a certain scantling, or, as is more usual, cleft to about an inch, thick at one end, and made like wedges, four or five inches in breadth and eight or nine inches in length.

Shingles are used instead of tiles or slates, especially for churches and steeples. This covering, however, is dear; yet, while tiles are very scarce, and a light covering is required, it is preferable to thatch; and where they are made of good oak, cleft, and not sawed, and well seasoned in water and the sun, they make a sure, light, and durable covering.
