SHAT-UL-ARAB, a large river, or rather canal, formed by the confluence of the Euphrates and the Tigris, before they enter the Persian Gulf. It forms a broad and splendid stream; and as far as Bassora, seventy miles from its mouth, it is navigable for vessels of 500 tons burden, It is generally supposed to fall into the Persian Gulf by various mouths; but this Colonel Kinneir, in his Geographical Memoir of the Persian Empire, shows to be a mistake, as those streams, supposed to be the mouths of the Shat-ul-Arab, are really the channels through which the great river Karoon pours its waters into the Gulf. With these six eastern channels the Shat-ul-Arab communicates by an artificial cut, and receives the waters of the Karoon.
