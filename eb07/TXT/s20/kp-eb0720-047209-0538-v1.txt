SOLICITOR, a person employed to take care of and manage suits depending in the courts of law or equity. There is also a great officer of the law, next to the attorney-general, who is styled the king or queen’s solicitor-general; who holds his office by patent during the sovereign’s pleasure, assists the attorney in managing the law business of the crown, and has fees for pleading, besides other fees arising by patents, &c. He attends on the privy-council; and the attorney-general and he were anciently reckoned among the officers of the Exchequer. They have their audience, and come within the bar in all the courts.
