SHADWELL, a large village of the county of Middlesex, in the hundred of Ossulston, touching on the city of London, but lower down on the same bank of the Thames, two miles and a half from St Paulâ€™s church. It is within the bills of mortality, and is a parish of itself. The population consists chiefly of sea-faring people, and of such as are connected with the building and equipment of shipping. The parish church is a large and handsome building, dedicated to St Paul. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 9557, and in 1831 to 9544. Many of the smaller houses, more than two hundred, have been taken down to make space for the docks that have been built, which accounts for the decrease in the population.[7:20:168]
