SHOT, a denomination given to all sorts of balls for firearms; those for cannon being of iron, and those for guns and pistols of lead.[7:20:319] case Shot formerly consisted of all kinds of old iron, nails, musket-balls, and stones, which were used as above.

Shot of a cable, on ship-board, is the splicing of two cables together, that a ship may ride safe in deep waters and in great roads; for a ship will ride easier by one shot of a cable, than by three short cables out ahead.
