SEIGNIORY is borrowed from the French seigneurie, which means dominatus, imperium, principatus, and signifies with us a manor or lordship, seigniory de sokemans. Seigniory in gross seems to be the title of him who is not lord by means of any manor, but immediately in his own person; as tenure in capite, by which one holds of the king, as of his crown, is seigniory in gross.
