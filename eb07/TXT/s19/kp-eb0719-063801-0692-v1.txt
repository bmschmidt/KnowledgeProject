SANCTIFICATION, the act of sanctifying, or rendering a thing holy. The reformed divines define sanctification to be an act of God’s grace, by which a person’s desires and affections are alienated from the world; and by which he is made to die to sin, and to live to righteousness, or, in other words, to feel an abhorrence of all vice, and a love of religion and virtue.
