SAPPERS are soldiers belonging to the royal artillery, whose business is to work at the saps. A brigade of sappers generally consists of eight men, divided equally into parties; and whilst one of these is advancing the sap, the other is furnishing the gabions, fascines, and other necessary implements. They relieve each other alternately.
