SCANNING, in Poetry, the measuring of verse by feet, in order to see whether or not the quantities be duly observed. The term is chiefly used in Greek and in Latin verses. Thus an hexameter verse is scanned by resolving it into six feet; a pentamcter, by resolving it into five feet; and so of the rest.
