SCHOOL, a public place, in which the languages, the arts, or sciences, are taught. Thus we say, a grammar school, a writing school, and a school of natural philosophy. The word is formed from the Latin schola, which, according to Du Cange, signifies discipline and correction. He adds, that it was anciently used for all places where several persons met together, either to study, to converse, or do any other matter. See EducatÎ¹on and Universities.
