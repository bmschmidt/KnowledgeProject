SALA, a city of Italy, in the province of Principato Citra, of the kingdom of Naples, situated on a small river of the same name. It is an inland place, situated on an elevated spot, and has a castle, five parish churches, and 6100 inhabitants. Another place of the same name in Italy is in the duchy of Parma, being situated on the river Baganza. It was the favourite residence of the last duchess, and now belongs to her successor, who keeps on the land belonging to it a large flock of merino sheep, with the view of extending that race throughout the country. There is another place in Sicily of the name, in the intendancy of Trapani, which is described as containing 9800 inhabitants, but ill built and disgustingly filthy.
