SAYPAN, one of the Ladrone Isles, in the Eastern Seas, about twenty miles in circumference. It was once the best peopled island of the Ladrones, but is now uninhabited; and very opposite accounts are given of its productiveness by different voyagers. Anson mentions that it presents as pleasant an aspect as Tinian; and on the west side of the island lies a safe and commodious port. Long. 145. 55. E. Lat. 15. 13. N.
