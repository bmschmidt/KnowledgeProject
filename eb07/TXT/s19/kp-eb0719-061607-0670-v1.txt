SALAD, or Sallad, a dish of eatable herbs, seasoned with salt, oil, and vinegar. MÃ©nage derives the word from the Latin salata, from sal, salt; but others from salcedo. Ducange derives it from salgama, which is used in Ausonius and Columella in the same sense. Some add mustard, hard eggs, and sugar. The principal salad herbs, and those which ordinarily make the basis of our English salads, are lettuce, celery, endive, cresses, radish, and rape.
