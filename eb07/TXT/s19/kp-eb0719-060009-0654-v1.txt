SACAeA, a feast which the ancient Babylonians and other orientals held annually in honour of the deity Anaitis. The Sacaea were in the East what the Saturnalia were at Rome, namely, a feast for the slaves. One of the ceremonies was to choose a prisoner condemned to death, and to allow him all the pleasures and gratifications he could wish, before he was carried to execution.
