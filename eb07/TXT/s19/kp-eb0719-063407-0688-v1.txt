SAMSOON, a port on the southern shore of the Black Sea, to the westward of Trebisond. It contains many well-built houses, seven mosques, one Armenian church, and 500 Ma-hommcdan and 200 Christian families. The vicinity has long been noted for silver and copper mines, two of which, lying between Samsoon and Kabback, and near the river Saracz Gourkhan, are deemed of gÏ„eat antiquity, and are called Malett and Jumbish. They have been recently opened anew. From the earliest times all these districts, to the very margin of the Euxine, have also been famous for workers in iron, and they bear the same reputation now as in ancient times.
