SAMSON, one of the judges of Israel, memorable for his supernatural strength, his victories over the Philistines, and his tragical end, as related in the book of Judges.

Samson’s Post, a sort of pillar erected in a ship’s hold, between the lower deck and the kelson, under the edge of a hatchway, and furnished with several notches that serve as steps to mount or descend, as occasion requires. This post being firmly driven into its place, not only serves to support the beam and fortify the vessel in that place, but also to prevent the cargo or materials contained in the hold from shifting to the opposite side, by the rolling of the ship in a heavy sea.
