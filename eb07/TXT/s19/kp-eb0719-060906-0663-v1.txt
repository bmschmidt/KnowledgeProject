SAFFRON is formed of the stigmata of the crocus officinalis, dried upon a kiln, and pressed together into cake;. There are two kinds of saffron, the English and Spanish; but the latter is by far the most esteemed. Saffron is principally cultivated in Cambridgeshire. This drug has been reckoned a very elegant and useful aromatic. Besides the virtues it has in common with other substances of the same class, it has been accounted one of the highest cordial.
