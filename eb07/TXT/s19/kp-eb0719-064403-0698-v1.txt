SANTORIN, one of the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea, and among the richest and best peopled of their number. It is about seventy-eight square miles in extent. Its appearance is that of a mountain perpendicularly cut downwards from the sea, composed of various volcanic matters, such as basalt, puzzolana, and pumice. The surface is much covered with the latter substance in almost every part, but mixed with good vegetable mould. This soil is peculiarly adapted to the growth of wine, of which a vast quantity is made, and forms the chief drink, as there is little and in many parts no good water, but rain that is preserved. Some barley is grown, but far short of what is consumed. There are some figs, almonds, and pulse, and a little cotton wool, raised. The inhabitants amount to twelve thousand, all Greeks, some adhering to the Greek religion, but some are Catholics, and each sect has its own bishop. There are five small towns and several villages. The capital is on the east side, and called Emporia. Long. 26. 15. E. Lat. 36. 21. N.
