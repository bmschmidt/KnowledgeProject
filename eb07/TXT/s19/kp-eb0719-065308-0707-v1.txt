SATURNALIA, in Roman antiquity, a festival observed about the middle of December, in honour of the god Saturn, whom Lucan introduces giving an account of the ceremonies observed upon this occasion. “During my whole reign,” says he, “which lasts but for one week, no public business is done; there is nothing but drinking, singing, playing, creating imaginary kings, placing servants with their masters at table, &c. There shall be no disputes or reproaches, but the rich and poor, masters and slaves, shall be equal.” On this festival the Romans sacrificed bareheaded, contrary to their custom at other sacrifices.
