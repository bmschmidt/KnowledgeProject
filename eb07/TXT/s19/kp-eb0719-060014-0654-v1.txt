SACKBUT, a musical instrument of the wind kind, being a sort of trumpet, though different from the common trumpet both in form and size. It is fit to play a bass, and is contrived to be drawn out or shortened, according to the tone required, whether grave or acute. The Italians call it trombone, and the Latins tuba ductilis.
