SABAZIA, in Greek antiquity, were nocturnal mysteries in honour of Jupiter Sabazius. All the initiated had a golden serpent put in at their breasts, and taken out at the lower part of their garments, in memory of Jupiterâ€™s ravishing Proserpina in the form of a serpent. There were also other feasts and sacrifices distinguished by this appel lation, in honour of Mithras, the deity of the Persians, and of Bacchus, who was thus denominated by the Sabians, a people of Thrace.
