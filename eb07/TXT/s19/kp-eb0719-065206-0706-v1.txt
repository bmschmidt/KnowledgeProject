SASHES, in military dress, are badges of distinction, worn by the officers of most nations, either round their waist or over their shoulders. Those for the British army are made of crimson silk; for the imperial army, of crimson and gold; for the Prussian army, of black silk and silver; for the Hanoverians, of yellow silk; and for the Portuguese, of crimson silk with blue tassels.
