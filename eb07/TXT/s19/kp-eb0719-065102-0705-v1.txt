SARDONIUS Risus, Sardonian Laughter, a convulsive involuntary laughter, so named from the herba sardonia, which is a species of ranunculus, and is said to produce such convulsive motions in the cheeks as resemble those motions which are observed in the face during a fit of laughter. This complaint is sometimes speedily fatal. If the ranunculus happens to be the cause, the cure must be attempted by means of a vomit, and frequent draughts of hydromel with milk.
