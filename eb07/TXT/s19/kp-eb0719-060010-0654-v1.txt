SACCHARUM, Sugar, or the Sugar-cane. This plant is a native of Africa, the East Indies, and Brazil; whence it was introduced into our West India islands soon after they were settled. The sugar-cane is the glory and the pride of those islands. It amply rewards the industrious planter, enriches the British merchant, gives bread to thousands of ma nufacturers and seamen, and brings an immense revenue to the crown. See Sugar.
