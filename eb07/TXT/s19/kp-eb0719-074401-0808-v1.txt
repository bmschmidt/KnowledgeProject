STATISTICS.

Scotland , the northern division of Great Britain, is situated between 54° 38' and 58° 41' north latitude, and between 1° 47' and 6° 7' west longitude from Greenwich; having the sea on all sides, except the south, where it is separated from England partly by the Tweed and other streams, and partly by a line supposed to be drawn along the high grounds in that quarter. The longest line that can be drawn in about the same parallel of longitude is from the Mull of Galloway in Wigtonshire to Cape Wrath in Sutherland, a distance of about 274 miles, though Dunnet-head in Caithness-shire, is the most northerly point; while its breadth is extremely various, ranging from 147 miles to about 30. The greatest breadth is between Buchanness on the coast of Aberdeenshire, and the Rowanmoan Point on the west coast of Ross-shire. There are other points where the width is not much less; while between Alloa on the

Frith of Forth and Dunbarton on the Clyde, the distance is only 32 miles, and between Lochbroom and the Frith of Dornoch, it is rather less than 30. The area of Scotland, calculated from Arrowsmith’s map, and as given in the General Survey of Scotland, contains 25,520 square miles, and 494 square miles of fresh water lakes. This is the extent of the mainland only, exclusive of the islands on the west, known by the name of the Hebrides or Western Isles; and those of Orkney and Zetland on the north, which altogether are computed to extend over 4224 square miles, of which 144 consist of fresh water lakes. Including these islands, the northern limit of Scotland stretches beyond the 61st degree of latitude, and its longitude lies between the meridian of London and 8°18' west; its area being computed to comprehend 30,238 square miles, of which the fresh water lakes occupy 638 square miles, or about l-48th part of the whole.

From what has been already said respecting the extreme variation in the breadth of Scotland at different places, the fact may be inferred, that the outline on the sea-coast is exceedingly irregular, and of great extent, the sea penetrating to a great depth, both on its eastern and western sides. Of these arms of the sea, the most considerable are the Firths of Forth and Tay, and the Moray and Dornoch Firths, on the east; and the Firth of Clyde and the Luce and Wigton Bays, on the west and south-west; whilst there are a very great number of smaller inlets, called lochs, such as Loch Fyne, Loch Long, Loch Etive, Loch Lynnhe, Loch Broom, &c., which indent the country in all directions, to an extent varying from ten to seventy miles. With this irregularity of outline is combined a surface generally rugged and mountainous. With the exception of narrow tracts along its principal rivers, there is very little of the country flat or level, or what would be regarded as productive land in more favoured regions. “To such a degree,” says Mr. M'Cullocb, “is this the case, that, estimating the whole extent of the country, exclusive of lakes, at 19,000,000 acres, it is doubtful whether so many as 6,000,000 be arable; whereas, taking the extent of England and Wales at 37,000,000 acres, the arable land certainly exceeds 29,000,000; so that, while in Scotland, the proportion of the cultivable to the entire land is less than one-third, in England it exceeds three-fourths. With the exception, indeed, of a few tracts of rich alluvial land, (carses), Scotland has no very extensive vales; the surface of the rest of the country being, even where most level, considerably varied with hill and dale.”^[1. Statistical Account of Great Britain, vol. i. p. 239.] In the south of Scotland, a tract of mountainous country, known by various names, stretches in a south-west direction, from the Cheviot hills in Roxburghshire, on the borders of England, to the Irish channel, sending off branches on both sides, whilst detached hills prevail over the whole of the contiguous districts. These high grounds, however, are for the most part clothed in green, almost to their summits, and have little of that wild, romantic, and desolate character, which distinguishes many of the mountains of the Highlands. Northward from the isthmus formed by the Firths of Forth and Clyde, the low grounds constitute but a small proportion of the whole. Here, in latitude 57°, the Grampians extend from sea to sea, with a breadth of from forty to sixty miles; and parallel to them, to the south, is another chain, called the Siedlaw, Ochills, and Campsie hills. Between these two ranges lies the fertile valley of Strathmore; whilst, farther north, cultivation is mostly confined to the sea-coast, the banks of the larger rivers, and the narrow glens between the mountains. On the north-west, beyond the line of the Caledonian canal, the country is, with few exceptions, singularly rugged and sterile; consisting of lofty mountains, cither covered with heath, or presenting a mass of naked rocks, interrupted only by deep and dark ravines, lakes, and precipitous streamlets. But the eastern coast of Ross-shire is comparatively level and fertile; and Caithness, the north-eastern county of the mainland of Scotland, is generally low, marshy, and unproductive.

Scotland is divided into Highlands and Lowlands. “Those countries, whose inhabitants speak a different language, and wear a different garb,” says Mr. Home, in his History of the Rebellion, 1745,^[2. Home’s Works, vol. iii. 385, 386.] ^ “are not separated by firths or rivers, nor distinguished by northern or southern latitude. The same shire, the same parish, at this day, contains part of both; so that a Highlander and Lowlander (each of them standing at the door of the cottage where he was born) hear their neighbours speak a language which they do not understand.” The line which separates the Highlands from the Lowlands is by no means well defined; but it may be described as beginning at Dunbarton, on the Firth of Clyde, and proceeding northward by Crieff, Dunkeld, and Blair gowrie, it runs through the forest of Morven, in the heights of Aberdeen, to Carron, in Banffshire; from Carron it stretches due west by Tarnoway, in Morayshire, to the town of Nairn; from Nairn the line is continued to Inverness; and from this latter place, it proceeds in a tortuous direction, to Dunistra, on the south side of the Firth of Dornoch, where the line of separation may be said to terminate, the country to the north of this firth being altogether Highland, except a narrow stripe of land along the shores of the German Ocean, which washes the east coast of Sutherland and Caithness. To the west of this line lie the Highlands, which, including the Hebrides, constitute in superficial extent nearly one-half of Scotland, although the inhabitants of this division do not form an eighth part of the population of that kingdom. The face of the country is wild, rugged, desolate, and mountainous. In almost every strath, valley, or glen, there glitters a stream or lake; and numberless firths, or arms of the sea, penetrate the land. The passes into the Highlands lie in deep ravines or glens, so narrow, and soover-hung by mountains, that they admit of being very easily defended, and till recently, when roads have been made, they were impracticable almost to every one except the natives. To this must principally be ascribed the successful resistance opposed by the Highlanders to the attacks of the Romans and the Saxons; and hence, also, these northern people still form a distinct race, the lineal descendants of the ancient Celtic inhabitants of the country, and differing essentially in language, dress, and manners, from the Lowlanders..

The climate of Scotland, as may be expected, from its insular situation and high latitude, is cold, cloudy, and humid. This is its general character, as compared with the greater part of England; yet, even in the south of England, frost is sometimes more intense, and snow falls more copiously than in Scotland. Corn, however, and most of the fruits and vegetables common to both divisions of Great Britain, attain maturity about three weeks earlier in the south of England than in Scotland; and some plants, such as hops and a few others, cannot be profitably cultivated at all in the latter country. The mean annual temperature of Scotland is very high for the latitude, being about 46 ½ ° in places near the level of the sea. In the more southerly parts of the kingdom, the climate differs but little from that of the northern parts of England. Sir David Brewster states the mean annual temperature to be 48 36 at Leith. At Edinburgh, which is elevated from 300 to 400 feet above the level of the sea, and situated two miles from it, the annual temperature is 47∙8, and this may be taken as a near approximation to the general average of Scotland; the mean temperature of winter being 38∙6, of spring, 46∙4, of summer, 58∙2, of autumn, 48∙4, the coldest month being 38∙3, and the warmest 59·4.^[3. Ibid.] The observations published in the New Statistical Account of Scotland, and in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, closely approximate to the above estimate. In the parish of Inch, Wigtonshire, the mean temperature for the year 1837 was 48∙41. At Applegarth Manse, in the interior of Dumfriesshire, the average annual temperature for seven successive years, ending in 1831 inclusive, was 47Ί2; that of the spring being 40∙31, of the summer, 56∙86, the autumn, 54∙18, and of winter, 39·92. At Wick in Caithness the mean annual temperature is 46∙7, that of the winter being 40∙35, the spring, 44∙4l, the summer, 5377, and the autumn, 48·82; whilst at Sumburgh-head, the most southerly promontory of the Shetland Islands, in latitude 59° 52', the mean annual temperature is 45 ∙5, that of the winter being 40, the spring, 43·29, the summer, 50∙60, and the autumn, 47∙48. The range of the barometer is 2∙82 inches, or from 30·92 to 28· 10 inches; and in the Orkney and Shetland Islands it is somewhat more, or about three inches. The fall of rain is very diffcr-[7:19:746] ent in different districts; but the average is about 31 inches. The quantity which falls on the east coast of Scotland ranges from 22 to 26 inches; whilst, on the west coast and in the Hebrides, it is nearly double, varying, according to situation, from 35 to 46 inches. The number of fair days throughout the year is, on the west coast, only 160; whilst on the east it is 230. The mean annual fall of rain at Edinburgh for the years 1824 and 1825, was 23 ½ inches; at Glasgow, for an average of thirty years, it was 30 inches; whilst, still farther west, at Mount Stewart, in the Isle ofBute, it was, on an average of seven years, 46∙6 inches, the mean average of the whole country being, as just stated, 31 inches. The prevailing winds throughout Scotland are from the westerly points; but on the east coast it blows from the easterly points about a third of the year. Easterly winds generally prevail in March and April., and often in May and part of June, and not only check vegetation, but are attended with slightly unfavourable effects on the health of the inhabitants, particularly such of them as are nervous, dyspeptic, consumptive, or rheumatic. But the climate of Scotland is eminently salubrious. There are, properly speaking, no fens or marshes. The low grounds are, in general, highly cultivated. From whatever point the wind may blow, except the east, a wide expanse of sea is passed ever; and the air, though moist, is purified from injurious emanations, which are readily absorbed by the ocean. Hence it has been affirmed, that the mean duration of life is greater in Scotland than in almost any other country.^[4. Malthus, i. cap. x.] “We are pretty confident, from extensive observation in different countries, that the proportion of the population that reaches seventy or eighty years of age, and the vigour then remaining, are greater in Scotland than almost any where else.”

The mountains of Scotland consist either of detached groups, more or less closely wedged together, or of ridges or chains. These latter may be characterized as running in a north-east and south-west direction. The most celebrated chain, the Grampians, mentioned by Tacitus,^[5. Agricolae Vita, c. 29.] extend from the south-eastern boundaries of Argyleshire, with a more or less defined line, to the heart of Aberdeenshire. This chain may be regarded as a natural rampart, forming the south-eastern boundary of the Highlands. With the exception of Ben Nevis, the highest mountains in Scotland arc comprehended in the Grampian range. Another chain, to the south of the Grampians, and nearly parallel to them, stretches from Montrose to the Clyde, in Dunbartonshire; but being intersected by the Tay and the Forth, it is divided into three distinct portions, which bear different names. From Montrose to the Tay, this chain is called the Siedlaw hills; from the Tay to the Forth, it is known by the name of the Ochills; and the remainder passes under the names of the Dundaff, Fintry, and Campsie hills. The low-country, or strath, which separates this range of hills from the Grampians, is called Strathmore, or the great valley. There is also a chain of mountains in the south of Scotland, stretching from the Cheviot hills, on the borders of Northumberland, to Loch Ryan, in Wigtonshire. There are other smaller ranges, such as the Monagh Lea mountains, which run parallel to and along the western side of the Spey; the Lomond hills in Fifeshire; the Pentland hills in Mid-Lothian, and others. The altitude and situation of the principal hills and mountains in Scotland having already been given under the head of Physical Geography, it is unnecessary to repeat the information here.

In the neighbourhood of the village of Leadhills, in Lanarkshire, 1564 feet above the level of the sea, is the highest cultivated land in Scotland. In Aberdeenshire, the plough sometimes reaches the height of about 1300 feet; but, with few exceptions, an elevation of 600 feet seems to be the limit of the tillage lands of Scotland. None of the Scottish mountains ascends to the line of perpetual congelation; yet snow may be found all the year round in some of the dark recesses, on which the sun never shines.

From the rugged and mountainous character of the surface of Scotland, the vales or level tracts cannot be expected to be extensive or numerous. They are, indeed, when compared with England, very much the reverse. Of these vales, called sometimes straths or carses, the following are the most important The vale or carse of Stirling and Falkirk is a tract of low alluvial land, which extends on both sides of the Forth, with little interruption, and to a greater or less width, from Borrowstonness to about twenty miles north of Stirling, including the vales of the Teith and the Allan, two tributaries of the Forth. These lands are peculiarly fertile, and produce the richest crops of wheat and other grain. The vale of the Earn, a tributary of the Tay, known by the name of Strathearn, is of a similar character, but of comparatively limited extent. The carse of Gowrie, which lies on the north of the Tay, from Dundee to Perth, is incomparably the most fertile and productive district in Scotland, and is thought not to be surpassed in these respects by any other district of equal extent in the united kingdom. Strathmore stretches from Lawrencekirk in Angusshire to the neighbourhood of Perth, lying between the bases of the Siedlaw hills and the Grampians. This valley is not entirely flat, but is characterised by occasional gentle eminences. The Merse, or level lands of Berwick shire, stretch from the confluence of the Leader and the Tweed to the town of Berwick, occupying most of the low and generally level part of the country, or nearly the half of its surface. The carse of Baldoon, lying south of the river Bladenoch, and on the east shore of the bay of Wigton, is of limited extent, but of nearly equal fertility to the carse of Gowrie. There are other less important straths or carses, such as those along the Teviot in Roxburghshire; Tynedale, or the vale of Tyne, in East Lothian; and the Howe, or vale of Eden, in Fifeshire. These lands are either loamy or alluvial.

By this term we mean tracts of land composed of morasses, intermixed with rocks, lakes, and peat-moss. The moor of Rannoch, lying between Schehallion, Ben Cruachan, and Ben Nevis, is one of the most lonely, wild, and dreary districts in Scotland. It may be said to be entirely devoid of value, and would not of itself bring any rent. It is not inhabited, and very seldom visited. There is a tract about ten miles inland on the west coast of Sutherlandshire, not very dissimilar, but, though more rugged, it is not quite so dreary as that of the moor of Rannoch. The flow of Glenluce lies between Newtonstewart and Luce Bay, stretching along the public road for about ten miles, composed chiefly of peat and morasses, and forming one of the bleakest and most dreary rides in Scotland.

From the rugged and mountainous nature of the country, the rivers of Scotland are characterised by a more rapid course, are more diversified by rocks and cataracts, and are more limpid than those of England. Their course is also necessarily shorter, and few of them are navigable, at least to any great extent. Being generally mountain streams, they are peculiarly liable to sudden overflowings, their rise and fall being equally sudden. From a very tedious and elaborate set of experiments, it is computed that they carry out to the sea, on an average, about 1 / 2000 the weight of their waters in mud; that is, a film of about 1 / 50 of an inch annually, or one inch in fifty years over the whole surface from which they draw their waters.

The principal rivers of Scotland, with the single exception of the Clyde, are exclusively confined to the east. Three inconsiderable rivers flow in a south-easterly direction, the[7:19:747] Dee, which falls into the Solway Firth about six miles south of Kirkcudbright, and is navigable for small vessels two miles above that town; the Nith, which rises in the north of Dumfries-shire, and falls into the Solway Firth more than seven miles below Dumfries, being navigable to within two miles of that place; and the Annan, which rises on the south side of Hartfell, near Moffat, and falls into the same estuary at the town of Annan. The last is not navigable beyond this burgh. The rivers which flow in a northerly or north-easterly direction are the Ness, which flows from Loch Ness, and, after a short course, falls into the Moray Firth near Inverness; the Findhorn, which, rising in the Monagh Lea mountains, falls into the same estuary at Findhorn, after a winding course of upwards of 50 miles; and the Spey, the most rapid of the Scottish rivers, which flows from Loch Spey towards the west of Inverness-shire, and, after receiving innumerable tributaries, and traversing the best wooded portion of the Highlands, falls into the Moray Firth. The course of the Spey is nearly 100 miles; it drains above 1300 square miles of country, but is not navigable. With the exception of the Ayr, which is likewise not navigable, and falls into the sea at the town of the same name, the only river on the west coast worth mentioning, is the Clyde, (the Glotta of Tacitus), which, in a manufacturing and commercial point of view, is the most important stream in Scotland. It rises on the west of the Moffat mountains, and, after a circuitous course of nearly eighty miles, falls into the Firth of Clyde below Dunbarton. It receives various tributaries, and is navigable to Glasgow, passing in its course the principal manufacturing and commercial towns in Scotland; Glasgow, Hamilton, Lanark, Paisley, Port-Glasgow, and Greenock. The navigation of the Clyde was formerly much obstructed; but under the management of a Parliamentary board, called the River Trust, these obstructions have been nearly removed, and the channel rendered so deep and straight that vessels of 400 tons can now resort to the Broomielaw at Glasgow. The falls of Clyde, which are about 30 miles south-east of Glasgow, are very striking and celebrated. The first considerable fall is that of Bonnington, its height, including that of a little one immediately above it, being about thirty feet. The second is Corra Linn, where the water dashes from one shelving rock to another, its perpendicular height being about seventy feet. Dundaff fall is only ten feet in height; whilst that of Stonebyres, which includes three distinct falls, is not less than seventy-six feet.^[6. Naiamith’s Survey of Clydesdale, p. 19, &c.] All the other rivers are on the east coast, namely, the Tweed, the Forth, the Tay, the North and South Esk, the Dee, and the Don. The Tweed rises near the sources of the Annan and Clyde, and running past Peebles through a beautiful pastoral country, falls into the German ocean at Berwick-upon-Tweed, after a winding course of about a hundred miles. The descent from its source to its embouchure is about 1500 feet; and it is navigable only to Berwick. The Forth, (the Bodotria of Tacitus), rises on the east of Ben Lomond, and receiving the waters of the Teith and the Allan, it becomes a considerable stream at Stirling, to which the tide flows, and to which it is navigable for vessels of about seventy tons. From Stirling to Alloa is only six miles by land, but the stream of the Forth is so tortuous that it is no less than sixteen by water. The river may here be said to terminate in the Firth, which extends to the German ocean, a distance of forty miles. Its width is various. At Queensferry, eight miles west of Edinburgh, it is two miles; at Leith it is six; and thence it gradually expands till it is lost in the open sea. It is navigable for vessels of 300 tons as far as Alloa. The only low water pier of which it can boast is that of Granton, about a mile and a half west of Leith. The Tay rises to the north of Loch Lomond, and expanding into the romantic sheet of water called Loch Tay, it flows in a circuitous route past Dunkeld and Perth, and falls into the Firth of Tay at the confluence of its waters with the Earn, about twenty miles from the mouth of the estuary. It is navigable to Dundee for vessels of 500 tons burthen, and to Perth for those of 100 tons. It receives many tributaries, of which the Earn, just mentioned, is the most important. The Tay is the largest of the Scottish, and, in respect to the volume of water it conveys to the sea, even of the British rivers. The North and South Esk have their source in the Grampians, and fall into the sea at Montrose, within three miles of each other. The South Esk is navigable to Montrose, about a mile and a half from its mouth. The North Esk is not navigable. The basin of Montrose, through which the South Esk flows, and which bounds the town on the west, comprehends about 2000 acres of land; it is covered by water at full sea, and exhibits nothing but bare sand at ebb tide. This expanse, it has been calculated, might be reclaimed at a gross cost of L.11,938.^[7. Quarterly Journal of Agriculture, March 1838.] The Dee and the Don have also their rise in the Grampians, and fall into the sea, the former at New Aberdeen, and the latter at Old Aberdeen. The Dee is navigable for about a mile from its mouth; the Don is not navigable.

The Scottish rivers, as stated at the beginning of this head, are of such a character, that there is no room for reclaiming waste land from their channels. This is prevented by the rapidity of their streams and by their rugged course. But several attempts have been made to reclaim lands from innundation on the shores of the Firths of Forth and Tay. Without entering into particulars the following results may be given:^[8. ’ ibid. for December 1837.]
[table]

In addition to this, it has been stated that the extent of land now in process of being reclaimed, on different estates on the shores of the Tay, may be computed at 1140 acres, at a gross cost of L.50 per acre. The following extract, on the subject of embankments, from a work just published,^[9. New Statistical Account of Scotland, part xxiii. p. 631.] contains minute and interesting information; “About 68 Scots acres of land have been here, (the parish of St. Madoes,) at different times reclaimed from the Tay by embankments. In 1826, in consequence of an arrangement between Sir John Richardson, the proprietor, and Mr. R.W. Rannie, tenant, Pitfour Mains, by which the latter agreed to raise an embankment at his own expense, and after being allowed to take the first crop free, to pay L.4, 10s. annually, per Scots acre, for the reclaimed land, during a lease of nineteen years; operations were commenced, which resulted in the complete reclamation of 50 acres during the autumn of that year. The whole expense of embankments, sluices, levelling, water cuts, and trenching amounted to L.1530. So productive, however, did the new soil turn out, that Mr. Rannie has been amply rewarded for his enterprise. According to his own account, he has had, before liming and manuring, on some parts of a field, about 60 bolls of potatoes per acre, the average produce being from 40 to 50 bolls. After liming and manuring, he has had, on some parts of a field, 70 bolls per acre, the average being from 50 to 60 bolls, of 32 stones Dutch to[7:19:748] the boll. He has had of oats, before liming and manuring, from 10 to 11, after liming and manuring, from 12 to 13 quarters per acre; and of wheat from 6 to 7 quarters per acre. He commenced liming in 1829 and manuring in 1835, the rotation, up to that period, being potatoes, and wheat, or oats, alternately. In 1833, Sir John Richardson reclaimed 18 acres more at an expense of L.1200; and, by means of head-dikes, break-waters, and other contrivances, which he is from time to time throwing out into the river, for the purpose of accommodating silt, upwards of 150 acres more may ultimately be added to the parish; of these, from 15 to 20 may be banked off in the course of two years.”

From a table already given, under the head of Superficial Extent, we have already found that the fresh water lakes in Scotland occupy an area of 638 square miles, or cover an aggregate extent of 408,320 English statute acres. The only counties that are devoid of lakes are those of Berwick, Clackmannan, the Lothians, and Peebles; whilst those of Roxburgh amount to only 320 English acres. The greatest extent of lakes are in Inverness-shire, (84,480 English acres,) Argyleshire, exclusive of islands, (38,400,) Ross-shire, (38,400,) Perthshire, (32,000,) and Sutherlandshire, (30,080.) The lakes, generally speaking, occupy the valleys or ravines amongst the mountains, and are thus distinguished for their length, their breadth being comparatively trifling. The only Lowland lakes worth specifying are Loch Leven, St. Mary’s Loch, and Loch Ken. The first, situated in Kinross-shire, is four miles in length by two in breadth, having the Lomond hills on its east, and Benarty hill on its south; whilst the towns of Kinross and Milnathort lie on its western margin. This lake is remarkable for a peculiar species of red trout, which is highly valued;^[10. Statistical Account of Scotland.] * and it also produces char, perch, pike, and other species of fish. The fishery is let for a considerable sum; and it is a remarkable fact that Loch Leven is the only Scottish lake that yields any revenue to its proprietors. There is not even an attempt made to derive any profits from any other lake; nay, they are not fished for the domestic consumption even of the neighbouring inhabitants. But Loch Leven is principally celebrated for an island in the lake in which are the picturesque ruins of a castle, where Queen Mary was confined by her subjects, and from which she effected her escape (1568) a few days previous to the fatal battle of Langside. There are other small islands in the lake, the principal of which is St. Serf’s, where was once a famous monastery, of which Andrew Winton, author of the Chronykil of Scotland, was prior. St. Mary’s Loch, a most beautiful and picturesque sheet of water, three miles in length by from half a mile to a mile in breadth, is in Selkirkshire. Loch Ken is formed by the expansion of the river Ken in Kirkcudbrightshire, and forms part of the river. It is ten miles in length by rather less than a mile in breadth. The other lakes are all north of the Firths of Clyde and Forth. Loch Lomond is the most celebrated as well as the largest lake in Scotland; indeed, it is the largest in the British dominions. This noble sheet of water is above twenty-four miles in length, its greatest breadth is ten miles, but, towards its upper part, it is not more than half a mile. Its depth varies from twenty to a hundred and twenty fathoms, and its greatest depth is towards the north. It is studded with numerous and richly wooded islands, some of them being very small, but the largest, Inchmurrin, is two miles in length and one in breadth. Some of them, particularly Inchmurrin, are stocked with deer. Both sides of the lake are flanked by high and rugged mountains, among which “the lofty Ben Lomond” stands conspicuous, its height being 3195 feet above the margin of the water. The surface water of Loch Lomond is from three to five feet higher in winter than in summer; but its mean height is about twenty-two feet above the level of the sea at Dunbarton. Its surplus water is convey ed to the Clyde, a distance of six miles, by the river Leven. Loch Katterin, so celebrated in Sir Walter Scott’s Lady of the Lake, lies in the district of Menteith, Perthshire, and is one of the most romantic in Scotland. Its length is eight miles, and its greatest breadth less than one. It does not seem necessary to give a minute description of the other lakes; but the following table, taken from the General Report of Scotland, will shew their number, dimensions, and situation.
[table]

In a general point of view, Scotland may be separated, geologically as well as geographically, into three portions. By passing a line on the map nearly straight from Stonehaven, through Dunkeld, to the middle of the Isle of Bute, and thence with a slight curve to the Mull of Cantyre, we shall have traced the southern boundary of the primary nonfossiliferous system of rocks. Another line, but much more irregular than the former, drawn from St. Abb’s Head in Berwickshire, passing near Peebles, Sanquhar, and New Cumnock, to the south of Girvan on the western coast, will form a general parallelism with the former line, and will contain the old greywacke, now named the Cumbrian system, lying to the south, and extending to the boundary between England and Scotland, whilst the land included between the two lines comprehends the old red sandstone, and great central basin of Scotland.

That extensive tract of Scotland which constitutes the northern division, is composed chiefly of gneiss, mica slate, chlorite slate, and clay slate, with subordinate masses of hornblende slate, talc slate, and primitive limestone. These, with granitic centres, often rise into magnificent mountains, of which the Grampians form a part. In many of these deposits, particularly in the mica slate, garnets of a brown colour are very abundant. In the primary deposits no organic remains have ever been discovered.

These, however, are not the only stratified formations which constitute this extensive district. The old red sandstone fringes the extremities of the land, commencing near the[7:19:749] Moray Firth, extending on both sides of Loch Ness till within a short distance of Fort Augustus, and then proceeding northward, expanding the whole breadth of Caithness, and constituting the principal formation of the Orkney Isles. On the western site of the mainland, the old red sandstone is deposited in numerous patches on the gneiss formation, as at Loch Broom, Gairloch, and Applecross.

The new secondary rocks have been but sparingly observed in Scotland; yet it is a curious fact that the few patches that have been discovered are superimposed on the old red sandstone, and have not been reposing in uninterrupted order in the secondary series. Thus the lias shales, highly micaceous, and some of the upper beds of the oolitic system, occur at the mouth of the Cromarty Firth, from Dunrobin Castle to the ord of Caithness, Applecross, and other points on the mainland, and in the Western Islands, on the borders of Mull, the south and east of Skye, and near to the rocks of Arran. The equivalent of the fresh water deposits of the wealds of Sussex, geologically situated above the oolitic group and below the chalk, is seen in Moray and Skye. In the central and southern divisions of Scotland, these newer groups of rocks have not been detected. In this division of Scotland very few metallic ores have been found. Lead mines were formerly wrought at Tyn-drum, to the west of Loch Tay. Lead mines are at present wrought at Stronbean in Argyleshire, at which place the carbonate of strontian was first discovered. At Glen Strath-fairer, in Inverness-shire, there have been detected veins of plumbago running between the laminae of the mica slate.

We may here briefly refer to the geological character of the Western Isles. Dr. M'Culloch^[11. Western Islands of Scotland, VoL II.] calls the Long Island, consisting of a series of islands lying in a south-west and north-east direction, the gneiss island, from the predominance of that species of rock. Another group, embracing Skye, Rum, Canna, Mack, Egg, and Mull, he denominates the trap islands. There are five basaltic islands off the north-west side of Mull, of which the smallest but the most celebrated is Staffa, which is well known for its basaltic columns and cavern, called Fingal’s cave. This cave, one of the most remarkable natural excavations in the world, is formed of the columnar bed of basalt, where it declines to the level of the sea, which washes the feet of the columns, that are like the pillars of an immense cathedral, placed close to each other, the sea forming the floor. The top of the arch, at the entrance, is 66 feet; but it gradually declines to 40 at the extremity, at the distance of 227 feet. The breadth of the cave is about forty feet. There are other similar caverns of less note on the island. The basalt of which the columns in Staffa are composed, is similar to that of the Giant’s Causeway in Ireland; and it is probable that they are both of submarine origin, having been raised by the sea. St. Kilda,the most western of the Hebrides, is composed of several varieties of the trap rock. Arran, in the Firth of Clyde, even to the top of the highest mountains, is principally granitic.

In tracing the geological features of the country in the ascending order of the groups, we come next to the transition or greywacke system, now divided into two principal sections, the lower or Cumbrian, and the upper or Silurian. As far as has hitherto been ascertained, the Silurian division is unknown in Scotland; and the Cumbrian rocks, destitute of organic remains, cover the greater part of the area of the south of Scotland. These greywacke strata stand at high angles of from sixty to ninety degrees, and consist chiefly of coarse slatystrata, seldom divisible into thin roofing slates, and often alternating with arenaceous and coarse conglomerates. Amongst them, limestone is seldom found, and, when it is, the quality of it is inferior. In the division of which we now treat, coal and its accompaniments are known in few places; it is, however, wrought at Canonby, near Langholm, and at the Carter Fell. The only other rock formation, found in connexion with the old transition group here, with the exception of igneous rocks, is a red sandstone, ascertained, in some situations, to be the old red, but in others, considered as the new red sandstone, particularly in Dumfries-shire.

In the third geological division of Scotland, namely, the centre of the kingdom, is placed the great coal basin; but, adhering to our rule of marking the successive formations in the ascending order, we shall first treat of the old red sandstone, the most ancient rock in this subdivision of the country. This rock abuts against the line of the primary rocks, and stretches across the whole country from the German Ocean to the Atlantic, pursuing, like the mountain ranges, a south-westerly, or north-easterly direction. Its line forms a long, uninterrupted, extensive, and fertile valley. In the north-western part, it rises into hills, on the sides of one of which, east of Menteith, are deep and hideous fissures, the effect of some convulsion of the earth.

The formation appears to be of vast thickness, especially towards the north, and may, it is supposed, be divided into three portions; the lower, the middle, and the upper beds. In what are considered as the lower strata, the remains of fishes have been found in a high state of preservation. The well known Arbroath pavement belongs to the old red sandstone series.

But the most important group in this central district is the coal formation, consisting of limestone, ironstone, freestone, coal, and clays. The extent from east to west is bounded only by the extremities of the land. To the north, it is cut off from the old red sandstone by a range of trap hills, crossing the country from east to west. On the south, it is bounded by the greywacke and the old red sandstone. Its breadth, extending on both sides of the Forth and Clyde, averages forty miles, and its length about seventy miles.

The mountain limestone forms generally the basis of the group, although it is frequently found interstratified with other members of the series, and abounds with great numbers of organic remains. Below the mountain limestone, however, but belonging to the same group, a bed of limestone is worked at Burdie-house, near Edinburgh, in which the organic remains differ essentially from those which have been just named. These remains consist of many of the plants which distinguish the coal formation; but that alluded to includes also the teeth, scales, and other bones of fishes which partake of the reptile character, some of which must have been of gigantic dimensions. Small fishes are also found in a fine state of preservation. The same limestone has been found in other parts of the country, and is of superior quality to the common limestone, for mortar, plaster, and the smelting of iron.

The clay limestone is found in beds and nodules, the workable kind containing from twenty-seven to forty-five per cent. of iron. The kind termed black band is in high request. From this ore is smelted vast quantities of pig iron. The iron works in Scotland have been increasing beyond all example; at Carron, Gartsherrie, Shotts, Cleland, Airdrie, Clyde, and other places. The quantity of iron produced in Scotland in 1830 amounted to 37,500 tons. But tour years afterwards, in 1834, the latest date of which we have any correct accounst, the quantity had nearly doubled, being about 72,000 tons. These works are generally within ten or a dozen miles of Glasgow.

The coal is found in beds varying from a few inches to forty feet in thickness, is extracted in great quantity, and is used as fuel, both for domestic and manufacturing purposes. One variety, cannel coal, is of superior quality for[7:19:750] the preparation of gas. From the fire clay are manufactured fire brick and gas retorts; and the sandstone furnishes an inexhaustible store of substantial and beautiful material for building.

These several deposits contain in abundance the impressions of the vegetables which distinguish the carboniferous period; and, what is remarkable, the remains of animals, the same as occur in the Burdie-house limestone, are found in the shales, and even in the coal itself. In the island, no strata newer than the carboniferous system is known to exist. All is covered over with accumulations of clay, gravel, sand, and soil.

Until after the middle of last century’ there was scarcely a good road in Scotland. Soon after the rebellion of 1715, Government began to open up the country by roads made by the military, hence called military roads, which extended in all about eight hundred miles; but these being confined for the most part to the Highlands, intended for military purposes, and formed with little or no regard to such ascents and descents as do not impede the passage of an army, were of little advantage in an economical point of view. It is in the recollection of persons still living, when corn, coals, and other heavy articles, were usually carried upon the backs of horses, even in the southern counties of Scotland; the roads, or rather the tracks, being for the greater part of the year unfit for wheel-carriages. But so great a change has been made in this respect, particularly within the last forty years, that mail-coaches, and other carriages, now run day and night at the rate of from eight to ten miles an hour through every part of the country, from the borders of England to the northern extremity of Great Britain.

The only funds formerly applicable to the making and the repairing of the roads in Scotland were what is called the Statute Labour, or the labour of the occupiers of the land, for six days annually, upon the roads passing through their respective parishes, and a small assessment imposed upon the proprietors. This labbur, which has been converted into payment in money, and also the sums raised by assessment on the proprietors, under the name of road and bridge money, are now applied to bye-roads, or such as communicate with the great turnpikes. Almost every county has procured an act of Parliament which fixes the rate of these assessments; but this varies in different counties according to circumstances.

The turnpike roads and bridges in the Lowlands have, for nearly a century, been made, and are kept in repair by means of tolls exacted from those who use them, under the authority of private acts of Parliament. The first of these acts was obtained in 1750, at which time the roads were so bad that the journey from Edinburgh to Glasgow, a distance of forty-two miles, occupied 1 1 / 2 days, whereas it is now effected in from 4 ½ to 5 hours. The trustees named in these acts are commonly empowered, whether wisely or not, to borrow money upon the security of the funds to be received; by which means the work is more speedily executed. The board of trustees consists of the sheriff-depute, his substitute, and the justices of the peace in the county, together with all individuals, and their eldest sons, who are owners of estates worth L.100 Scotch a-year, and upwards, of valued rent. The result of this is, that “in consequence of the excellent materials which abound in all parts of Scotland, and of the greater skill and science of Scotch trustees and surveyors, the turnpike roads in Scotland are superior to those in England.”^[12. Sir H. Parnell's Treatise on Ronds, p. 313.]

In the Highlands, the nature of the country, and the state of the population, did not admit of the same system as in the Lowlands. The military roads had not only been made, but were kept in repair at the public expense, for which L.5000 a-year was usually granted by Parliament; but a great many new roads and bridges were required; and, in 1803, an act was passed, proceeding upon “a survey and report of the coasts and central Highlands of Scotland,” by which Parliament agreed to provide half the estimated expense of the necessary roads and bridges, the other half to be defrayed by the landed proprietors; and Commissioners were named to carry into effect the beneficent intentions of the Legislature. It appears from the report just referred to, that, under this act, the Commissioners had, in 1821, expended, on 875 miles of road, and several large bridges, upwards of L.450,000, of which L.240,000 was granted by Parliament, and the rest defrayed by the counties through which the roads passed; and that L.100,000 more had been laid out by them upon harbours, of which L.50,000 was paid out of the funds arising from the forfeited estates in Scotland, and the remainder raised by the burghs, and by the contributions of individuals. If, to these sums, we add the amount of the losses sustained by the contractors, as stated in the Report, and the expense of the new roads made at the sole cost of the proprietors, to communicate with the Parliamentary roads, together with the charges of repairs, the whole amount expended within these twenty years upon the roads, bridges, and harbours of the Highlands of Scotland, may not be too highly stated at a million sterling. The Commissioners have under their charge both the maintaining of their own roads, and part of the military roads, the extent of the whole in 1821 being 1183 miles; and about L.10,000 a-year, of which L.5000 is granted by Parliament, was considered to be necessary for this purpose, including all charges of management.^[13. Anderson’s Guide to the Highlands, &c. p. 6. Ninth Report of the Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges.] The military roads have been in many instances allowed to fall into disrepair; but nearly three hundred miles of them are still kept up.

The Caledonian Canal, the greatest work of the kind ever attempted in Great Britain, stretches south-west and northeast across the island, from a point near Inverness to Fort-William, a distance of 60 ½ miles, including Lochs Ness, Oich, and Lochy, by which nearly two-thirds of it are formed. The excavated or artificial part is tw enty-three miles; and there are in all twenty locks. The depth in some places is only seventeen feet, but it was originally meant to be twenty. As it is, however, frigates of 32 guns, and merchant ships of 1000 tons can pass through it. It is 50 feet wide at the bottom, and 122 at top. But with all its magnificence, it has been found to be an improvident speculation. The total cost of the canal, up to 1822, when it was opened, was L.905,258; and the aggregate outlay to the first of May 1839, was no less than L.1,023,628. Besides, the Commissioners have incurred a debt, including cash advanced by the bank, and outstanding claims, of L.39,146. Nor has the income ever met the expenditure. In the year ending on the first of May 1839, for example, the expenditure was L.4170, whereas the income, though above the average, was only L.2532. It has, therefore, become a question with government whether the undertaking should be maintained or abandoned. The Lords of the Treasury, accordingly, em-[7:19:751] ployed Mr. James Walker, engineer, to institute a minute investigation of the entire works, and to report. The report was presented to the House of Commons in 1838; and a select Committee was appointed to take the whole subject into consideration. The result of their investigations was, a recommendation that steam tugs should be employed in the locks, so as to ensure a speedy navigation, and that a sum not exceeding L.200,000 be placed at the disposal of the government, to be expended in the repair and improvement of the canal, under the authority of an act of Parliament, which should be procured for the purpose.^[15. See Thirty fourth Report of the Canal Commission, Mr. Walker’s Report, and Report of Secret Committee.] ’ This recommendation will, it is hoped, be acted upon. (Navigation, Inland ). The Crinan canal is situated in Argyleshire, and is intended to afford a communication between Loch Gi!p and the Western Ocean, so as to avoid the difficult and circuitous passage round the Mull of Cantyre. It was originally undertaken in 1793 by subscription of share-holders; but the sum subscribed(L.108,000) being quite insufficient for the completion of the work, the government advanced the money, and the canal was transferred on mortgage to the Barons of Exchequer in Scotland. The management has since 1817 been lodged in the hands of the Commissioners of the Caledonian Canal. It is nine miles long, and twelve feet deep, admitting vessels of 200 tons burden. The income scarcely covers the expenditure.^[16. Ibid.] The Forth and Clyde Canal, sometimes called the Great Canal, though begun in 1768, was not finally completed till 1790. The length from Grangemouth on the Forth to Bowling Bay on the Clyde, is 35 miles, and, including the lateral branch to Port-Dundas, Glasgow, 38 ½. Its depth is ten feet; and it has in all thirty-nine locks. Though iron swift boats and other lighters ply upon it, its staple trade consists in the transit of sailing vessels of 120 tons and under. The Edinburgh and Glasgow Union Canal, which was finished in 1822, stretches from Port-Hopetoun, Edinburgh, until it joins the Forth and Clyde Canal at Port-Downie, near Falkirk, a distance of 31 ½ miles. Its depth is only five feet, so that its traffic is quite limited. The Monkland Canal stretches from Glasgow to Woodhall, about two miles south-east of Airdrie, a distance of twelve miles, and communicates by a lateral branch with the Forth and Clyde Canal at Port-Dundas. The Glasgow, Paisley, and Ardrossan Canal has not been completed; indeed it is not now intended to complete it. The progress of railways seems partially to supersede the use of canal communication. The canal in question has been constructed from Port-Eglinton, near Glasgow, to the village of Johnstone, a distance of eleven miles, and was opened in 1811. It was on this canal that the experiment was made in rapid travelling by canals, demonstrating that it was practicable for a properly constructed boat, carrying passengers and goods along a canal, to go at a rate of nine or ten miles an hour, without injury to the banks. These light boats are now common on canals suited for such travelling. The Aberdeenshire Canal, completed in 1807, stretches from the harbour of Aberdeen to Inventury. The length is 18 1 / 4 miles, and the number of locks is seventeen.

The first act obtained, in 1808, for a railway in Scotland, was for that between Kilmarnock and Troon, a distance of 9 1 / 2 miles. The Monkland and Kirkintilloch railway connects the rich coal and ironstone district of New and Old Monkland, and, within fourteen miles of the city of Glasgow, with the Forth and Clyde Canal, near Kirkintilloch. The Ballochney railway, which has been in operation for about ten years, is merely an elongation of the last mentioned line, four miles eastward into the interior. The Glasgow and Garnkirk railway stretches eight miles west from Glasgow, till it communicates with the Monkland and Kirkintilloch line, forming a direct communication with Glasgow, and avoiding the circuitous route of that line. The Wishaw and Coltness railway, which is meant to connect the Monkland and Kirkintilloch branch with the rich coal and ironstone beds of Wishaw, Coltness, and Allanton, has not yet been completed, though the act was passed in 1829. The Slamannan railway, which is in progress of construction, is to extend from the eastern termination of the Ballochney line to the Union Canal, within a mile of Linlithgow, a distance of 12 1 / 2 miles. An act has been passed (1837) for forming a branch to the town of Bathgate. The Pollock and Govan railway, which was meant to connect these two places, which lye on the south of Glasgow, with that city, an interval of three miles, is in the same unfinished state. The Paisley and Renfrew railway, which extends from Paisley to the river Clyde at Renfrew ferry, a distance of 3 ½ miles, was opened in 1837. The Glasgow, Paisley, and Greenock railway is meant to connect Glasgow and Greenock by way of Paisley. It runs nearly parallel with the Clyde, and is meant to be completed in 1840. The Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock, and Ayr railway is intended to connect these towns and the adjacent districts. The line from Glasgow to Paisley is declared to be common to the latter line, and that of the Glasgow, Paisley, and Greenock railway, and to be executed at the joint expense of both companies. The Glasgow and Paisley railway is to send branches out to the different towns in the district through which it passes. An act was obtained in 1838 for constructing a railway between Edinburgh and Glasgow. The line is to run nearly on a parallel with the Union Canal, past Ratho, Winchburgh, Linlithgow, and Falkirk, to pass that canal near Port-Downie, and to proceed onward to Glasgow by a line nearly parallel to the Great Canal. The distance will be forty-six miles. The capital of the company is L.900,000. Twenty-nine miles of the line have already been contracted for, and the work will be completed at farthest in 1842. The Edinburgh and Dalkeith railway was opened in 1832. It extends to Dalhousie Mains on the South Esk, but a private branch has been carried over that river by a viaduct, and extends southwards for upwards of a mile. The Dalkeith line is about to be carried over the North Esk, in order to connect extensive coal fields in that quarter with the city of Edinburgh. There are also branches to Leith and Fisherrow. On this railway upwards of 100,000 tons of goods, and 300,000 passengers are annually conveyed. The Edinburgh, Leith, and Newhaven railway is only meant to extend 2 1 / 2 miles. It is to commence at Canal Street, at the cast end of Princes Street gardens, and proceed by a tunnel of 2800 feet, or rather more than a fifth of the whole line, under St. Andrews Street, St. Andrews Square, Duke Street, Drummond Place, &c. to the foot of Scotland Street, and thence to Newhaven in nearly a straight line, with a branch along the north side of the Water of Leith, to the wet docks at Leith. The work has been begun, but when it will be completed is uncertain. If the terminus of the line were to be united with that of the Edinburgh and Glasgow railway, much advantage would accrue to both speculations. But, according to act of Parliament, a mile intervenes at present between the dépôts of the two. The Dundee and Newtyle railway is eleven miles in length, but branches are in progress to Cupar-Angus and to Glammis. There are on the line three inclined planes, and a tunnel of 340 yards. The Dundee and Forfar railway was opened in

1838. Its length is 16 ¾ miles. The Arbroath and Forfar railway is just completed. The distance is 15 ¼ miles.

About the middle of the seventeenth century, the lands of Scotland were valued, with a view to ascertain what proportion of the land-tax and others should be paid by each county; and this valuation, called the “valued rent,” which had been undertaken by the authority of Cromwell, was afterwards[7:19:752] established by an act of the Scottish Convention in 1667.^[17. Burton's Manual of the Law of Scotland, p. 120.] l It is still the standard by which the counties, and the estates of each county, are assessed for payment of the land tax,^[18. By the Union, the land tax was limited to L.48,000, deducting all expenses. In 1797, it was limited to L.47,954, 1s. 2d., and made perpetual, but liable to be redeemed by the proprietor, for stock in the three per cents. equal in annual value to one tenth more than the tax.] * and all local imposts on land. The “valued rent” of the whole Scottish counties, as it stood in 1674, was L.3,804,221 Scots, or L.3l7,018, 8s. 4d. sterling. In 1811, the landed property of Scotland was subdivided as in the following proportions,^[19. ’ General Report of Scotland, iii. appendix, p. 4.] and there is every reason to believe that the document is not very far from the truth at the present time:

Description of the Estates. Proprietors.

Large properties, or estates above L.2000 of valued rental, 396

Middling properties or estates from L.2000 to

L.500 of valued rental, 1077

Small properties, or estates under L.500 of valued rental 6181

Estates belonging to corporate bodies, 144

Total, 7798

The total extent of land in Scotland, exclusive of lakes, is 18,944,000 acres, but of this quantity only a fourth part, or 5,043,450 acres, are susceptible of cultivation.^[20. The least proportion of cultivated land is in the counties of Selkirk, Sutherland, and Orkney, being only about six acres in the hundred; the greatest is in the county of Haddington, or East Lothian, where not quite a fourth remains uncultivated.] But even of this small proportion, nearly a half, or 2,489,725 acres, are estimated to be in grass. The following table^[21. • Statistical Account of British Empire, i. p. 537.] will shew the distribution of the land in tillage, with the quantity and value of the crops:

Such are the average quantity and value of the lands actually in tillage. But the average value per acre of the arable soils in pasture is estimated in the General Report at L.2; and on this hypothesis, the produce of 2,489,725 acres of pasture, will be L.4,979,450. But there still remains 14,000,000 acres of mountain pasture, waste land, and plantations,^[22. The total extent of woodland was estimated in the General Report of Scotland (ii. p. 321,) at 913,695 acres, of which 501,469 were natural woods, and 412,226 plantations. the quantity of the latter has since increased, so that the total of woodland cannot be less than 950,000 acres.] which, at an average rent of 3s. per acre, will be L.2,100,000. Hence the total annual value of the land produce in Scotland will be,

... pasture land 4,979,450

... mountain pasture land, &c 2,100,000

Total,.... L.20,435,325

This is the value of the gross produce of the soil. Most of the land is rented by tenants, only about a tenth part being supposed to be farmed by the landowners. The exact amount of the rental of Scotland cannot be known. The rental for 1810, including mines, fisheries, quarries, and the like,^[23. ’ General Report, i. p. 123.] was ascertained to be L.4,851,404; and it is supposed that, though considerable variations have taken place in different districts, the rental of Scotland continues at nearly the same amount; for although many of the rents contracted for, during the last years of the late war, have been greatly reduced, yet others, from the falling in of the older leases, have been proportionally advanced. As the common duration of the lease in Scotland is 19 years, the average term of the current leases must be between 9 and 10 years; so that half the leases current in the beginning of 1810 must have been entered into in the first year of the century, at a period previous to any great enhancement of land having taken place. Hence it is that we regard the rental of 1810 and of the present time as nearly equal to each other. It is conjectured by an eminent authority, that the rental of the 14,000,000 acres of mountain pasture, including wood and waste lands, does not exceed L.850,000, or, in other words, that it averages 1 1 / 7 s. per acre, whilst he estimates the rental of the arable portion at an average of 16s. an acre.^[24. Statistical Account of the British Empire, p. 539.] Rent, we may here remark, has advanced more in Scotland during the last seventy years, than perhaps in any old settled country during a similar period. The entire rental of Scotland is not supposed to have exceeded L.l,000,000, or L.1,200,000, in 1770. In 1795, it is believed to have been at least L.2,000,000; and since that time it has a good deal more than doubled.

It is here worthy of remark, that both the law and the practice of Scotland are favourable to agricultural enterprise. What in England are termed “tenants at will,” or tenants without a lease, are unknown in this portion of the empire. Leases in Scotland may be said to be universal, extending to 15, 19, or 21 years. It was not uncommon, indeed, about fifty years ago, and before that time, to give liferents, or leases for twice nineteen years, or even longer, a circumstance highly favourable to enterprise on the part of the tenant. With the exception of some districts in the Highlands and Islands, the system of small farms has been abandoned, and has given way to farms of great extent, rented by persons of intelligence and capital. There are no tithes. Poor-rates are entirely unknown in about three-fourths of the parishes of Scotland; and where this assessment does exist, it is of comparatively trifling amount. Besides, so large are the farms, that, exclusive of owners who cultivate their own property or portions of it, there are supposed to be only about 40,000 tenants in Scotland. And as farms are large, so they cannot be divided or sublet without the consent of the landlord. This consent is seldom or never granted; so that in point of fact no such subdivision ever takes place. A lease, moreover, is heritable; and on the death of a tenant, it is not parcelled out amongst his children, but descends entire to his oldest son, or heir at law. All these circumstances combined afford great encouragement to agricultural improvement and enterprise.[7:19:753] Table, shewing the extent of Land (exclusive of Lakes), in the several counties of Scotland in imperial stature acres, the extent of cultivated and uncultivated acres in each; the total rental of the land, including mines, fisheries, &c~, in 1810, according to the returns under the Property Tax Act; the rent per acre in the same year; and the valued rent in Scotch money.

Judicial Establishments of Scotland.

In a remote, and what may be termed the aboriginal period of our judicial annals, the king was chief justice of the kingdom; and, with his council., made progress through the realm for the administration of public justice. At that time, indeed, the king executed in person the principal duties of government; and it was not till comparatively recent times that the different departments of the state began to be exclusively assigned to distinct and responsible officers.

As late as the middle of the fifteenth century, an act was passed, in which “the three estates concluded, that our sovereign lord ride through the realm incontinent, after there be word sent to his council., where any rebellion, slaughter, huming, reif, or thieft happens; and there to call the sheriff of the shire, and ere the king depart out of that shire, to set remeid of the harm, or gif ony sik sall happen to be done, whether the default be in the officers or in the doers, to be punished by the king; the quhilk conclusion and ordinance, all the barons of common assent and consent are obliged to assist baith with their power in bodies and gudes.” This act was passed in the third parliament of king James the Second; and in the fifth parliament of his successor, when the courts of justice were regulated by statute, there was a special proviso to the effect that, “nevertheless, it sall be lawful to the kingis highness to take decision of ony matter that comes before him, at his compleasance, like as it was wont to be of before,” 1469, c. 26. Two centuries afterwards, Charles the Second claimed a like power and prerogative; and “in a dutiful and humble recognisance thereof,” the estates of parliament declared, that notwithstanding of any jurisdictions or offices whatsoever, “his sacred majesty may, by himself or any commissionated by him, take cognisance and decision of any cases or causes he pleases,” all government and jurisdiction within the kingdom originally residing in him, 1681, c. 18. Such a right, however, formed one of the grievances complained of at the Revolution; and since that event it has been deemed a settled part of the constitutional law of the land, that the king has committed all judicial power to the judges, and cannot himself administer justice in the courts.

The justiciar (justiciarius) was anciently the king’s more,[7:19:754] immediate and principal officer. He seems to have been 'derived from Normandy; and agreeably to the mixed constitution of that country, he was here, as in England, caput legis et militioe, at the head both of the law and of the military force of the kingdom. He accompanied the king in his progresses through the realm, or represented him in his absence; and he had thus powers and jurisdiction as universal in their nature as they were unlimited in extent. We find, accordingly, repeated instances of the military prowess as well as judicial firmness of our early justiciars; and, not to mention other instances, in the middle of the thirteenth century, Durward, when thwarted in the project he had conceived of securing the throne to his descendants, joined Henry the Third in France, and served in his army, till, by the influence of the English monarch, he was re-instated in his high office of lord justiciar.

It does not appear, however, that the justiciar ever became here the formidable officer which he proved to be in England, where he was at one time a terror both to the king and to his subjects. Various circumstances concurred to limit his power. The chief of these, no doubt, was the influence of his adversary, the Lord Chancellor, as the head and organ of the ecclesiastics; but much also was owing to the early partition of the office into a justiciary of ancient Scotland, or the territory north of the Forth, and of Lothian, or the territory south of the Forth. This partition of the office, indeed, is observed in the very earliest notice of our justiciars. The series begins in the reign of Malcolm the Fourth, and from that time we have distinct and separate justiciars for Scotland and for Lothian. In neither of these was Galloway comprehended, that district enjoying its own peculiar laws and customs;^[25. Stat. Alex. II. c. § 1. fin.] but in 1258 it also got a separate justiciar. This state of matters continued till the invasion of Scotland by Edward the First.

In 1296, Sir William de Ormesby, a justice of the common pleas, and justice in ayre in England, was constituted lord justiciar of Scotland by Edward, who also associated with him William de Mortimer, an English justice of assize; and the next year the same king made Roger de Skotre, an English lawyer, justiciar of Galloway. But ip 1299, John earl of Buchan was justiciarius Scotioe; he was son of the last regular justiciar of Scotland, Alexander earl of Buchan, who was upwards of thirty years in office previous to his death in the year 1289. In 1305, however, Edward again put down the Scotch; and thereupon distributed the kingdom into four districts, appointing for each district two justices, an Englishman and a Scotchman. These officers were of the nature of the English justices of assize; and when we take into consideration the nature of the appointments which were at the same time made in the counties, the object in view cannot be mistaken. Edward evidently contemplated putting the whole island under one judicial system, which had shortly before been introduced into England, namely, that of having annual or temporary sheriffs with a limited jurisdiction, and confining the law business of the country to a few courts and judges; a system very different from that which previously existed both in England and Scotland, where the great object was to bring justice home to every man’s door in permanent local courts. The project, however, was stopped by Edward’s death; the justiciars of Scotland and Lothian were then displaced, and permanent sheriffs restored. Robert the Second also restored to the people of Galloway their ancient laws.^[26. Rob. I. c. 35.] Matters appear to have generally continued in this state till the disastrous battle of Flodden. On that event, which united all classes of the community, the office of lord justiciar, or, as he was now styled, lord justice general, (in contradistinction to the special justiciars now frequently appointed, as well for particular trials as for particular places and districts,) came into the hands of a single individual, and comprehended the whole kingdom. The High Court of Justiciary also began to be settled at Edinburgh, and from that time commence the regular series of its books of adjournal.

The Justiciar or Justice-General might now have become formidable; but circumstances again concurred to reduce his power. The office fell into the noble family of Argyll, where it continued hereditary for a century; the Court of Session was established with a universal civil jurisdiction; and as that court was co-ordinate with it on the land, the admiral of Scotland came to be co-ordinate with it on the seas. By statute 1587, c.82, eight senators or advocates of the College of Justice, were appointed as justiciar-deputes for the different quarters into which the realm was then divided; and by 1672, c. 16, instead of the justice-deputes, five lords of session were constituted commissioners of justiciary, along withthelord justice-general,and the justice-clerk, which latter was now made vice-president of the court. By statute 1681, c. 16, too, the high admiral was declared the king’s lieutenant and justice-general on the seas. By a recent act, however, the Court of Justiciary re-acquired a jurisdiction in crimes at sea; and by Will. IV. c. 69, which entirely abolished the court of admiralty, the office of lord justice-general was made to devolve on, and remain with that of lord-president of the Court of Session. The effect of this seems to have been to place the justice-general at the head of the administration of the law; and thus, by a singular revolution, to restore him, after the lapse of three hundred years, to his former situation as lord chief-justice of Scotland.

It may, in conclusion, be remarked here, that in the Court of Justiciary, which, being a superior or at least co-ordinate tribunal, was but indirectly affected by the changes in the law introduced by the Court of Session, several usages of our most ancient common law have been preserved to this day. The court meets about eleven o’clock, which was the hour of cause of old, (1587, c. 87) whereas the Court of Session, in direct contrast, rose at that time, meeting, agreeably to the early hours of the ecclesiastics, at eight in the morning, (1537, c. 49). So also, jury trial, when laid aside by the other courts, continued here; the verdict is still by a majority; and in the assizes oath, we may trace at once the original character of a jury as an inquest of the vicinage, and also the rhythmical measures of our old legal formulae. The circuits of the Court of Justiciary were arranged in their present form by the act 1587, c. 82. Previous to that time the justiciar made a progress through the realm, from shire to shire, successively; but, by the above act, the realm was divided into four districts, or quarters. The present circuits are, besides the Lothians or home circuit, the southern, western, and northern circuits. The assize towns of the south, are Jedburgh, Dumfries, and Ayr; those of the west, Glasgow, Inverary, and Stirling; those of the north, Perth, Aberdeen, and Inverness.

The Court of Session, that is to say, the first court so called, was erected in 1425, the year following King James the First’s return from his long captivity in England. It was composed of the “chancellor, and with him certain discreet persons of the three estates, chosen and depute by the king and was to have a like jurisdiction as that exercised by the king and his council. It was, however, but of short duration; for, on the king’s death, or rather on that of Bishop Wardlaw of St. Andrews, by whose influence it was in all likelihood erected, Bishop Cameron, the chancellor, was removed from office, and the court of the session expired. Attempts were afterwards made to revive it by Bishop Horse-wood, secretary to king James II.; and, thirty years afterwards, by Bishop Elphinstone, whose zeal for the establishment of[7:19:755] the Roman law is well known. Accordingly in 1503, the court of daily council., which was essentially a revival of the former court of the session, was established by means of Bishop Elphinstone. And at length, whilst the kingdom was yet in a state of distraction from the fatal losses at Flodden, the present Court of Session or College of Justice was instituted; and of the numerous attempts of the clergy to establish the Roman law as the common law of the land, this was the last and most successful.

According to the simple principles of our old law, all suits originated by plaint, claim, or summary application to the judge, setting forth the cause of action; and the judge was bound of common right to administer justice therein. But afterwards, a maxim was introduced that the judges were substitutes of the crown, and consequently should take cognisance only of what was specially referred to them. Brieves or mandatory letters from the king to the judges were then invented; and the chancel of the royal chapel became the great officina justitiae, the shop or mint where the king’s writs were framed, and sold out to parties injured, according to the exigency of the case. These writs issued out from the chancel or chancery until the institution of the College of Justice, when the chancellor and clergy, who were the principal judges there, began a mint or shop of their own in the Bill chamber of the court, so called because the brieves, or, as they are here termed letters, issue out, not on the oral application of the party, but on his “bill” or written supplication. This course of proceeding was adopted from the court of Rome; and it is observable, that in both cases the language employed is sometimes identical. Thus, when the request or prayer of the bill is granted, the judgment is, Fiat ut petitur, which are the very words used by the Pope in the like case; and tire odd phrase, “Finds the letters orderly proceeded,” is but a verbal translation of the Male appellatum et bene processum of the papal court. The names of the letters are also the same, letters of advocation ion, suspension, and reduction, being equally well known in both places; and letters of horning, caption, and relaxation, have their papal origin impressed upon them. The comparison might be carried through our whole process to its minutest technicality, and also to the style and habit of the judges. After the manner of the ecclesiastical tribunals, too, the judges deliberated in secret conclave with shut doors, parties and their counsel, and all others being removed (1537, c. 66); and there was no report of the judges’ opinions, or of the reasons of the judgment, but only of the vote or sentence. At the Revolution, however, the court was thrown open; but so powerful is custom over all men, that to this day the great body of the practitioners continue to walk the Outer House.

In modem times the court has been altered in almost every particular; its constitution and jurisdiction, the number of the judges, the distribution of the business, and the forms of proceeding. The machinery was indeed bad, but the spirit which pervaded it was worse; and the best antidote to this would perhaps be the full force of public opinion, that is, perfect publicity, not merely of hearing and judgment, but of every step in the administration of justice.

According to its first institution, the court consisted of a president and fourteen ordinary lords, half of the temporal estate and half spiritual, of which the president likewise was one. The Lord Chancellor, who was also an ecclesiastic, was made principal of the college, as it was termed, and as such had a vote with the judges; and there was a reserved power to the king to appoint, at his pleasure, three or four extraordinary lords, a power which the crown always exercised, and also sometimes greatly abused. It was the Reformation which gave the first blow to the court. From that event it began to lose its ecclesiastical, which had been its earliest and most distinguishing feature. The Revolution followed, and opened up to the public eye the heretofore secret tribunal. And at the union with England it ceased to be supreme, though this last peculiarity, and that by which the Lords became so formidable in the country, was long struggled for, and is yet perhaps but imperfectly given up by the court. These important changes, however, affected the spirit and character of the court, rather than its external form, which remained much as it was before. But they prepared the way for alterations there too; and during the last thirty years, a great number of public statutes have been passed, altering the details of the court, and otherwise regulating the administration of justice throughout the kingdom.

In 1808, the commencement of the period just referred to, the court was formed into two divisions; or, in effect, two communicating but equal and independent courts. The reason assigned for this change, was the greatly increased number of lawsuits from the great extension of agriculture, commerce, manufactures, and population, and the consequent multiplication of transactions in Scotland. There is every ground to believe, however, that much of the supposed business was caused by the tedious methods of proof and written pleadings adopted by the court, and its endless judgments and rehearings; for in the degree in which these have been abolished, the court has been able to absorb and dispatch the business of the other superior courts, and still to allow a decrease in the number of its judges. These are now only thirteen in all. Each division is composed of four judges; the Lord President, who is properly head of the whole court, presiding in the First Division, and the Lord Justice-Clerk presiding in the Second. The remaining judges sit separately in the Outer House, as Lords Ordinary. This term was originally given to all the judges under the president, and they served in the Outer House by rotation; but amongst other recent changes, the five junior judges were at first made permanent Lords Ordinary, as attached to a particular division of the Inner House, but now without any such relation. The junior or youngest Lord Ordinary of all is Ordinary on the Bills, and has a peculiar class of cases assigned to him. But it is to be observed, that from him, and from the other Ordinaries, an appeal lies, or a proceeding in the nature of an appeal, to the Inner House; which, besides this appellate, has also some original jurisdiction. It is not necessary to add, that there is much imperfection in this whole system of judicature. There appears to have been little unity of design in its formation; there is considerable complexity in its actual working, and there is no great satisfaction in its results.^[27. In the year 1800, the number of causes enrolled in the Outer House, was 2413; in 1810, it was 2643; in 1820, it was 2069; and in 1831, it was 1056. In the years 1836 and 1837, the business stood thus :— [table]]

Let us now turn our attention to the local courts throughout the kingdom.

In early times the realm was divided into provinces, clanships, or counties, in each of which was a maormor, maor, mayor or mair, as the king’s executive and ministerial officer; and in every county or province there were divers judges, each exercising judicial functions. The provinces and judicial districts of those times, however, are now but imperfectly known; and, as might be expected, the series of mayors and judges cannot by any means be made out. With re-[7:19:756] spect to the latter, viz., the Celtic judge, we have not traced him to a later period than the beginning of the fourteenth century. He was in all probability extinguished during king Edward’s invasion of Scotland in the unhappy times which followed on the death of king Alexander the Third. The sheriff was then universally established; and as that officer engrossed to himself the functions both of the judge and mair, the former disappeared entirely from our annals, whilst the latter gradually degenerated into the sheriff's officer, with whom, accordingly, he is, to the present day, found mixed up in some of the northern counties.

The most ancient sheriff was certainly the comes or earl. There is no direct evidence to that effect, however; and from a remote time, the officer so called was the vice-cornes. The office was not a century in existence amongst us, when, falling into the hands of the great local proprietors, it began to descend to heirs with the paternal estate. The sheriffship of Ayr, which was erected in the year 1221, out of the bailiaries of Kyle, Carrick, and Cuningham, was from the first hereditary. It is not surprising that the hereditary vice-cornes should soon cense to perform in person the duties of his office; these were accordingly devolved on a deputy or sub-vice-comes. The earliest officer of this sort we have met with, is Alan de Pilch, or Alan of the hairy garment, sub-vice-comes de Inverness, temp. Robert I.;^[28. Robertson’s Index, p. 29.] but sheriff-deputes are mentioned much earlier,^[29. Stat. Will. c. 14. Stat. Alex. II. c. 14.] and to such an extent was the abuse of deputation carried, that in some counties, that of Cromarty for instance, the district was partitioned into various deputy-sheriffships, and individuals appointed, such as officers of the army, medical men, and others, in situations of life perfectly incompatible with the due discharge of the office. The office also in many instances became hereditary; and another was required to execute the active duties of the place, or pro-sub-vice-cornes. Thus, at the time of the jurisdiction act in 1747, there were in most or all of the counties, omitting the comes, count or earl, a sheriff-principal or high sheriff, and sheriff-depute, and a sheriff-substitute. All these were continued by the above act; but the judicial powers were confined to the two last, whose duties and qualifications have also been repeatedly regulated. It would undoubtedly have been more agreeable to principle, however, to have abolished offices which grew out of the abuses of the times, and assigned to every sheriff a reasonable district in respect of extent and population, with constant residence therein, and the exercise of judicial functions only. In determining the number, character, and situation of courts in a country, the great problem evidently is, so to distribute them as to secure two things, namely, to bring justice home to every man’s door, and to mature a sound and fixed system of jurisprudence. In England, the latter object appears to have been principally regarded since the days of Edward the First, before whose time England and Scotland were equally distinguished for their local courts. But what, we may ask, avails the best system of law, if it be remote or difficult of access? The end is in such case sacrificed to the means; and a multitude of petty courts, with a few practitioners in each, would prove the ruin not only of the legal profession, but of the law itself.

The sheriff-principal, or high sheriff, is lord lieutenant of his county, and appointed at pleasure by the crown. The sheriff-depute, so called, is also appointed by the crown; but he is quite independent of the high sheriff. He must be an advocate of at least three years’ standing; he holds his office during life, or good behaviour; and he receives a salary, varying, according to the shire, from L.350 to L.1200 a-year. The sheriff-substitute must be of the profession of the law, though not necessarily a member of the bar. He is named by the sheriff-depute of the shire, but paid by the crown, and is otherwise an independent officer. In every county there is a high sheriff or lord lieutenant. The same may be said of the sheriff-depute, except as to the united shires of Clackmannan and Kinross, Elgin and Nairn, Ross and Cromarty. Ross, Sutherland, and Caithness, were originally parts of the great shire of Inverness; but in the seventeenth century they became disjoined, and were erected into separate shires. By the jurisdiction act, however, Ross was put under the same sheriff with the ancient shire of Cromarty, and has continued so ever since. Sutherland and Caithness were then also re-united; but in 1806 these were again separated. Kinross was originally part of Fife; but it was afterwards separated, then re-united, and in 1807 disjoined again, and united to Clackmannan. With respect to the sheriff-substitute, in every shire there is at least one; but Edinburgh, Fife, Forfar, Perth, Renfrew, and Sutherland, have each two, Kirkcudbright and Argyle have each three, Lanark and Inverness have each four, and in one of the districts of Ross there is a sort of assistant substitute.

The jurisdiction of the county courts was originally most extensive; and as to civil suits in particular, there seems to have been scarcely any limitation. It was the policy of the Court of Session, however, to make itself the great law court of the kingdom; and as it gradually absorbed the civil jurisdiction of the justiciary, so, by a bold stratagem, it stripped the sheriff of all power to decide upon questions of real property. Such questions were formerly tried under the brieve of right, a judicial writ so named, because issued to try what was esteemed the highest right, that of property in land; and it is clear that this brieve was in viridi observantia, and competent to sheriffs, till within a very few years of the institution of the Court of Session. This is clear from the act 1503, c. 95, which was passed to regulate it; and it is familiarly referred to by the poet Dunbar, in his Dance of the Seven Deadly Sins, where, speaking of the occupations of the damned, he says,

Yet the Court of Session was scarcely established, when it boldly adjudged this brieve “nocht to have bene, nor yet to be thir mony yeires in use ;”^[30. Skene voce Breve de recto.] and having thus, by repressing the writ, ousted the sheriff of his real jurisdiction, Boon took it to itself exclusively,^[31. Bishop of Aberdeen v . Ogilvy, 3d July 1563.] by letters prepared for the court in its own Bill-chamber. The sheriff, however, still continued competent to possessory actions; and by a recent statute, his jurisdiction has even extended to all actions and proceedings relative to nuisance or damages, arising from an undue exercise of the right of property, and also to questions touching the constitution or exercise of real or judicial servitudes, which is so far a restoration of his ancient powers. Besides the ordinary jurisdiction, civil and criminal, of the county court, the sheriff is empowered to decide summarily in questions of debt, when the sum in dispute does not exceed eight pounds. These small debt courts were instituted in 1825, with a view to extend and improve the like jurisdiction, which had been conferred upon justices of the peace about thirty years before. The summary redress which such courts afford is of the greatest benefit to trade and to good neighbourhood, in consequence of the little sacrifice of time, money, and feeling they require; and they are accordingly now extensively established, not only in this[7:19:757] country, but in England. There can be no doubt, however, that they had their origin in Scotland.^[32. The following table, from official returns, of causes brought for the five years preceding 1882, will give an idea of the working of the ordinary civil courts of the sheriffs in some of the principal counties. [table] The following table, from official returns, will show the working of the small debt courts, and at the same time point out the preference given to the sheriff, or to the justices of the peace, in the counties named. Number of Small Debt Causes decided in the year 1832. [table]]

The courts we have now adverted to comprehend the public and general courts of the kingdom, which have a public and general jurisdiction; but besides these, there are, or rather were, some whose jurisdiction was limited to particular sorts of causes only. We allude to the Court of Exchequer, and the ecclesiastical and maritime courts.

With respect to the first of these, the old Scotch court, composed of the treasurer and lords auditors of exchequer, was superseded at the union by a Court of Exchequer, composed of a lord chief-baron and four puisne barons; and in addition to certain ministerial powers continued from the old court, it had the like authority, jurisdiction, and course of procedure as the Court of Exchequer in England, after which generally it was modelled. It was an absurdly large and expensive establishment. It had comparatively nothing to do; and as the judges might be, and some of them commonly were, English barristers, it never could be opened up, like the exchequer of England, to the ordinary law business of the country. Accordingly the barons were gradually reduced, and the business is now transacted by a lord of session sitting as a judge in exchequer.

The Commission of Teinds, which was first erected at the Reformation, was in like manner remodelled at the Union. It was formerly vested with powers for the planting of churches, assigning and modifying stipends, and the valuation and sale of teinds. But by a recent statute, all actions for the valuation or sale of teinds, all actions of suspension or reduction of localities, and all actions of declarator or reduction connected with teinds, must be brought and decided in the Court of Session.

In times of popery, causes ecclesiastical were tried by the archdeacon’s official, the bishop’s commissary, and the auditor or official principal of the province; from which last an appeal lay to the pope, who generally determined the matter by commission. But at the Reformation, commissaries named by tne crown were appointed in every commissariat; and a Commissary Court, with original and appellate jurisdiction, was also established at Edinburgh, of which Sir James Balfour, the former official of St. Andrews, within the archdeaconry of Lothian, was the first chief-judge. The commissary courts continued till recent times, when the office of the local commissaries was abolished, and soon afterwards the Commissary Court of Edinburgh, their powers and jurisdiction being transferred to the Court of

Session, and, in as far as regards confirmation pf testaments, to the sheriff or county courts.

The jurisdiction of the Admiralty cannot perhaps be traced to an earlier period than the beginning of the sixteenth century, when the office of lord justiciar, who was of old the supreme judge in all manner of causes, became hereditary in the noble family of Argyll, and the authority of the Admiralty was also long very limited. It was confined to seafaring causes, and in these it had no exclusive jurisdiction.^[33. See Leg. Burg. c. 27; Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. i. part i. p. 129, and part ii. p. 83; and A. S., 16th January 1554.] The earliest collection of maritime laws in Scotland, is that contained in Balfour’s Practicks, and entitled “The Sea Laws, collectit furth of the Actis of Parliament, the prac-tiques and lawis of Oberon, and the lawis of Wisbeig, and the constitutions of Francois, king of France, 1543, 1557.” This we conceive was the Lib. Kintor. referred to by Balfour, and the work of David Kintore, then judge of the Admiralty. Towards the end of the same century, Alexander King, advocate, filled the same office; and from the date of his Treatise on Maritime Law, apparently the first regular treatise on that branch of jurisprudence in Great Britain, the court of Admiralty rose into importance. By the act 1609, c. 15, it was declared a sovereign judicatory, and letters of homing were allowed on its decrees; and the reputation of the court being afterwards sustained by a succession of eminent judges, such as Acheson of Glencairney, Roberton of Beidlay, and Lyon of Carse, all of whom became lords of Session, it began to extend its jurisdiction generally to mercantile, and not, as before, to mere seafaring causes. The above act was then ratified by that of 1681, c. 16, by which the ground of the court was farther cleared and enlarged; the admiral being now also styled the high admiral, and declared the king’s lieutenant and justice-general on the high seas. By a later statute, provision was made for a stated salary of L.100 to the judge of the Admiralty. This was renewed by the act 1704, c. 8; and by 26 Geo. III. c. 47, the salary was made L.400, which was afterwards raised to L.800 a-year. The court, however, did not long enjoy this flow of prosperity By the 6 Geo. IV. c. 120, jurisdiction in prize and capture was withdrawn, and vested in the Admiralty of England; and by a later statute the court was altogether abolished, and its remaining jurisdiction transferred to the Court of Session, and Sheriff courts; the High Court of Justiciary having also previously re-acquired, as of old, a co-ordinate jurisdiction in crimes at sea.

An ancient species of exempt territory was that of sanctuary. The first of the sort were probably churches; and[7:19:758] in regard to them we find a rescript of Pope Innocent III. to the king of Scots,^[34. Decret. Greg. 46 3. Tit. 49. c. 6.] and thereupon the statute Alex. II. c. 6, which is among the earliest regulations on the subject in the Scotch law. There were of old divers sanctuaries, or, as they were termed, girths, (1469, c. 35; 1535, c. 23; 1555, c. 31), and mostly ecclesiastical; there being a constant rivalry at all times between the sovereign power and the ecclesiastical. But the only one now in use, is the sanctuary of Holyrood, which, besides usage, has two main foundations, namely, a religious house, and a royal palace, especially the former, the precincts being usually called the sanctuary of Holyroodhouse, and the court there the Abbey court. The jurisdiction of the place is administered by a bailie, who holds a court for debt, and other civil obligations, where the debtor dwells within the precincts.

Regalities were another species of exempt territory. They were rights of exclusive power and jurisdiction, civil and criminal, real and personal, granted by the crown to the higher nobility;^[35. * Regales, Cod. Theod. vii. 1, 9.] and though the impolicy of such grants had long been perceived, yet they were not altogether abolished till the passing of the jurisdiction act, in the middle of last century. By 1455, c. 43, it was enacted that all regalities in the king’s hands should be annexed to the royalty and made subject to the king’s courts and officers. It was about the date of that act that the great district of Kirkcudbright fell to the crown by the forfeiture of its lord; and a senes-challis being thereupon appointed, it has ever since remained the stewartry of Kirkcudbright. But neither this nor the islands of Orkney and Zetland, which were also erected into a stewartry,^[36. • See 1669, c. 13.] differs materially from a shire; each having a court perfectly of the nature of a sheriff or county court. Besides these, there were other stewartries, such as Strath-em and Menteith in Perthshire, and Annandale in Dumfries; but by the jurisdiction act, they merged into their respective shires.

Burghs form yet another species of exempt territory; the principal character of a burgh being its separate jurisdiction and independent government, but upon reasons altogether different from either sanctuaries or regalities. They arise neither from superstition nor princes’ favours. They have their origin in the wants and social tendencies of our nature; they are the chosen seats of civilization and the arts of life; and the distinction between them and shires pervades the entire political constitution of the country. There are three sorts of burghs, namely, burghs of barony, burghs of regality, and burghs of royalty or royal burghs; and in establishing these last, it would seem to have been the general policy of government to divide the realm into districts, in each of which a royal burgh was placed. Several of the burghs are counties of themselves, or counties corporate, such as Edinburgh, Stirling, Perth, Aberdeen, and Inverness; and these obviously contain within themselves all the elements of government and judicature. But it has unfortunately happened, that none of the burgh courts has kept pace with the advance of intelligence, the progress of trade, or the increase of commercial transactions. Justice continues to be administered there just as it was centuries ago. The consequence is, that the peculiar feature of the burghs as independent jurisdictions has in many cases given way; the burgh courts have been forsaken for the sheriff and justice of peace courts; and it seems to have become a public question of policy, whether they should not be altogether abolished. The same causes, however, which gave origin to burghs, remain; and therefore it would seem to be the wiser policy to improve the burgh courts, rather than to abolish them; to improve them, by relieving the magistrates of all, or at least the more important judicial duties, and to devolve these upon fixed and qualified judges.

The superintendence of the royal burghs was in the king’s chamberlain, who held ogres, or itinerant courts, at which the magistrates and burgesses of burghs were bound to give attendance, and where he heard and determined all charges made against them. He was also in use from the earliest times, to hold, in the southern part of the kingdom, courts of four boroughs; which were so called because composed of delegates from the four burghs, originally of Edinburgh, Stirling, Berwick, and Roxburgh, but afterwards of Edinburgh, Stirling, Lanark, and Linlithgow. These delegates assembled before the chamberlain, and formed for appeals from the chamberlain ayres, and the different burgh courts, a tribunal which was to burgesses what the high court of parliament was to the other inhabitants of the kingdom, the last and highest court of appeal. The northern burghs had been long under a peculiar government of their own. They formed a sort of Hanseatic league; for as early as the reign of William the Lyon, a royal charter was granted to the king’s burghers of Aberdeen and of Moray, and all beyond the Grampians, to hold their free “ansum” or hanse, as freely, quietly, fully, and honourably, as their predecessors had done in the time of the granter’s royal grandfather.^[37. Kennedy's Annals of Aberdeen, vol. i. p. 8.] In the beginning of the fifteenth century, a court of four boroughs was holden at Stirling, where it was resolved that deputies from each of the royal burghs south of the Spey should convene yearly to consider and conclude on all matters affecting the commonweal of the royal burghs, their liberty and court. This convention was in all likelihood formed in imitation of the northern Hanse. The inconvenience of having two separate yet similar assemblies in the kingdom, however, must have been quickly felt; and, at the same time, the ease and propriety of uniting them, and thus assimilating the regimen of all the burghs, obvious. Accordingly, in the end of the same century, an act of parliament was passed, (1487, c. 3.) appointing deputies from all the royal burghs, “baith north and south" to meet in convention yearly, thus forming the convention of royal burghs which has been ever since continued. The place of meeting was fixed at Inverkeithing, on the north of the Forth, probably from its central situation; but the convention soon removed to Edinburgh, which had long been the seat of the court of four boroughs, and was now become the metropolis of the kingdom. On the institution of the Court of Session, the court of four boroughs and the chamberlain ayres quickly fell into disuse, their judicial, and many of their ministerial functions having been engrossed by that court; and from the time of Malcolm lord Fleming, who fell at Pinkey in 1547, the office of chamberlain, or, as he was now styled, lord great chamberlain, ceased to be exercised. The convention, however, continued its yearly meetings; indeed, its records begin only at this time, when the Lord Provost of Edinburgh became by devolution its standing preses, and the Town-Clerk of Edinburgh its standing clerk.

Let us now return to the general and ordinary courts of the kingdom; the Court of Justiciary and Court of Session, the Sheriff Court, and the Bailie Courts of burghs.

The Court of Justiciary was originally the great pattern followed in the administration of justice throughout the kingdom; but soon after the institution of the Court of Session, an act passed (1540, c. 72.) requiring all sheriffs and other temporal judges to copy the proceedings, not of the justices, as before^[38. Stat. Rob. III. c. 33.] but of the Lords of Session; and the principle of this enactment was adopted in the recent judicature act regulating the forms of process in civil matters. The course of proceeding in ordinary actions is now generally as follows. The defendant, or, as he is called, the defender, is first summoned on the original writ to compear in court peremptorily[7:19:759] on a day named, the intervening days being held as inducite legales. If, when the cause is called, the defender do not appear, decree in absence may pass against him. If he appear, he is allowed certain days, termed inducite deliberatoriae, to see the original writ and productions, and determine whether and how he shall proceed. He then puts in his defence and plea, admitting or denying the facts alleged, stating any other facts which he offers to prove, and subjoining a summary of the pleas in law on which he means to found. The defences and all subsequent steps of procedure must be drawn by counsel; and after the defences are given in, every order in the cause must be moved for in court and determined by the judges. If the parties choose they may go to judgment on the summons and defences; but commonly more specific pleadings are ordered, such as a condescendence and answers, or mutual condescendences, which are similar to the responsive allegations of the ecclesiastical courts, and both are borrowed from the articuli et responsiones of the papal process. These papers being revised by the parties, the record, ready to be closed, is transmitted to the judge for private consideration; after which, it is put out by him for debate. Parties are then heard in court by their counsel, and the judge may thereupon either give judgment at once, or, as is commonly the case, take the proceedings to chambers again for consideration, and there write out his decision; or, if any difficulty occur in the determination of the case, he may report the point to the Inner House for their direction or decision; or again, if the cause involves details or difficulties, he may order cases, that is to say, full argumentative pleadings, and then either decide the cause or report it to the Inner House. When the Lord Ordinary gives an interlocutor or judgment, it may be carried to the Inner House by reclaiming note, upon which counsel are heard, and the decision of the Lord Ordinary either altered or adhered to, and with or without cost, as the court may determine.

In jury causes, that is to say, causes appropriated for trial by jury, or in which jury trial is to take place, the course of proceeding now pointed out is but partially followed. In such causes a record is made up in the manner described; but as the system of pleading adopted in the Scotch courts does not, as in the common law courts of England, bring out the issue whether of fact or law, issues must be prepared. This is done by an officer of court, and in settling issues there is frequently considerable difficulty. In the proceedings of sheriff and bailie courts, however, there is something like an approach to the English system, an answer or reply to the defence being allowed. But here the analogy ends. There is no rejoinder unless ordered; and from the multitude of pleas pleadable in each paper, a single issue, or indeed any issue, in the technical sense of the term, is never produced. It is also to be observed, that jury trials in civil causes gradually fell into disuse in the local courts after the institution of the Court of Session, where such mode of trial was unknown till recently introduced by statute; and it has not been re-established except in the Court of Session. The details of a jury trial, when it does take place, need not be specified here, though they differ in some few particulars from the like proceeding in England.

Of the several methods of defence and proof in criminal cases, the earliest, and at the same time the rudest, was battle, in which the parties litigant put the truth of their averment on the issue of a judicial combat.^[39. Quon. Att. c. 61, Leg. Burg. c. 24.] This method of trial, so truly barbarous, was termed the judgment of God, though that appellation came more peculiarly to designate another method of a different origin, but no less uncertain as a criterion of truth. This was ordeal, which, if not introduced, was at least continued and countenanced by the ecclesiastics. It was of various kinds, but those known in Scotland were water, fire, and iron;^[40. Stat. Will. c. 7, 15; Stat. Alex. II. c. 7∙] and accordingly, as the accused was able to bear applications of these, so accordingly was he judged guilty or innocent. Another method of trial used also instead of battle, was that by compurgators, where the defendant exculpated or purged himself of the guilt imputed to him, by declaring his innocence on oath, and also producing a number of persons to swear that they believed he swore truly, which they did in general on their knowledge of his character.^[41. ’ Quon. Att. c, 5, §. 7; Leg. Burg, c. 24,] But all these methods of trial have been abolished, or have gradually become obsolete, which leads us to notice the course of proceeding now in use in ordinary cases.

The first step is to commit the accused for examination, when, if no case is made out, he is dismissed, otherwise he is committed for trial. From that moment he may sue out and “run his letters,” a proceeding analogous to the habeas corpus. Trial being determined on, the accused is summoned to the day fixed, being at the same time served with a duplicate of the indictment or criminal letters, and lists of the assize (jurors) and witnesses on his own behalf. On the day of compearance, he must appear personally, (otherwise he is outlawed,) and stand at the bar or pannel whence he is termed the pantiel; but in all cases he is allowed counsel and agent. If, on arraignment, he has no special matter to plead, the libel is read to him, and his confession, if made, is recorded. If any special plea on the relevancy is offered, it is determined by the judges on oral or written argument. Issue being joined, the evidence on both sides is laid before the court and jury, which are now impannelled for that purpose. The jury are then addressed by the pannel or his counsel, and the evidence is afterwards summed up by the presiding judge, with adirection in law to the jury; when the jury, after deliberation, return, unanimously, or by a majority, a verdict of guilty, not proven, or not guilty, as the case may be. A verdict of not guilty declares the prisoner’s innocence; a verdict of not proven indicates suspicion, but insufficient proof of guilt; and in the case of a verdict of guilty, but in that only, sentence is pronounced. The nature of the sentence depends not only on the crime, but also on the public prosecutor; for of a long time past that officer has been in use to exercise a power to restrict the pains of law. This important power is commonly exercised with great discretion; yet undoubtedly it is a dangerous one to hold, and to it more, perhaps, than to any other cause whatever, is to be ascribed the singularly lax state of the criminal law of Scotland in reference to the punishment for crime.

There seems little doubt but that in early times the king was public prosecutor, as he was also generalissimo and chief justice of the kingdom. His great officer, the justiciar, who followed him, as we have seen, in the two latter capacities, followed him likewise in the capacity of public prosecutor; and what the justiciar did throughout the realm generally, the same did the sheriff in his particular county. Accordingly, we find it enacted in our early law that if any stranger remained in a town longer than a night without finding a pledge or surety for his good behaviour, “the justiciar or the sheriff shall accuse him;"^[42. Quon. Ate. c. 63.] and so late as the middle of the fifteenth century it was enacted “that all mairs and serjeants arrest at the sheriff’s bidding, albeit na party follower be, all trespassers, and that the sheriff follow said trespassers in the king’s name, gif na party follower appears,” (1436, c. 140.) In process of time however, as the principles of civil liberty and the elements of our constitution came to be better understood, distinct officers were appointed to the different departments of the State; and this office of public prosecutor naturally devolved upon the crown counsel. The principal of these is the lord advocate, and next to[7:19:760] him is the solicitor-general, an officer derived from the English courts, and probably not known in Scotland earlier than the union of the crowns in the beginning of the seventeenth century. There are also four standing deputies to the lord advocate, or “advocate deputes,” as they are termed, who had their origin by the act 1587, c. 82, which divided the realm into circuits for the administration of criminal justice. The procurators fiscal of the county and burgh courts, who arc the public prosecutors in their respective districts, may also be regarded as deputies of the lord advocate. It is true they do not derive their authority from him; but they communicate with him in the prosecution of criminals, and in that department have generally the same powers and duties. The following table will shew the great importance of public prosecutor.

The following statement will also give some idea of the working of the criminal jurisdictions of Scotland. It relates to the year 1836. In that year there were 2922 persons charged with crime in the several counties and burghs of Scotland. Of these 289 were discharged without trial, and 219 from other causes; and of the remaining 2414, there were tried by the Justiciary, 574, (viz. 173 in the high court, and 404 on circuit); by sheriffs, 1325,(viz.547with jury, and 778 without jury); and5l5 by burgh magistrates, justices of the peace, and others. Of the above 2414 also, 2152 were convicted; in 194 cases the charges were found not proven; 30 were declared not guilty; 36 were outlawed, and two were found insane on arraignment. And finally, of the 2152 convicted, 1647 were sentenced to imprisonment of different periods, 305 were condemned to transportation for different periods, 187 were punished by fine, 6 were discharged on sureties, 2 had sentence of death, 1 was executed, and 5 received no sentence.

Next in dignity to the crown counsel is the dean of faculty, facultatis juridicoe decanus; or rather we should say that between these learned personages there has been a contest waged, the latter claiming precedence of the former. This claim, however, seems to be just a residuum of the once greater claims of the whole college of justice, and the dispute but a continuation of the conflict formerly maintained by the court against all power except its own. The place of dean of faculty has been held by some of the first men of the kingdom; and in the course of the last two hundred years there have been no less than three instances of elevation from it at once to the presidentcy of the Court of Session, Sir George Lockhart, Sir Hugh Dalrymple, and Mr. Blair. But in all the common elements of rank there cannot be a doubt of its inferiority to that of crown counsel.

According to the original constitution of the Court of Session, the members were associated into a college, with a view to a collegiate or common life; the judges or lords of Session being “senators” of the college, and the advocates the facultas juridica, or faculty of law, subordinate to whom were the students of law, or “servitors,” as they were termed, who were attached to particular advocates as their pupils in the study of the law. The celebrated Sir Thomas Hope was in early life a “servitor” to Sir Thomas Nicolson. The term “servitor” was a college term, well known in the University of Oxford; but it has gone out of use with us, those formerly so designed being now termed “advocates’ first clerks.” But to what extent such intention was ever carried out, or whether any thing existed here in the nature of the English laws of court or Doctors Commons, does not appear. At present there is nothing of the sort. The original entry money to the Faculty was L.40 Scotch, and so it continued till 1672, the year in which the statute for the regulation of the judicatories passed, when the sum was raised to 200 merks. In the beginning of last century it had advanced to L.40 sterling, and now, after repeated advances, the fees of entry are upwards of 250 guineas besides extras. The number of the Faculty which, forty years ago, was about 260, is at present about 470, averaging of late about twelve in the year; but a fourth part only are in attendance on the courts.

The distinction of counsel and agents in Scotch practice is of modern origin. The earliest agents properly so called, or practitioners below the bar, were the “servitors” above mentioned, or advocates’ first clerks in the Court of Session; and all others were forbidden to act as agents.^[43. See AS. 13th July 1596, Stat. 1672, c. 16, and AS. '26th February 1678.] By the injunctions of their chief officer, the Secretary of State, in 1594, Writers to the Signet were also prohibited from acting as agents; and by a bye law of the body itself in 1676, every member who should take it upon him to act as an agent, was made liable to be prosecuted. They came at length, however, to act likewise as agents, and are now a large and influential body. Sixty years ago they were not more than 100; but about forty years ago they were 280. At present they are upwards of 700 in number, and almost all of them resident in Edinburgh; and the average entries yearly are the same in proportion as into the Faculty. There is another class of agents, the Solicitors before the supreme courts, enrolled under AS. 9 July 1754, and AS. 1772. They are upwards of a hundred in number, which is somewhat more than the enrolled number of advocates’ first clerks, a body which lias remained much about the same for the last forty years.

With respect to the procurators of the inferior courts, they appear to have generally continued, till recent times, on the same close footing on which the practitioners of all the courts stood previous to the institution of the Court of Session; nor are they to this day admitted by the supreme court, or marshalled, like the bar, into one body, but are severally admitted, on varying qualifications, by the respective courts throughout the kingdom. They are of course restricted to the particular court so admitting them; whereas the advocates of the College of Justice form the proper bar of Scotland, and being admitted by the supreme court, may practise in any court of the kingdom. The same principle might be extended with evident advantage; and the local courts opened up to the talent and practical skill of the agents of the Court of Session. The present arrangements are very plainly imperfect, and incapable of maturing a uniform and settled system of jurisprudence in the country. There is not a tenth part of the law business of the country conducted by the counsel and agents of the supreme court. Unless a different provision is made, both the law and the legal profession of Scotland will inevitably suffer.

In the style of the procurators of Aberdeen, there is a peculiarity which may here be taken notice of and explained. They are styled advocates, which name is otherwise appropriated to the advocates of the College of Justice. The truth is that the appellation of advocate is amongst the earliest which we find in our records applied to practitioners[7:19:761] Statistical Table of the Judicature of Scotland.
[table]

of the law, (1424, c. 45); and it appears that persons so designated were formerly’ in every court of the kingdom, (1424, c. 45, 1429, c. 11G—125.) The term was used synonymously with procurators; and at the institution of the Court of Session both terms were applied together, (1537, c. 64.) The sheriff court of Aberdeen was the earliest county court regulated subsequent to the erection of the Court of Session; and in the act of court then passed, the two names were used promiscuously. Hence has arisen the common use of the style of advocate; but the advocates of Aberdeen form no part of the proper bar of Scotland, any more than the practitioners of any of the local courts whatsoever. The entry of procurators of Edinburgh was not regulated by the sheriff till 1765, and for fifteen years more they remained unincorporated. It was still later before the procurators of Glasgow were erected into a corporation; and it was not till above thirty-five years ago that the procurators of Paisley were incorporated.

We have now a word or two to say with respect to the garb of the profession. The proper habit of the bar is the long robe which now characterises the profession, and which seems to have been adopted by the advocates of the College of Justice as the ecclesiastical array. Anciently, however, a sort of cloak or tabard of green was worn, (1455, c. 45.) which colour it will be recollected, was symbolical of learning amongst the ancient Britons; and accordingly that class of their priesthood called Ovats, and who professed the liberal arts, wore habits of green. In the burgh court of Edinburgh the cloak was worn till the beginning of the seventeenth century, when the procurators were required to wear gowns instead.

It remains to advert shortly to the executive officers of the law. These are, properly speaking, the sheriffs in their respective counties, and the magistrates in the burghs; and in the criminal warrants of the superior courts this is clear. But the ordinary civil process of the Court of Session is exe cuted by the messengers and other officers at-arms; and the like process of the sheriff and bailie courts is executed by the sheriff and burgh officers respectively. The messengers-at-arms amount to upwards of two hundred in number, and are distributed throughout the different shires and districts of the kingdom. They are all associated, however, under the Lyon herald, king of arms, who, as head of the office or college of arms, has authority and jurisdiction over all the members and officers of the establishment. In this respect the Lord Lyon may be regarded as essentially at the head of the civil branch of the executive department of the law; and accordingly it might deserve consideration whether it would not be expedient, with a view at once to give unity of management to the entire department, and also to relieve the sheriff of all but judicial duties, to devolve upon the Lord Lyon and his officers the execution of process of every kind, and the whole ministerial powers of the sheriff, in as far as these are executive, or auxiliary to the courts of law.

In order to give a clear and concise view of the manner in which justice is distributed throughout Scotland by means of the circuit courts of justiciary, and the courts of the sheriffs-depute and sheriffs-substitute, not including the burgh and justice of peace courts, the following Tables are subjoined.

The great divisions of the realm in early times were Lothian, Galloway, and Scotland. In the first of these, justice-ayres were holden at Edinburgh, Peebles, and soon afterwards Glasgow; and if we credit the Reg. Mag. lib. ii, c. 20, the loca capitalia Scotioe were, Scone for Gowry, Cluny for Stormonth, Rait for Athole, Dalguish for Fife, Perth for Strathearn, Forfar for Angus, Aberdeen for Mar and Buchan, and Inverness for Ross and Moray. The judicial districts assigned by king Edward I., in 1305, were Lothian, Galloway, beyond the Forth to the Grampians, and beyond the Grampians. At the institution of the Court of Session in 1532, the realm was divided, for the purposes of civil judicature, into four quarters, as follows :—

Forfar, Kincardine, Aberdeen, Banff, Elgin, Forres, Naim, Inverness, Cromarty.

Edinburgh, Haddington, Linlithgow, Berwick, Roxburgh, Peebles, Selkirk,

Dumfries, Annandale, Kirkcudbright, Ayr, Wigton, Lanark, Renfrew, Stirling,

Dunbarton, Argyle, Bute, Clackmannan, Kinross, Fife,

Perth.

By 1587, c. 82, the realm was divided, for the purposes of criminal judicature, into four quarters, of seven shires each, but these are not stated.

The divisions which are recognized under this head are counties or shires, and parishes. Of the counties, the origin of which is very ancient, and has not been ascertained, a list, and other particulars respecting them, have already been given. They are thirty-three in number, but most of them are subdivided by local acts of parliament into two or more districts, for the purpose of police and internal economy; and several of them comprehend a variety of territorial divisions, founded on the natural circumstances of the country. Thus the county of Berwick is popularly divided into the three districts of the Merse, Lauderdale, and Lammermuir; Lanarkshire into the upper, middle, and lower wards; Ayrshire into Kyle, Cunningham, and Carrick; and in the extensive Highland counties, the subdivisions are still more numerous. There is no trace in Scotland of the minor divisions of the English counties, called hundreds, wapentakes, and the like. Of the judicial divisions of Scotland an account will be found in this article under the head of Judicial Establishments. Respecting the date of the erection of parishes, there have been various conjectures. They were purely an ecclesiastical regulation, and could not have been formed till the Christian system had been generally received, and its preachers become numerous; and as this division, and the necessary previous ecclesiastical establishment, infer no inconsiderable degree of civilization, it is highly probable that it did not take place before the ninth or the tenth century.^[44. Murray's Literary History of Galloway, 2d edit. 1832, p. 7.] Mr. Chalmers supposes that parishes were gradually formed after the year 843; but that they existed in the time of Malcolm III., who died in 1093, is ascertained by authentic records.^[45. Caledonia, vol. i. p. 23.] The number of parishes has not been uniform. Previously to the Reformation the bishops possessed the power of uniting or disjoining parishes. Between this period and the Union, in 1707, the authority was transferred from the bishops and vested in several successive commissions of the Scottish parliament. In 1707, parliament vested this power in the Court of Session, but confined the power of the court to cases where consent had previously been given by persons possessing three-fourths of the valued rental of the parish; and this is the existing law. The disjoining or union of parishes is, therefore, attended with considerable difficulty, and very rarely takes place, except in cities where the consent of the municipal authorities, if patrons of the parish, and of the presbytery of the bounds, is sufficient for the purpose. Hence in Edinburgh five new parishes have been erected out of the parish of St. Cuthbert’s, within the last forty years. The number of parishes is at present 916, exclusive of what arc commonly called quoad sacra parishes. These latter parishes have been formed in either of the two following ways. First, owing to the inconvenient extent of parishes in the Highlands, and the consequent distance of many of the people from the parish church, missionaries[7:19:763] supported by a royal grant, were appointed to certain localities with the privileges quoad spiritualia of parochial clergymen, except that they could not be constituent members of any of the church courts, and could not even have sessions of their own. But in the year 1833, these localities were, by an act of the General Assembly, converted into parishes quoad sacra, and their ministers declared to be constituent members of the ecclesiastical courts. The number of these new parishes is forty-one. Secondly, from the many difficulties attending the erection of new parishes, means have been introduced, in addition to the establishment of the new quoad sacra parishes referred to, to supersede the necessity of such a step; and this object was accomplished by the institution of “chapels of ease,” or subsidiary places of worship, without any assigned locality. These parishes, the first of which was erected in 1798, amounted in 1834 to sixty-six, when the General Assembly conferred on them the same rights and privileges which belong to parish ministers, and appointed them a certain defined locality quoad sacra. Since that period they have greatly increased in number, and are yearly increasing, so that it would be both difficult and unnecessary to ascertain the exact amount. But they do not affect the original parishes in any way, except in regard to the spiritualities.

Church of Scotland. The reformation from popery began at an early period in Scotland, but was not triumphant until the year 1560, when popery was abolished, and the protestant religion established by act of parliament in its stead. But whilst popery was abolished, the protestants could not agree amongst themselves as to the system of ecclesiastical polity which should be established in its place. Episcopacy, or the government of the church by bishops, received the support of the king and of many of the most powerful families; whilst presbytery, or the polity introduced by Knox from Geneva, where he had studied under Calvin, was embraced by the great body of the people. But amidst the struggle for pre-eminence, the presbyterians, who constituted five-sixths of the protestant population, took matters into their own hand, and embodied their ecclesiastical system in a work entitled The Second Book of Discipline, ^[46. The First Book of Discipline was presented by the reformers to the parliament of 1560, which abolished popery; but it was not ratified by the legislature, though it was subscribed by a great many of its members as private individuals. But the parliament, though it did not give the sanction of its authority to The First Book of Discipline, accepted and confirmed the Confession of Faith drawn up by the protestants, the object of which being not so much to establish any particular set of doctrines as to abjure popery; and hence it is called the Negative Confession. Another Confession of Faith, or National Covenant, as it was called, was drawn up in 1580, and subscribed by the king, his household, and by persons of all ranks in the state, but not confirmed by parliament. (Knox’s History of the Reformation. Peterkin's Compendium of the Law of the Church of Scotland.)] 1 which was ordered by the General Assembly that met in 1581, to be engrossed in the registers of the church as ecclesiastical law, and which has ever since formed the basis of the polity of the established presbyterian church of Scotland. This Assembly first divided the country into presbyteries and Synods.^[47. Cook’s History of the Church, I. chap. iv.]

But whilst presbytery was thus the religion of the people, it did not receive the sanction either of the Privy Council or Parliament. On the contrary, in 1584, episcopacy was established as the national church; presbytery was declared illegal; and the presbyterian clergy were exposed to much obloquy and persecution. But the public voice again got the ascendancy; and presbytery was for the first time ratified by act of parliament, in 1592, as the national church. But not being acceptable to the king and the court, this polity was superseded by episcopacy in 1606; nor did it again obtain the supremacy till the famous General Assembly, held at Glasgow in 1638, which abolished prelacy, and restored the presbyterian form of worship. The proceedings and acts of this Assembly were afterwards confirmed by the king and the parliament. But in 1660, on the restoration of

Charles II., presbytery was compelled again to give way to episcopacy, which maintained the predominance till the Revolution. The act of William and Mary, re-establishing presbytery, was passed in 1690.^[48. Cook’s History; Baillie's Letters and Journal; and acts of General Assembly.] Standards of the church. To the celebrated Assembly of Divines that met in Westminster in 1643, the presbyterian church of Scotland, which was represented in that meeting by commissioners chosen by herself, is indebted for her standards both as to her formularies and her doctrines. To the deliberations of this assembly she is indebted for a Directory of Public Worship, a Form of Ordination, the Larger and Shorter Catechisms, and the Confession of Faith; all which were adopted by the General Assembly, and confirmed by the Scottish parliament, as agreeable to the word of God.^[49. Baillie, passim; and Murray’s Life of Samuel Rutherford, chap, viii, 193—217.] The doctrines of the church are Calvinistic, the leading tenets being predestination, original sin, particular redemption, irresistible grace, justification by faith, and the perseverance of the saints.

Parishes. Every parish in Scotland enjoys the privilege of having a resident clergyman; residence being obligatory by law as early as the year 1563. The number of parishes, according to the civil law, is 916; and of these 27 are collegiate, that is, have each the services of two clergymen, who preach alternately in the same place of worship. The whole number of parishes, both civil and quoad sacra, was, in 1836, 1023; so that, including the collegiate charges, the whole number of clergymen is 1050.

Church Judicatories. The Kirk-session is the lowest court. It is composed of the minister of the parish and the lay elders. The minister is officially moderator or president of the session. This court takes cognizance of cases of scandal, of the poor’s fund, and of parochial ecclesiastical discipline. There is a power of appeal from the session to the presbytery, which is the next court in dignity.

The Presbytery is composed of a number of contiguous parishes. A presbytery consists of the ministers of all the parishes within its limits; of the professor of divinity, if there be any university within its bounds, and of a lay-elder from each parish. The presbytery takes young men on trial as students of divinity, and candidates for licence; ordains presentees to vacant livings; and has the superintendence of religion and education within its precincts. Its decision is not final, if an appeal be lodged to the synod. A presbytery generally meets monthly; and it must necessarily meet at least twice a-year. The number of presbyteries is eighty.

The Synod is composed of two or more presbyteries. It consists of every parish minister within its limits, and of the elders who last represented the different sessions in the presbytery. There is a power of appeal from the synod to the General Assembly. The number of synods is sixteen.

The General Assembly is the highest ecclesiastical court, its decisions being final. It meets annually in the month of May, and sits for ten successive days. It is honoured with the presence of a nobleman as representative of the sovereign, under the title of Lord High Commissioner. But this high functionary has no voice in the deliberations of the court; and even his presence is not absolutely necessary. The Assembly, unlike the inferior courts, consists of representatives from the presbyteries, royal burghs, and universities of Scotland, formerly from the church of Camp-[7:19:764] vere, now extinct, and from the churches in the East Indies, connected with the Church of Scotland.^[50.

We may here state that the course of study for the church is abundantly ample, extending at least to eight years in one or more of the Scottish universities. The first four years are devoted to literary and philosophical study; the other four to Hebrew, church history, and theology properly so called. After this course of study is ended, a young man can be taken on trials by the presbytery for licence as a preacher or probationer. The average annual income of the Scottish clergy, which is generally derived from teinds or tithes,^[51. The history of tithes, or teinds in Scotland, since the Reformation, is involved and intricate. We need not enter on the consideration of the subject here, but merely state that, at the approach of the Reformation, most of the teinds, and much of the property of the church were alienated, and bestowed on laymen, or devolved on the crown. But to overlook the intermediate steps, the greatest change which took place in the matter was in the reign of Charles the First, who revoked all the ecclesiastical grants (except the church lands) which had been made during the two preceding reigns. This revocation having taken place, though with difficulty, it was provided that the lands, except such as had been already appropriated to the payment of stipend, should be valued and sold. The landholders were entitled to sue for a valuation or modus, and to purchase the teinds of their own estates. To facilitate the inquiry into the value of teinds, commissioners and sub-commissioners were appointed, the latter of whom were enjoined to visit their several parishes, and to report to the commissioners. Some of their reports, when made, were sanctioned; others have been brought forward for approval at later periods. The result was, that by far the greater part of the teinds have been bought up by the proprietors of the respective lands, after stipends, commuted into a money payment, had been modified to the clergymen, the teinds being held by these proprietors under the condition of augmenting, if necessary, such stipends to the extent of their value; in other words, there are in these cases no tithes or teinds, but part of the rent of the proprietors constitutes ministers’ stipend, and a certain additional portion, in cases where the valuation is not exhausted, is still liable to augmentation of stipend. In cases where no valuation has taken place, the value of the teinds is calculated at one-fifth of the existing rent, and is also paid in money. The body of commissioners just spoken of, continued to act from the date of their appointment, to the Union in 1707, at which period the Court of Session was authorised to supply their place, and to determine in all cases of valuation and sale of teinds. As the commissioners had been empowered to modify the stipends of the ministers, the same power was transferred to the Court of Session. A clergyman is entitled, when the teinds of the parish are not exhausted, to apply to the Court for an augmentation of his stipend, which it is competent for that Court either to grant or refuse. But, whether granted or not, twenty years must elapse before such applications can be renewed. The stipend generally consists of so many chalders of grain. The value of the grain is determined by the fiar prices, which are struck in each county in Scotland in the month of February or March annually; and this value, which necessarily varies yearly, is then payable in money. The teinds are also appropriated to the building of parish churches and manses, and the keeping of them in repair. The ministers of Edinburgh and Montrose are paid not by teinds, but by a local tax, levied on the occupiers of houses; a circumstance that has been the source, particularly in Edinburgh, of much irritation and discontent. (Sir J. Connel on Teinds, passim. Dunlop's Parochial Law. Burton’s Manual of the Law of Scotland, pp. 100—116.)] is supposed to be about L.200, exclusive of the manse and glebe. In parishes where the teinds have been exhausted, or do not produce to the clergyman an income of L.150, the government has provided a fund, so as to raise such income to this minimum amount. The parishes thus assisted are called bounty livings, and amount to 208.^[52. • Peterkin’s Supplement. Dunlop's Parochial Law.] Dissenters. The great body of the Scottish dissenters are presbyterians, entertaining Calvinistic opinions, and recognising the same confession of faith and the same standards as the members of the established church; they abandoned that church in consequence of certain alleged errors in discipline, and particularly the undue exercise of patronage, for lay-patronage has always obtained, with more or less vigour in the Scottish establishment, except for more than twenty years prior to 1712. (See Seceders.)

The dissenting body next in importance to the United Associate Synod, is the Relief, which was founded in 1755. The founders of this sect professed to differ from the Established Church on no other point than the right of patrons to appoint ministers against the inclinations of the people.^[53. M*Kerrows History of the Secession, vol. i. p∙ 361-8.] But the breach between this body of dissenters and the Establishment has now become wader; while the different sections of dissenters seem more disposed to union among themselves. The two numerous bodies of the Secession and the Relief, are at present (1839) engaged in making advances towards a union of these denominations. The Original Burgher Associate Synod declined to join the coalition formed between the Burghers and Antiburghers in 1820. The different congregations belonging to this sect are, with few exceptions, disposed to join the Established Church; indeed, some of them have already done so. There is another class of presbyterian dissenters, generally called Cameronians, but who assume the title of the Reformed Presbyterian Synod, who are the successors and representatives of the Covenanters in the time of Charles the First and his son. This small but interesting body refused to accept the settlement of Presbytery, as cstabli3hcd by law in 1690, unless the king should consent to subscribe the Solemn League and Covenant, and the standards of the Church. The Cameronians are, perhaps to this day, the most rigid presbyterians in Scotland. But without descending into particulars, the following table will afford a pretty correct view of the extent and importance of the different religious bodies in Scotland.^[54.

Majority of Established Church over all othcr∙sects, 177[7:19:765] We have not included the Jews in the foregoing enumeration, as they do not perhaps amount to above a hundred in all Scotland. Some of the dissenting congregations, besides, are very small; and we do not think it probable that the dissenters amount to much more than the fourth part of the whole population of Scotland, assigning to the Established Church all who do not attend any dissenting place of worship.

The subject of education engaged the attention of the Scottish Parliament even in comparatively rude times, viz. as early as the year 1494. The protestant church zealously took up the subject, and many acts of the General Assembly were passed in support of it. But it was not till 1616 that the Privy Council interposed and passed an act in favour of parish schools; nor was it till seventeen years afterwards, that this act of Council was ratified by Parliament. The disturbed state of the times prevented the act from becoming operative; and it was not, in truth, till some time after the Revolution, namely, in 1696, that the celebrated statute of William and Mary was passed, which forms the foundation of the present parochial system. The provisions of this act were immediately carried into effect in most parishes; and now the system is in universal operation throughout Scotland. The landowners and clergymen have it in their power, according to law, to establish more than one school in a parish, if circumstances seem to demand it; in which case the salary assigned to each of the teachers is less than the maximum sum (L.34, 4s. 4 ½ d.) given when there is only one schoolmaster in a parish. From a Parliamentary paper,^[55. Educational Inquiry, Scotland, Session 1837, vol. xlvii.] we learn, that the number of parochial schools in Scotland is 1047; that the number of teachers is 1170; that the aggregate amount of the salaries paid to them is L.29,642, 18s. 11 1 / 4 .; and that their total income, including salaries, fees, and all other emoluments, but exclusive of their dwelling-house and garden, is L.55,339, 17s. 1 ½ d., being an average of only L.47, 5s. 11 ¾. to each teacher. But ill-paid though the teachers be, they are, generally speaking, a well educated and meritorious class of men; and the parochial system has given such a stimulus to education, that the endowed schools have been found, in the progress of society, to be too few to answer the demand for instruction on the part of the people. Hence it appears from the same official document, that the number of schools not parochial, is not less than 3995, and the number of teachers 4469, being nearly four times the amount of the parochial schools and teachers.^[56. Under the head of schools non-parochial, are included those established by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, namely, 340; those founded by the General Assembly’s Education Committee, namely, 89; and those instituted by the different dissenting congregations.] The greatest number of pupils attending the parochial schools between Ladyday and Michaelmas 1833, was 71,426; and the lowest number was 50,029∙ The greatest number attending the schools not parochial, between the same dates, was 189,427; and the lowest number was 139,237. What the incomes of the non-parochial teachers may be, we have no data to judge. They are pretty high in our large towns, but miserably low, perhaps not above ten shillings a-week, in rural districts. Taking the average of the preceding number of pupils, attending both the parochial and non-parochial schools, namely, 225,061, the inference is, that 10 ½ out of 100 of the population are at school; but when we take into account the number of female seminaries, of private boarding schools for boys, and children taught in private families by governesses and tutors, not to mention Sabbath evening schools and classes for religious instruction, we may with propriety conclude, that at least 9 1 / 2 out of every 100 of the population are at the same time under tuition; a larger proportion than is known to be similarly situated, excepting in particular districts, in any other country of Europe.

The origin of the Scottish universities is not of any remote date. But as early as the year 1282, Dervorgille, wife of John Balliol, founded and endowed a college at Oxford for the reception of Scottish students; and, in 1,326, a college, known by the name of the Scotch college, was founded and endowed at Paris by David Murray, bishop of Moray, for a similar purpose.^[57. Irving's Lives of Scottish Poets, 2d edit. vol. i. p. 61.] But at length Scotland enjoyed the advantages of universities within the limits of her own territory. That of St. Andrews, the oldest in the kingdom, was founded by papal authority in 1413; that of Glasgow, by the same authority, in 1450; that of Aberdeen, also under the sanction of the pope, in 1494, though education did not commence there till 1500; and that of Edinburgh, founded by the presbyterians, in 1582. The university of St. Andrews consisted at one time of three colleges, instituted at different periods, viz. St. Salvador’s, St. Leonard’s, and St. Mary’s; hut in 1748, the two first were united, and the buildings of St. Leonard’s were alienated and converted into dwelling-houses. The university of Aberdeen consists of two colleges; King’s, founded, as just stated, in 1494; and Marischal college, instituted and endowed by George Keith, Earl Marischal, in 1593. The universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh contain one college each; but embrace all the faculties in their course of instruction. The following table shews the number of professors in the different universities, with the date of their foundation.
[table]

When founded.

Each of these universities enjoys the privilege of conferring literary honours in all the faculties. The aggregate number of students attending all these seminaries is about 2900, of whom about 1300 belong to the university of Edinburgh; 1100 to that of Glasgow; and the remainder to Aberdeen and St. Andrews, the attendance on the latter not exceeding 130. There are no religious tests to exclude students from any of our Scottish colleges. Jews, Catholics, Protestants, enjoy the same privileges. But the professors should, according to law, belong to the Established Church, and are liable to be called upon to sign her standards. This condition, however, is not always exacted. The session extends from the beginning of November till the end of April. There are a few summer classes in the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, but these extend only to three months preceding the first of August. A Royal Commission was appointed in 1826 for visiting the universities and colleges of Scotland, and in 1830 gave in a voluminous report. Another Commission was nominated in 1836, for visiting the university of Aberdeen. Their report has just been presented. But though a bill was brought into Parliament in 1836, founded on the former report, providing for a general board of visitors appointed by the crown over all the universities, that bill was withdrawn; and no measure on the subject has since been brought forward.

Though poor-rates are not generally imposed in Scotland, yet a law involving a compulsory assessment for the support of the impotent poor, was passed as early as the year 1576. But the very existence of such a statute seemed nearly unknown till about the middle of last century. “As long as there was no secession of presbyterians from the Established Church, the weekly collections, under the[7:19:766] management of the kirk-session, were in general found sufficient for the management of the poor. In some years of peculiar hardship or scarcity, such as the four last years of the seventeenth century, or the year 1740, voluntary assistance was no doubt given; and in some instances temporary assessments were resorted to, to enable the kirk-sessions to meet the usual emergencies. But on all ordinary occasions the resources of the kirk-sessions were considered as sufficient, and continued to be so at least as late as 1755.”^[58. Sir Henry Monereiff's Life of Dr. Erskine, p. 468.] And as legal assessments were reluctantly introduced, notwithstanding the existence of a law in their favour, so they have spread tardily. At this moment they embrace only 236 parishes, being little more than a fourth of the total parishes of Scotland. These assessments have not only been introduced, but are the heaviest, in the parishes bordering on England; and with the exception of our larger towns, they decrease or disappear as we recede from the infectious example of the sister kingdom. Thus every parish in the synod of Merse and Teviotdale is burdened with assessment. In the midland synods, less than the half of the parishes are assessed; whilst in the northern synods, embracing 157 parishes, only three are exposed to that burden.

Both these institutions have long existed in Scotland, but were based till recently on an insecure foundation. With the view of putting them on a sound footing, the act of 10 Geo. IV., c. 56, and of 4 and 5 Will. IV., c. 40, were passed. All friendly societies, claiming the benefits of these acts, are obliged to submit a statement of their rules and regulations for the approval of the officer appointed by government for the purpose; and these must receive his sanction ere the parties become entitled to the privileges conferred by the act in question, namely, the being allowed to invest the funds of the society in government securities at a minimum rate of interest (2 ½ d. per cent. per day), and in the funds of savings banks. Upwards of five hundred friendly societies have been instituted on the principle of these acts. The act as to savings banks, which has been in operation in all other parts of the empire since 1819, was extended to Scotland in 1835. According to the provisions of this act, the money of savings banks can be invested in government securities at the rate of L.3, 16s. 0 ½ d. per cent.; but the interest paid to depositors is not to exceed 2 ½ d. per cent. per day, or L.3, 8s. 5 ¼ d. per cent. per annum. No individual can deposit more than L.30 in any one year, exclusive of interest, nor more than L.200 in all. Savings banks have been established under the law in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Cupar, Kirkaldy, Dunfermline, Dalkeith, and other towns. The deposits in the Edinburgh institution amount to about L.170,000, in rather less than 3 1 / 2 years; and the other savings banks in Scotland have been equally successful.

The peers of Scotland, by the treaty of union, elect sixteen of their number to be their representatives in the House of Lords. This election takes place in the palace of Holyrood on the dissolution of parliament. These sixteen peers, who are not elected for life, as is the case with the Irish representative peers, but for the continuance of the parliament for which they are chosen, enjoy all the privileges of the peers of

England. The other peers of Scotland have all the privileges of the House of Lords, except the legislative and judicial powers, and the privileges thence arising. The number of Scottish peers at the union was one hundred and fifty-four; and there has been since restored five, making one hundred and fifty-nine; but the present number is eighty-three, namely, seven dukes, four marquises, thirty-nine earls, three countesses, six viscounts, twenty-three barons, and one baroness. Thirty-six of these are also British peers; and two are likewise peers of Ireland.

Scotland, before the passing of the reform bill in the year 1832, was represented in the House of Commons by forty-five members, thirty being returned by the counties, and fifteen by the royal burghs, sixty-six in number. The number of the Scottish representatives since the passing of the reform bill, is fifty-three, thirty being, as before, chosen by the counties, whilst the burghs and towns, seventy-six in number, of which ten are not royal burghs, send twentythree. The counties, thirty-three in number, return only thirty members, because, for parliamentary objects, Kinross and Clackmannan, Elgin and Nairn, and Ross and Cromarty, are respectively united. The aggregate number of the county freeholders or voters, at the passing of the reform act, was 3211. The burgh constituencies were still more limited. With the exception of Edinburgh, which sent a member of itself, the other burghs were parcelled out in groups, and each burgh in the group voted by a delegate chosen by the magistrates and towncouncil., amounting, upon an average, to twenty in each, or 1320 in all. The aggregate number of the county constituencies, in 1838-39, was 46,480, or nearly fifteen limes the former amount; and of the burgh constituencies, 36,373, or fully twenty-seven times its former extent. The total constituency of Scotland is 82,853.^[61. Burton's Manual, ut supra, p. 29, et seq.]

The population of Scotland was supposed to be 1,050,000[7:19:767] in the year 1700; it was ascertained by Dr. Webster to be 1,265,380, in 1755; and the authors of the Statistical Account of Scotland afford the means of estimating its amount about 1798, when it appears to have been 1,526,492. Since the year 1801, inclusive, we have had four decennial census. The following table gives the population of Scotland at the different periods referred to, with the rates of increase in each decennial period since 1801, and the number of males and females in 1831.
[table]

The amount of square miles, as stated under a previous head, being 29,600, the average population is within a fraction of eighty to the square mile. Great as has been the advance of population since the beginning of the last century, and particularly since 1801, it has been considerably less than its progress during the same period in England or Ireland. This desirable result seems to have been owing principally to the consolidation of farms in the low country; the extinction of the cottier system in the Highlands, and the substitution in its stead of large sheep farms; the comparative want of poor-laws; and the obstacles interposed by the law of Scotland to the sub-letting of farms, and to the subdivision of land. But however it may be accounted for, the fact is certain that, as compared with the increase of wealth, the population of Scotland has increased less rapidly than that of either of the two sister kingdoms. The Scotch have therefore advanced much more rapidly than the English or Irish in wealth, and in the command of the necessaries and conveniences of life. Their progress in this respect has, indeed, been quite astonishing. The habits, diet, dress, and other accommodations of the people, have been signally improved. It is not too much to affirm, that the peasantry of the present day are better lodged, better clothed, and better fed, than the middle class of landowners were a century ago.

It appeared from a previous table, that the entire popu-the subsequent ten years. But it is evident from the prelation of Scotland had increased sixteen per cent. during ceding table, that the increase in the population of the larger the ten years ending in 1821, and thirteen per cent. during towns is considerably greater during the same periods, being[7:19:768] 26 ¼ and 26 1 / 2 per cent. respectively. The advance of Glasgow, in particular, has exceeded that of any of the large towns in the empire, not even excepting London, Manchester, and Liverpool, having been 33 per cent. for the tcn years ending in 1821, and 37 per cent. for the subsequent ten years.^[62. Babbage’s Economy of Manufactures, p. 5.]

But the great prosperity and advancement which Scotland has undergone, is best proved by the state of her public revenue.^[63. ’ Chalmers’s Historical View, p. 387.]

The revenue of Scotland at the union, including taxes then imposed, L.l60,000

And her met revenue for the year 1804, 1,934,276

Ditto for 1813, including the property-tax, and other war taxes, 4,155,599

Revenue for 1822, the property-tax, &c. having been repealed, 3,436,642

Ditto for 1836 4,592,797

Ditto for 1838 4,692,724

Thus not only has the revenue of Scotland risen from L.l60,000 to L.4,692,724 since the Union, or is now twenty-nine times greater than it then was, but the people are undoubtedly now more able to pay the larger sum than they formerly were to contribute the smaller.

The following table, illustrative of the state of Scottish shipping at different periods, bears also unequivocal testimony to the great prosperity and advancement of Scotland.^[64. Chalmers, ut supra, p. 390; Macpherson's Annale of Commerce, anno 1760; M'Culloch's Statistical Account, vol. xi. sect. Commeret.]

The first boat successfully impelled by steam in Europe was the Comet, which began to ply on the Clyde in 1812, and was the result of the skill and ingenuity of the late Henry Bell. Nor was there more than one steam-boat in Scotland for two years afterwards. In 1819, they had increased to 11; in 1830, to 61; and in 1837, to 109, (tonnage, 13,368), of which 63, or considerably more than the half, belonged to the Clyde.^[65. The Steam Engine, by Hugo Reid, Edinburgh, 1838, p. 160.] The following table shews the rapidly increasing number and tonnage of the steamboats which entered the different ports of Scotland, and cleared out, at different periods, since 1820.

On the subject of the Scottish manufactures our notices, derived from official or other documents, shall be brief, particularly as under the articles Dundee, Glasgow, &c., we have already given pretty ample information on the different manufactures for which the country is distinguished. The linen manufacture was the earliest, and long regarded as the staple, branch of industry carried on in Scotland. But such were the narrow limits within which it was confined, that, at the Union, in 1707, it was not supposed to exceed 1,500,000 yards a-year. In 1727, aboard of trustees was established for the superintendence and encouragement of the linen manufacture; and bounties and premiums were given on its production and exportation.

The regulations as to the inspection and stamping of the linen intended for exportation, by which the trade was much annoyed, were abolished in 1822; and the bounties ceased in the year 1830. The quantity produced for sale in 1728 was 2,000,000 yards; in 1775, 12,000,000 yards; in 1822, 36,000,000 yards; and the exports alone, in 1835, exclusive of home consumption, was between 60,000,000 and 70,000,000 yards, worth about L.l,600,000. Dundee and the east of Scotland, including Fifeshire, are the great seats of the manufacture, particularly in Osnaburghs, sail-cloth, and the coarser fabrics; and Dunfermline and the neighbouring towns and villages, the principal seat of damask, diaper, and the finer fabrics. Previously to 1791, all the yarn used in the manufacture was spun upon the common hand-wheel; but the spinning by machinery began at that time to be introduced; and such has been the facility of production consequent on the erection of flax-mills, that the cost of the yarn, including the raw material, is now less than the spinning amounted to thirty years ago. The number of flax, hemp, and tow factories was, in 1837, 175, employing no fewer than 15,462 workers, of whom 4231 were between thirteen and eighteen years of age, and 163 between nine and thirteen.

Lanarkshire, which includes the city of Glasgow, and also the contiguous county of Renfrew, has always been the principal seat of the cotton manufacture. Some of the fabrics made at Glasgow and Paisley are of almost unrivalled beauty and fineness. The first steam-engine for the spinning of cotton erected in Scotland, was constructed so late as 1792. The number of cotton factories in 1837 was 177, all those of considerable size being situated at Glasgow, and in the neighbouring districts, comprehending twenty or thirty miles around Glasgow, excepting five in Aberdeenshire, two in Perthshire, one in Dumfries-shire, and one at Gatehouse, in Kirkcudbrightshire. But, with no exception, all these country mills are connected with Glasgow houses, or the Glasgow trade, at least so far as the raw material is concerned. The number of hands from eight years of age upwards employed in the Scottish cotton manufacture, is 34,418, of whom 13,567 are between thirteen and eighteen years of age, and 1096 between nine and thirteen.

The woollen manufacture of Scotland has never been considerable. It was formerly the custom for the occupiers of land in this country to spin the whole of their wool with the hand in their own houses, and to send the yarn to the village weaver to be woven into a species of coarse cloth called plaiding; but this mode, which is indicative of a rude and backward state of society, is now entirely abandoned, having been superseded by machinery. Factories for the making of fine cloth have been established in Aberdeenshire, and in some other counties; but comparatively coarse fabrics still continue to be the staple article of Scotch manufacture. The number of woollen or worsted factories in 1837 was 104, situated chiefly at Aberdeen, in Clackmannanshire, at Hawick, Galashiels, and Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, and in the counties of Stirling, Argyle, and Inverness. Hawick has almost entirely withdrawn from this species of manufacture, and devotes its energies principally to the production of woollen hose, of which it annually produces about 500,000 pairs, with blankets, and flannels. The towns of Stirling and Bannockburn are almost the exclusive seat of tartans. Kilmarnock is chiefly celebrated for its manufacture of carpets and shawls, besides large numbers of night-caps, bonnets, and foraging caps for the army. Bonnets in Scotland, however, have been pretty generally superseded by hats. The woollen factories, in 1837, contained 4339 workers, of whom 1856 were between thirteen and eighteen years of age, and 156 between nine and thirteen.[7:19:769] The silk manufacture in Scotland is still less considerable than that of woollen. The principal seats of it are at Paisley, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. Broad silks, or manufactured goods of entire silk, sold by the yard, viz. gauzes, Persians, satins, and, in general, all broad silks, plain or figured, are made at these places, particularly the two first. Silk mills were established in Edinburgh so late as the year 1838. Handkerchiefs, such as Bandanas and Barcelonas, are made at Paisley and Glasgow, and a few adjacent places in connexion with these towns. Paisley is celebrated for “mixed goods,” that is, all varieties of manufacture in which silk forms a component part. Edinburgh is eminent chiefly for its shawls of the finest fabrics, but perhaps is surpassed even in this its staple silk production by Paisley. The silk factories contain about 1000 workers. The whole of the factories, of all kinds, in Scotland, namely, those of linen, cotton, woollen, and silk, amounted, in 1837, to 462, (of which 102 are situated in Lanarkshire, 94 in Forfarshire, including Dundee, Arbroath, and other manufacturing towns, and 62 in Renfrewshire,) employing 55,159 persons; but the number of both has increased considerably since that time.

Soap has long been manufactured to a very great extent in Scotland; and the principal seats of the manufacture are Glasgow, Leith, Paisley, Aberdeen, Prestonpans, and Montrose. The quantity made, in 1837, was 12,958,856 lbs., viz. of hard soap, 9,553,855, and of soft, 3,4050,01. The quantity exported was 450,956 lbs., the rest being retained or home consumption. The number of licences issued to soapmakers was twenty-one.

The quantity of whisky produced in Scotland cannot be ascertained before the year 1823, because, previously to that time, owing to the high rate of duty, (5s. 6d. per English wine gallon,) smuggling prevailed to a great extent in almost every district of the country, particularly in the Highlands. But in 1823 the duty was reduced to 2s., though subsequently, namely, in 1826 and 1830, it has been successively raised to 2s. 10d. and 3s. 4d. The following table will shew the quantity that paid duty for home consumption since that time:
[table]

This is exclusive of the quantity produced for the foreign market. In 1838 there were exported to England, at a duty of 7s. 6d. per gallon, 2,215,329 gallons; and to Ireland, at a duty of 2s. 4d., 861,069 gallons.

The principal seat of this manufacture is Edinburgh and its neighbourhood; but it prevails extensively in other places. By the following statement it appears that the quantity of strong ale brewed on an average of five years previous to 1830, was 119,551 barrels annually, (the duty being 9s. 10d. per barrel,) and of table beer, on an average of the same time, 250,698 barrels, the duty being 1s. 11 ½ d. But the duty being repealed in 1830, there are no later accounts of the quantity breweιl. The duty on malt is 20s. 8d. per quarter, and on hops 2d. per lb. The following table gives the number of brewers in Scotland in 1833 and 1834.

The manufacture of kelp, which was formed by the incineration of the common sea-wrack, has altogether ceased; but during the late war it was prosecuted to such an extent, particularly on the shores of the Highlands and Islands, that the total amount produced in Scotland was about 20,000 tons, which usually brought about L.10 per ton, or L.200,000 yearly. At some periods it brought L.20, at others it was as low as L.4 per ton. But since the reduction of the duty on barilla and salt, the manufacture has altogether ceased.

Scotland has long been famous for its fisheries, which were fora time the subject of bounties and premiums on the part of government; but it is questionable whether such factitious encouragement was productive of any real or permanent good. Boards for protecting, extending, and encouraging the fisheries were instituted in 1749, 1786, and 1808. But all bounties and premiums have now ceased; and the branch of industry in question is now thriving at least as well as when encumbered with factitious aid. The salmon fishery of Scotland has long been very considerable. The fishery in the Tweed is the most important, not only in Scotland, but in the empire, though there has of late years been a great decline in the quantity caught. About the end of the late war, the Tweed fishery yielded a rental of from L.15,000 to L.18,000 a-year; but owing to the falling off in the quantity caught, it does not now yield above L.4000 a-year. In addition to the Tweed, the other most valuable salmon fisheries are in the Forth, Tay, Dee, Don, Findhorn, Spey, Ness, Conon, and other rivers throughout Scotland. The London market is supplied with salmon chiefly by Scotland. The total value of the salmon caught in Scotland has been estimated at L.150,000 a-year.^[66. Loudon’s Encyclopedia of Agriculture. General Report of Scotland, iii. 327.] Salmon fisheries north of the Tweed and Solway, but not these rivers themselves, are to be shut from the 14th of September to the 1st of February. In the Tweed and its tributary streams, the taking of salmon with the net is prohibited between the 15th of October and 15th February, or with the rod between 7th of November and 15th February. The Solway fisheries, according to the act of Parliament, include all streams that fall into the Solway Firth, embracing the Piltanton, the Luce, and the Bladenoch in Wigtonshire; the Cree, Fleet, Dee, and Urr in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright; as well as the Nith and other rivers in Dumfries-shire. The close season with all of these rivers begins on the 25th of September, and terminates with Piltanton, Luce, Bladenoch, and Cree, as early as the 3lst of December; with the Fleet[7:19:770] and the Dee on the 1st of February; and on the Solway Firth itself, properly so called, including the Urr and the other streams that enter it, it extends to the 10th of March. The penalties for transgressing any of these regulations are heavy.^[67. Burton’s Manual of the Law of Scotland, pp. 257—60.] l The herring fishery has long been extensively cultivated, and much capital has been invested in it. The chief seat is the east of Scotland, of which Wick, and its suburb, Pultneytown, in Caithness, are important stations. Pultneytown, indeed, has, owing to this circumstance, grown up with something like the rapidity of a manufacturing village. During the fishing season, from 1500 to 2000 boats, each averaging a crew of five men, rendezvous here. Of these about 500 belong to the town; the rest resort thither from all quarters of the kingdom. Of 436,098 barrels of herring cured in the year ending the 5th of April 1834, no fewer than 134,738, or between a third and a fourth of the whole, were cured at Wick. The following table contains an account of the total number of barrels of herring which were cured in Scotland in the year just referred to, distinguishing the stations where landed or cured:
[table]

About an eighth part of the whole was cured at sea, and the remainder on shore. About the same proportion was cured ungutted; the rest were gutted, and generally within twenty-four hours after the fish were caught. In addition to the herring, the Scottish coast abounds with various kinds of white fish, such as haddock, cod, ling, and the like, as also oysters, flounders, and other flat fish. the persons who carry on the white fishing reside in the sea-ports, or the numerous villages on the coast. They use lines and nets, but principally the former; and their business can be carried on throughout the year. Steam navigation gives them a readier and a wider command of a market than they formerly enjoyed. In 1834 the herring, cod, and ling fisheries employed 9,263 boats, decked and undecked, 48,700 fishermen and boys by whom the boats were manned, 1893 coopers, and 28,645 in gutting, packing, &c; the total number of persons employed in these fisheries being 79,238.

This article would not be complete if it did not refer, however briefly, to the system of banking for which Scotland has become so celebrated. The Scottish banks are joint-stock establishments with large constituencies, the National bank having no fewer than 1238 partners, and the North of Scotland bank 1418; and, except in the case of chartered banks, each partner is responsible to the extent of his private fortune. With the chartered banks the responsibility is limited; but then the charter guarantees a certain amount of capital. For example, the capital of the bank of Scotland is L.1,500,000, for which sum the shareholders are responsible; and of it two-thirds, or L. 1,000,000, has been actually paid up. These establishments, consisting of extensive constituencies, whose responsibility is unlimited, or, if chartered, possessing large capitals paid up or guaranteed, enjoy the perfect confidence of the public. Besides, they are severally under the management of a body of Directors chosen by the partners out of their own body, and directly and periodically responsible to their constituents; and under their superintendence the banking business is carried on in these establishments on the most judicious and approved principles. Nor is this all. The different banks periodically exchange notes with each other; in Edinburgh, twice weekly, and in the country generally once a-week. Over-issuing is thus completely checked, for if any one bank has, after an exchange is made, an overplus of the notes of any other, this latter must redeem those notes either by a payment in specie, or in Exchequer bills, or an order on the bank of England. For any of these institutions to become insolvent or bankrupt seems next to be impossible. Indeed, no joint-stock bank, of any importance, ever did become insolvent; but in cases when, in provincial towns, such banks have suspended payment, (which has happened only in a very few instances, and these originating in ignorance or fraud,) the public, or the holders of their notes, have suffered no loss, each partner being responsible to the amount of his private fortune. The Scotch banks receive sums as low as L.10, or sometimes lower, as deposits, and allow interest on them at about one, or one and a half per cent. below the market rate. The system of “cash accounts” is peculiar to the Scottish mode of banking. A cash account is a credit given by a bank to an individual with two or more collateral securities, for a certain sum, which he may draw out wholly or partially as he pleases, replacing it in the same way, being charged interest only on the portion he withdraws. The act prohibiting the circulation of small notes in England did not extend to Scotland; so that the currency consists almost exclusively of papcr, namely, notes of the value of L.1 and upwards, Indeed, there is very little gold in circulation. The Scotch banks draw on London at twenty days date. The Bank of Scotland, the oldest banking establishment in Scotland, was established in 1695, and issued notes for L.1 as early as 1704. The Royal Bank of Scotland was founded in 1727 and the British Linen Company in 1746. The total number of joint-stock banks at present in Scotland is 25, having altogether 306 branches. There are also seven private banking establishments. The aggregate amount of the sums deposited in the different Scottish banks was calculated to be in 1826 about L.20,000,000 or L.21,000,000; and it must have since increased considerably. The circulatior is supposed to be between L.3,000,000 and L.4,000,000 seldom exceeding the latter sum.^[68. House of Commons’ Report of 1826, on Scottish and Irish Banks.]
