SAMARIA, in Ancient Geography, one of the three larger Cisjordan districts, situated in the middle between Galilee to the north and Judaea to the south, beginning at the village Ginaea, in the Campus Magnus, and ending at the toparchy called Acrobatena. Its soil differs in nothing from that of Judaea, both being equally hilly and champaign, and both equally fertile in corn and fruit. It is called the kingdom of Samaria in Ephraim, comprehending the ten tribes, and consequently all the country to the north of Judaea and east and west of Jordan.

SamarIA, the capital city of the kingdom of Samaria, or of the ten tribes. It was built by Omri king of Israel, who began to reign in the year of the world 3079, and died 3086.
