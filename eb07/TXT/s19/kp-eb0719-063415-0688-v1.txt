It is situated in a barren and stony valley amidst lofty hills, and is surrounded in its immediate vicinity with fine gardens and luxuriant woods. It contains many handsome stone houses, and others substantially built of brick, and is said by Sir Henry Middleton to be somewhat larger than Bristol, in space at least, if not in population. It is defended by a strong mud-wall. Fruits are plentiful in the neighbourhood. It is 128 miles north-north-east of Mocha. Long. 44. 9. E. Lat. 15. 21. N.
