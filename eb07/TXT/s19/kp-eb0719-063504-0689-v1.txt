SANCHEZ, François, called in Latin Sanctius, was a native of Las Brocas, in Spain, and has been dignified by his own countrymen with the pompous titles of father of the Latin language and doctor of all kinds of letters. He wrote, 1. An excellent treatise entitled Minerva, or Be causis Linguae Latinae, which was published at Amsterdam in 1714, in 8vo; 2. The Art of Speaking and the Method of translating Authors; 3. Several other learned pieces on grammar. He died in the year 1600, in his seventy-seventh year.

We must be careful to distinguish this author from another François Sanchez, who died at Toulouse in 1632. This last was a Portuguese physician, who settled at Toulouse, and, though a Christian, was born of Jewish parents.

He is said to have been a man of genius, and a philosopher. His works have been collected under the title of Opera Medica. They were printed at Toulouse in 1636.
