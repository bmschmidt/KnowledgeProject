XULLA Islands, four islands in the Eastern Seas. The most considerable of them is Xulla Bessey, which is about eleven leagues in length, in good cultivation, and well inhabited. This island abounds with wax and honey. There is a village adjacent to the south-east point, where the Dutch have a fort, and where ships may procure refreshments. These islands are situated to the south-east of the Molucca passage. They are occasionally invaded by tire [7:21:957] Papuas from New Guinea, though the distance is nearly 300 miles. A settlement was formed by the English on one of these islands; but they were induced to abandon it, from the badness of the soil, and other circumstances, and to remove to the coast of Borneo.
