XIMO, or Kiusiu, an island of Japan, second in magnitude to Niphon, being upwards of 200 miles in length, about 150 in breadth, and containing many excellent harbours and flourishing cities. Europeans are rigorously excluded from all intercourse with this island, with the exception of the Dutch, who are still allowed to send their annual vessel to Nangasaki. Near the coast is the city of Firando, where the Portuguese at one time had an establishment, but from which they are now entirely banished. In other respects, Ximo is very little known to Europeans.
