XICOCO, or Sikokf, an island, the smallest of the three that compose the empire of Japan. In length it is 100 miles, and sixty in breadth. It is only separated by narrow straits from the island of Niphon on the one side, and Ximo on the other. This island is almost entirely unknown to Europeans, as they are rigorously prohibited from all intercourse with the Japanese empire.
