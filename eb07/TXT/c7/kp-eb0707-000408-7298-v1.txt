CLYDE, a large river of Scotland, formed by a concentration of a number of rivulets rising amidst the mountains and wastes which separate Lanarkshire from the counties of Peebles and Dumfries. This river is the third in point of magnitude in Scotland, but the most useful for commerce. From its source it pursues a northerly course, and after being joined by a number of tributaries, and flowing for nearly an hundred miles, it discharges itself into the broad expanse of the Atlantic, through the great estuary called the Frith of Clyde. Some of the numerous cataracts which it forms in its progress to the ocean, particularly those of Corra Linn and Stonebyres, are considered as among the finest of the kind in Great Britain. It is navigable for small vessels up to Glasgow. The canal which connects it with the Forth falls into the Clyde ten miles below that city.
