CUPID, in Pagan mythology, the god of love. There seems to have been two Cupids; one the son of Jupiter and Venus, whose delight it was to raise sentiments of love and virtue; and the other the son of Mars and the same goddess, who inspired wanton and impure desires. The first of these, called Eros, or true love, carried golden arrows, which caused real joy, and a virtuous affection; the other, called Anteros, had leaden arrows, which raised a passion founded only on dcsire, and which ended in satiety and disgust. Cupid was always drawn with wings, to represent his inconstancy, and in a state of nudity, to show that he had nothing of his own. He was painted blind, to denote that love sees no fault in the object beloved; and with a bow and quiver of arrows, to denote his power over the mind. Sometimes he was placed between Hercules and Mercury, to show the prevalence of eloquence and valour in love; sometimes he was placed near Fortune, to signify that the success of lovers depends on that inconstant goddess. He was also represented with a helmet on his head and with a spear on his shoulder, to indicate that love disarms the fiercest men; and as riding upon the backs of panthers and lions, and using their manes for a bridle, to denote that love tames the most savage beasts. He was likewise pictured riding upon a dolphin, to signify that his empire extends over the sea as well as the land.
