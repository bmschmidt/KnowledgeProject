CURRAH, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Allahabad. It has a fertile soil, which, when well watered, yields all sorts of grain, also sugar-cane, cotton, tobacco, and a species of earth impregnated with alkali, which is used as soap. Its capital is of the same name; it is situated on the south-western bank of the Ganges, and extends above a mile on the bank of the river, and about half a mile inland. On the banks of the Ganges, and in the middle of the town, stands an old fort, in the vicinity of which are several Hindu temples. â€™The governor of the province formerly resided at Currah; but being removed by the Emperor Acbar, the town has since decayed. It is forty-five miles north-west from Allahabad. Long. 81. 24. E. Lat. 25. 4L N.
