CORYPHAeUS, in the ancient tragedy, was the ehief or leader of the company who composed the chorus. The word is formed from the Greek κogupτj, the top of the head. Whenever the ehorus took part in the action, the eory-phaeus spoke for all the rest, in quality of a person of the drama, during the course of the acts. Hence coryphaeus passed into a general name for the chief or principal of any company, corporation, sect, or opinion. Thus Eustatius of Antioeh is called the coryphaeus of the council of Niee; and Cicero calls Zeno the coryphaeus of the Stoies.
