COOPANG, a town of the island of Timor, situated in a bay which forms an excellent harbour for shipping. This settlement was formed in 1630, and is now the only one in the island which the Dutch still retain. They have a fortified factory, which is placed close to the sea, with a Chinese village in the neighbourhood. A trifling commerce was formerly carried on with Batavia, from which place are imported piece goods, corn, cutlery, and opium. The returns consist of stones, sandal-wood, wax, and a little gold.
