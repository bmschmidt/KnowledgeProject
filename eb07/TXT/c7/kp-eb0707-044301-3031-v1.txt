CRAIL, a parish town and royal burgh of Scotland, in the county of Fife, about ten miles south-east of St Andrews. It is said to have been a town of some note as early as the ninth century. David I. had a palace here, now entirely demolished, except a fragment of a wall. It received from Robert Bruce the charter which constituted [7:7:444] it a royal burgh. It was anciently the seat of a priory, the ruins of which are still to be seen below the east end of the town. Many of the houses of Crail are of that massive and antique description which indicate past splendour. The church is of great antiquity. The principal street is spacious and regular. With considerable capabilities as a port, the harbour is small and incommodious, and at present possesses little or no trade. The population amounted in 1831 to 1854.
