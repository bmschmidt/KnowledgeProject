COLDSTREAM, a town of Scotland, in Berwickshire, situated upon the north bank of the Tweed. It is an irregularly-built but thriving town, the chief thoroughfare from Edinburgh to Newcastle and other parts in that direction passing through it. The Tweed is here crossed by a strong bridge of five arches. Coldstream is nearly nine miles east from Kelso, and fourteen west from Berwick. The population of the town and parish amounted in 1821 to 2675.
