CUTTER, a small vessel, commonly navigated in the English Channel. It is furnished with one mast, and rigged as a sloop. Many of these vessels are used in an illicit trade, while others arc employed by government to take them, and either under the direction of the admiralty or that of the custom-house.

Cutter is also a small boat used by ships of war.
