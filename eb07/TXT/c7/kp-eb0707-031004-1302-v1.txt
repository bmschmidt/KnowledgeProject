COPIATA, under the western empire, a grave-digger. In the first ages of the church there were clerks destined for this employment. In the year 357, Constantine made a law in favour of the priests copiatae, or of those who had the care of interments, exempting them from the lustral contribution, which all other traders paid. It was under him also that they first began to be called copiatae, or clerks destined for bodily labour, from κcσcς, or κcσω, scindo, caedo, ferio, I cut, I beat, &c. Before that time they were ealled decani and lecticarii; probably because they were divided into decades or tens, eaeh of whieh had a bier or litter for the carriage of dead bodies. Their place among the clerks was the next in order before the chanters.
