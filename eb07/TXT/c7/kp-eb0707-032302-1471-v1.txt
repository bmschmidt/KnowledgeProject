CORDELIER, a Franciscan, or religious person of the order of St Francis. The Cordeliers were clothed in thick gray cloth, with a little cowl, a chaperon, and a cloak of the same stuff, and they had a girdle of rope or cord tied with three knots; and hence the name. They are otherwise called Minor Friars, which was their original denomination. The name of Cordelier is said to have been first given them in the war of St Louis against the infidels, in which the Minor Friars having repulsed the barbarians, the king inquired their name, when it was answered, they were people cordeliez, or tied with ropes. The Cordeliers are to a man professed Scotists.
