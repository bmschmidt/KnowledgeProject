COCCOLITE, in Mineralogy, a green-coloured variety of hornblende, which generally occurs massive, or in concretions so loosely aggregated as to admit of being separated by the fingers. It fuses with difficulty before the blowpipe, and has a specific gravity of 3âˆ™3. It occurs with garnet and granular limestone in the iron mines of Arendal in Norway, at Pargas in Finland, and elsewhere.
