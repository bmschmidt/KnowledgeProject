CORSNED, or Morsel of Execration, a species of trial or purgation anciently in use among us, and which probably arose from an abuse of revelation in the dark ages of superstition. It consisted of a piece of cheese or bread, about an ounce in weight, which was consecrated with a form of exorcism; praying the Almighty that it might cause convulsions and paleness, and find no passage, if the man was really guilty, but might turn to health and nourishment if he was innocent; as the water of jealousy among the Jews was to cause the belly to swell and the thigh to rot, if the woman was guilty of adultery. This corsned was then given to the .suspected person, who at the same time also received the holy sacrament, if indeed the corsned was not, as some have suspected, the sacramental bread itself; till the subsequent invention of transubstantiation preserved it from profane uses. Our historians assure us that Godwin earl of Kent, in the reign of King Edward the Confessor, abjuring the death of the king’s brother, at last appealed to his corsned, per buccellam dcglutiendam abjuravit, which stuck in his throat and killed him. This custom has been long since gradually abolished, though the remembrance of it still subsists in certain phrases of abjuration retained among the common people: as, “I will take the sacrament upon it !” “May this morsel be my last !” and the like.
