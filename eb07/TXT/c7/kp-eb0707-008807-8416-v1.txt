COLLYRIDIANS, in church history, a sect, towards the close of the fourth century, denominated from a little cake, called by the Greeks %oλλυg∕δ∕α, coUyridia, which they offered to the Virgin Mary. This sect, it seems, consisted chiefly of Arabian women, who, out of an extravagant devotion to the Virgin, met on a certain day in the year to celebrate a solemn feast, and to render divine honours to Mary as to a goddess, eating the cake which they offered in her name. St Epiphanius, who relates the history of this superstitious cermony, ridicules it.
