COTYS, a name common to several kings of Thrace, of Cappadocia, and of the Cimmerian Bosphorus. The most ancient of these was Cotys, king of Thrace, who, about the year 600 b. c. permitted Alyattes, king of Lydia, to carry a colony of Mysians. The kings of this family called themselves descendants of Eumolpus; and hence they always preserved an intimate connection with the Athenians, who granted to several of them the title of citizen. Cotys I. was the son of Pentheus, became king of a portion of Thrace about the year 380, and was assassinated in 356 B. c. Of Cotys II. little or nothing is known. Cotys III. was the son of Sadales, and reigned over the Odryses about the year b. c. 57. Two other princes bore the same name, and also a king of the Lesser Armenia, who was son of Cotys V.
