COUNTRY, among geographers, is used indifferently to denote either a kingdom, province, or lesser district. But its most frequent use is in contradistinction to town.

Country- Dance is of English origin, though now transplanted into almost all the countries and courts of Europe. There is no established rule for the composition of tunes to thÎ“s dance, because there is in music no kind of time whatever which may not be measured by the motions common in dancing; and there are few song tunes of any note within the last century which have not been applied to country dances.
