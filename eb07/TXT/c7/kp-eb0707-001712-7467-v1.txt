COENOBITE, a religious person who lives in a convent, or in community, under a certain rule; in opposition to anchoret or hermit, who lives in solitude. The word comes from the Greek %o∕voς, communis, and βιos, vita, life. Cassian makes this difference between a convent and a monastery, that the latter may be applied to the residence of a single religious person or recluse, whereas the convent implies coenobites, or numbers of religious living in common. Fleury speaks of three kinds of monks in Egypt; anchorets, who lived in solitude; coenobites, who continued to live in community; and sarrabaites, who were a kind of monks-errant, strolling from place to place. He refers the institution of coenobites to the times of the apostles, and makes it a kind of imitation of the ordinary lives of the faithful at Jerusalem. But St Pachomius is ordinarily owned the institutor of the coenobite life, as being the first who gave a rule to any community.
