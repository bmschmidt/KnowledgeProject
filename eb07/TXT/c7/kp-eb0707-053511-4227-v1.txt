CUMAe, in Ancient Geography, a city of Campania, near Puteoli, supposed to have been founded by a colony from Chalcis and Cumae of Aeolia before the Trojan war. The inhabitants were called Cumaei ; and one of the Sibyls having fixed her residence in a cave in the neighbourhood, was called the Curnean Sibyl.
