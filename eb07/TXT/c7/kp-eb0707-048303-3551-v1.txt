CROXAL, Samuel, an ingenious English divine, who in his youth wrote the poem entitled the Fair Circassian. He had the livings of Hampton in Middlesex, and the united parishes of St Mary Somerset and St Mary Mounthaw in London, both of which he held till his death in 1751. He published many other poems and translations, besides an English edition of Aesopâ€™s Fables. In consequence of his attachment to whig principles, he enjoyed some other preferments, and was chaplain in ordinary to George II.
