COBURG. See Saxe-Coburg. Coburg, a city, the capital of the duchy of Saxe-Coburg. It stands in a pleasant and fruitful district on the river Its, and is surrounded by mountains, whose sides are covered with vines, and at whose feet are well cultivated gardens. It contains 765 houses, and, including the military, 8154 inhabitants. The ducal palace is a magnificent pile of building, which incloses the court, church, and the public library, consisting of more than 25,000 volumes, and all the state papers. . There are five other churches, and appropriate institutions for education and charity. But the manufactures are few, and the trade only such as is attracted by the markets and fairs.
