COMMEWINA, a river of South America, in Guiana, which rises in the mountains in the interior, and falls into the Surinam, about ten miles from its mouth. It is from two to four miles in breadth, but so shallow, and so full of quicksands, small islands, and rocks, as to render its navigation very difficult. On its banks are some beautiful plantations of coffee and sugar.
