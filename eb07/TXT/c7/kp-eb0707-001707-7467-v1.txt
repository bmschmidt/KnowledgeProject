CO-EFFICIENTS, in Algebra, are the numbers or known quantities which are put before letters or quantities, whether known or unknown, and into which they are supposed to be multiplied. Thus, in 3x, ax, or bx, 3, a, and b are the co-efficients of x ; and in 6a, Â§b, 6 and 9 are the co-efficients of a and b. See Algebra.
