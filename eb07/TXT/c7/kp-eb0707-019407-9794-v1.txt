COMPULSOR, an offieer under the Roman emperors, dispatched from court into the provinces, to compel the payment of taxes and imposts not paid within the time prescribed. The word is formed of the verb compellere, to oblige or constrain. These officers were charged with so many exactions, under colour of their offiee, that Honorius cashiered them by a law in 412. The laws of the Visigoths mention military conÎ¹pulsors, who were officers among the Goths: their business was to oblige the tardy soldiers to go into the fight, or to run to an attack, &c. Cassian mentions a kind of monastic compulsors, whose duty it was to declare the hours of canonical office, and to take care that the monks went to church at these hours.
