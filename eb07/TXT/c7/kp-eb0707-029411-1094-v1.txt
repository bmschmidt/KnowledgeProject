CONVOCATION, an assembly of the clergy of England, by their representatives, to consult of ecclesiastical matters. It is held during the session of parliament, and consists of an upper and a lower house. In the upper sit the bishops, and in the lower the inferior clergy, who are represented by their proctors, consisting of all the deans and archdeacons, of one proctor for every chapter, and two for the clergy of every diocese, in all one hundred and forty-three divines; namely, twenty-two deans, fifty-three archdeacons, twenty-four prebendaries, and forty-four proctors of the diocesan clergy. The lower house chooses its prolocutor, whose business it is to take care that the members attend, to collect their debates and votes, and to carry their resolutions to the upper house. The convocation is summoned by the king’s writ, directed to the archbishop of each province, requiring him to summon all bishops, deans, archdeacons, and others qualified or entitled to sit therein.

The power of the convocation is limited by a statute of Henry VIII. They are not to make any canons or ecclesiastical laws without the king’s license; nor, when permitted to make any, can they put them in execution, except under several restrictions. They have the examining and censuring all heretical and schismatical books and persons; but there lies an appeal to the king in chancery, or to his delegates. The clergy in convocation, and their servants, have the same privileges as members of parliament.

Since the year 1665, when the convocation of the clergy gave up to the House of Commons the privilege of taxing themselves, they have seldom been allowed to do any business; and are generally prorogued from time to time till dissolved, a new one being generally called along with a new parliament. The only equivalent for giving up the privilege of taxing themselves, was their being allowed to vote at elections for members to the House of Commons, w’hich they had not before.
