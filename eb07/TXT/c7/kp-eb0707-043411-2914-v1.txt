COVIN, a deceitful compact or agreement between two or more to deceive or prejudice a third person. Thus, if a tenant for life conspire with another, that this other shall recover the land which the tenant holds in prejudice of him in reversion, this is covin. Dr Skinner supposes the word to be a corruption of the Latin conventum, and therefore writes it coven.
