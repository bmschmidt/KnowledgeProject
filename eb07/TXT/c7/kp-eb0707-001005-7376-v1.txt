COCCEIUS, John, professor of theology at Bremen, was founder of a sect called Cocceians, who, amongst other singular opinions, held that of a visible reign of Christ in this world, after a general conversion of the Jews and all other people to the true Christian faith, as laid down in the voluminous works of Cocceius. He died in 1699, at the age of sixty-six.
