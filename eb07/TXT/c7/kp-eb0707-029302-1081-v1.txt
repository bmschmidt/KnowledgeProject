CONTOBABDITES, a sect which appeared in the sixth century. Their first leader was Severus of Antioch, who was succeeded by John the grammarian, surnamed Philoponus, and one Theodosius, whose followers were also called Theodosians. Part of them, who were willing to receive a book composed by Theodosius on the Trinity, formed a separate body, and were called Contobabdites, from some place, which Nicepborus does not mention, but which apparently must have been that where they held their assemblies. The Contobabdites allowed no bishops.
