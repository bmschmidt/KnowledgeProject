COTICE, or Cotise, in Heraldry, is the fourth part of the bend, which with us is seldom or never borne except in eouples, with a bend between them, whenee probably the name. It comes from the French coté, side, eotices being borne, as it were, beside the bend. A bend thus bordered is said to be cotised, coticé. Thus, it is said, he bears sable on a bend eotised argent three einquesoils.
