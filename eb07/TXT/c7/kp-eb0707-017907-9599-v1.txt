COMMUNICATING, in Theology, the act of receiving the sacrament of the eucharist. Those of the reformed and of the Greek churches communicate under both kinds; those of the Roman Catholic church under only one. The oriental communicants receive the species of wine by a spoon, and anciently they sucked it through a pipe, as hasâˆ£ been observed by Rheanus on Tertullian.

. COMMUNICATION, in a general sense, the act of imparting something to another.

Communication is also used for the connection of one thing with another, or the passage from one place to another: thus a gallery is a communication between two apartments.

Communication of motion, the act by which a body at rest is put into motion by a moving body; or it is the acceleration of motion in a body already moving.
