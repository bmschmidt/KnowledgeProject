CORPOREITY, the quality of that which is corporeal, or has body; or that which constitutes it such. The corporeity of God was the capital error of the Anthropomorphites. Some authors reproach Tertullia‚àè with admitting a corporeity in the Deity; but it is manifest that, by body, he means no more than substance. The Mahommedans reproach the Samaritans at this day with a belief in the corporeity of God. Many of the ancients believed in the corporeity of angels.
