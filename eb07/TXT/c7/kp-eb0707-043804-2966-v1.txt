COYPEL, Anthony, a French painter, born at Paris in 1661. Noyel Coypel, his father, being chosen by Μ. Colbert as director of the academy at Rome, he took his son with him into Italy, where Anthony Coypel formed himself on the works of the greatest masters; and on his return to France was appointed first painter to the Duke of Orleans. That prince employed him in painting the grand gallery of the royal palace, and allowed him a pension. In 1714 he was named director of the Academy of Painting and Sculpture. In 1715 he was made the first painter to the French king, and ennobled on account of his merit.

He died in 1722. Μ. Coypel, his son, also excelled in the same art.
