COURANT, a Freneh term synonymous with current, and properly signifying running. Sec Current. Courant is also a term in music and dancing, being used to express both the tune or air and the dance. With regard to the first, courant or currant is a piece of music in triple time; and the air of the courant is ordinarily noted in triples of minims, the parts to be repeated twice. It begins and ends when he who beats the measure falls his hands, in contradistinction to the saraband, which ordinarily ends when the band is raised. With regard to dancing, the courant was, long the most common of all the dances practised in England. It consists essentially of a time, a step, a balance, and a coupee, though it also admits of other motions. Formerly dancers leaped their steps; in which point the courant differed from the low dance and pavades. There are simple courants and figured courants, all danced by two persons.
