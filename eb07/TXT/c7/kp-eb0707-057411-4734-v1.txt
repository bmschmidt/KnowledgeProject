CYNAeGIRUS, an Athenian, celebrated for his extraordinary courage. He was the brother of the poet Aeschylus. After the battle of Marathon he pursued the flying Persians to their ships, and seized one of their vessels with his right hand, which was immediately severed by the enemy; upon which he seized the vessel with his left hand, and when he had lost that also, he still held on with his teeth.
