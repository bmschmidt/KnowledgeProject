Of these, the drachma, didrachma, <fcc.were of silver; the rest for the most part of brass. The other parts, as tridrachm, tribolus, &c. were sometimes coined.

Of these, the denarius, victoriatus, sestertius, and sometimes the as, were of silver, and the rest of brass. See As, &c. There were sometimes also coined of brass the triens, sextans, uncia, sextula, and dupondius.
