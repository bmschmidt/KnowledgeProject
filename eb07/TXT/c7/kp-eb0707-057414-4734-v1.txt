CYNEUS, of Thessaly, a scholar of Demosthenes, who flourished 275 years before Christ. Pyrrhus having a high esteem for him, sent him to Rome to solicit a peace; and so vast was his memory, that the day after his arrival he saluted all the senators and knights by name. Pyrrhus and he wrote a joint Treatise of War, which has been quoted by Cicero.
