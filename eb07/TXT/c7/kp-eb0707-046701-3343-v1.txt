CREVIER, John Baptiste Louis, was trained under the celebrated Rollin, and afterwards became professor of rhetoric in the college of Beauvais, an office which he held for more than twenty years, discharging its duties with equal zeal and success. Upon the death of his master in 1741, he undertook to complete his Roman History, and published the last eight volumes of the work. He also published other works, and proved greatly serviceable to the cause of virtue and religion, as well as to that of letters. His death happened in 1765, at a very advanced age. Besides the continuation just mentioned, he published, 1. An edition of Livius, cum notis, in six vols. 4to, 1748, and afterwards another edition, better adapted to the use of his pupils, in six vols, small 8vo; 2. Ľ Histoire des Empereurs des Romains, jusqu a Constantin, 1749, 12 vols. 12mo; 3. Histoire de l ’ Université de Paris, 7 vols. 12mo; 4. Rhétorique Françoise, a just and useful work; 5.
