COURIER (from the French courir, to run), a messenger sent post, or express, to carry dispatches.

The ancients, too, had their couriers. We meet with two kinds; first, those who ran on foot, called by the Greeks hemerodromi, or couriers of a day, regarding whom Pliny, Cornelius Nepos, and Caesar mention that some of them would run twenty, thirty, thirty-six. and in the circus even forty leagues per day; second, riding couriers (wâˆ™ sores equitantes), who changed horses as the modern couriers do. ,

Xenophon attributes the first couriers to Cyrus. Herodotus says they were very common among the Persians, and that there was nothing in the world more swift than these kind of messengers. That prinee, says Xenophon, examined how far a horse w ould go in a day, and built stables, at such distances from each other, where he lodged horses, with persons to take care of them; and at each place, he kept a person always,ready to take the packe*, mount a fresh horse, and forward it to the next stage, and thus quite through his empire.

But it does not appear that either the Greeks or Romans had any regular fixed couriers till the time of Augustus.
[7:7:433]

Under that prince they travelled in cars, though it would appear that they afterwards went on horseback. Under the western empire they were called viatores ; and under that of Constantinople cursores, whence the modern name. See Post.
