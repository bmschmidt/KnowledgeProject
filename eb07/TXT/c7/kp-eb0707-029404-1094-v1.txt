CONVERSE, in Mathematics. One proposition is called the converse of another, when, after a conclusion is drawn from something assumed in the converse proposition, that conclusion is supposed, and then the one which in the other was supposed, is now drawn as a conclusion from it. Thus when two sides of a triangle are equal, the angles under these sides are equal; and, conversely, if these angles are equal, the two sides are equal.
