CORIDOR, or Corridor, in fortification, the covertway which is formed between the fosse and palisade on the counterscarp. The word, which is derived from the Italian coridore, or the Spanish coridor i is becoming obsolete as a military term.

Coridor, in architecture, signifies a gallery or long aisle around a building, leading to several chambers, sometimes wholly inclosed, and sometimes open on one side.
