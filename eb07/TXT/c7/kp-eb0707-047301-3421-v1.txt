CRISPIN andCrispianus, two legendary saints whose festival, as marked in the calendar, is on the 25th of October. According to the legend, they were brethren, 1 born at Rome, whence they travelled to Soissons, in France, about the year 303, to propagate the Christian religion; and because they would not be chargeable to others for their maintenance, they exercised the trade of shoemakers; but the governor of the town discovering them to be Christians, ordered them to be beheaded. From this time the shoemakers made choice of these missionaries as their tutelar saints.
