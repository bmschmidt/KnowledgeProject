CULPEE, a town of Bengal, in the district of Hooghly, situated on the eastern bank of the river Hooghly. The town stands thirty-three miles below Calcutta, at the mouth of a creek which gives shelter to boats from the impetuosity of the tide, which runs there with great violence. Opposite the town is the place of anchorage for large ships which cannot get higher up the river. The shores here are a bed of mud, and the banks of the river are covered with thick jungle; and it is esteemed excessively unhealthy, on account of the swamps and woods by which it is surrounded, insomuch that a European cannot with safety sleep a night on shore. All commanders of vessels ought to prevent their crews from going on shore, and to secure them from the rain and the dew. Long. 88. 25. E. Lat. 22. 6. N.
