CYCLADES Insulae, islands anciently so called, as Pliny informs us, from the cyclus or orb in which they were situated, beginning from the promontory Geroestum in Euboea, and lying round the island Delos.

Where they are, and what is their number, is not so generally agreed. Strabo says they were at first reckoned twelve, but that many others were added; yet most of them lie to the south of Delos, and but few to the north; so that the middle or centre, ascribed to Delos, is to be taken in a loose, and not in a geometrical sense. Strabo enumerates them after Artemidorus, as follows: Helena, Ceos, Cynthus, Seriphus, Melus, Siphus, Cimolus, Prepesinthus, Olearus, Naxus, Parus, Syrus, Myconus, Tenus, Andrus, Gyarus; but he excludes from the number Prepesinthus, Olearus, and Gyarus.
