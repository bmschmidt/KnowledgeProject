COCLES, Publius Horatius, a celebrated Roman, who alone opposed the whole army of Porsenna at the head of a bridge, while his companions behind him were cutting off the communication with the opposite shore. When the bridge was destroyed, Codes, though wounded by the darts of the enemy, leapt into the Tiber, and swam across the river with his arms. A brazen statue was raised to him in the temple of Vulcan, by the consul Publicola, as a reward for his eminent services.
