CURVATURE of a Line, is the peculiar manner of its bending or flexure, by which it becomes a curve of any r form and properties. Thus the nature of the curvature of a circle is such as that every point in the periphery is equally distant from a point within, called the centre; and hence the curvature of the circle is everywhere the same. But the curvature in all other curves is continually varying.
