COMUS, in Mythology, the god of jollity or festivity. There is reason to believe he was the same with the Chamos of the Moabites, and also with Beel-Phegor, Baal-Peor, Priapus, and Bacchus. He is represented under the form of a young man with an inflamed countenance, head inclined and crowned with flowers, air drowsy, and leaning on a huntsmanâ€™s spear in his left hand, while he held an inverted torch in his right. His statue was placed at the chamber doors of new-married persons, with its pedestal crowned with flowers.
