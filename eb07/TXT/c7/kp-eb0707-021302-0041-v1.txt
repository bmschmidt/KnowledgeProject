CONFUTATION, in Rhetoric, a part of an oration, in which the orator seconds his own arguments and strengthens his cause by refuting and destroying the opposite arguments of the antagonist. This is done by denying what is apparently false, by detecting some flaw in the reasoning of the adverse party, by granting their argument, and showing its invalidity from its consequences, or retorting it upon the adversary.
