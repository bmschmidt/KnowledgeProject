CURRICULUS, in ancient writers, denotes the year or course of a year. Actum est hoc annorum Pominieae incarnationis quater quinquagenis et quinquies quinis lustris, et tribus curriculis, that is, in the year 1028; for four times fifty make two hundred, and five times two hundred make one thousand; five lustres are twenty-five years, and three curriculi are three years.
