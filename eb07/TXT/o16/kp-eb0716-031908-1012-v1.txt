It it used in contradistinction to orient. Hence the word occidental signifies any thing belonging to the west; as occidental bezoar, occidental pearl, and the like.

Occident Estival, that point of the horizon where the sun sets at midwinter, when entering the sign Capricorn.

Occident Equinoctial, that point of the horizon where the sun sets when he crosses the equinoctial, or enters the sign of Aries or of Libra.
