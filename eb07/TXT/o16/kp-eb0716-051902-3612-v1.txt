ORCHESTRION, a musical instrument invented by the Abb√© Vogler about 1789. It was a kind of portable organ, about nine feet in height, breadth, and depth. Its power was that of an organ of sixteen feet pipe, and it had a mechanism to swell or to diminish all the sounds within its compass. Another instrument of the same name, invented in 1796, by Kunz, a Bohemian, consisted of a pianoforte, combined with some organ-stops.
