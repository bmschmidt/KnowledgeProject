OMOPHAGIA, an ancient Greek festival in honour of Bacchus, surnamed Omophayo s , 'or the eater of raw flesh. This festival was observed in the same manner with the other festivals of Bacchus, in which the celebrants counterfeited madness. What was peculiar to it was, that the worshippers used to eat the entrails of goats, raw and bloody, in imitation of the god, who was supposed to have done the same thing.
