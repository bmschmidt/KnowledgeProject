ORCHILLA, or Horchilla, a small cluster of islands in the West Indies, situated not far from the coast of South America, in latitude 12. north, and longitude 65. 20. west. The largest island, which bears the form of a crescent, is very hilly on the east and west eapes, and here trees and . ’ erdure abound; but the other parts are low, and the soil, iom its flatness, is barren, and productive of very few plants. There is little fresh water, no animals exeept goats and lizards, nor does it appear to contain any permanent popu-ation. On the south-west side the shore is nearly as ιerpendicular as a wall, and the water being very deep, vessels can approach close to it without danger. Navigation is extremely difficult amongst the Orehillas; for not only are the islands separated from each other by very narrow channels, but there are a number of currents, variable, violent, and dangerous.
