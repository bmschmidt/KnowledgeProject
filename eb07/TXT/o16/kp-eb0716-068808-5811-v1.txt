OYSTER Harbour, a bay on the south-west coast of New Holland, and north part of King George the Thirdâ€™s Sound, discovered by Vancouver in 1791. Long. 118.15.E. Lat. 34. 58. S.

Oyster Island, an island situated in the Bay of Bengal, and extremely dangerous to vessels, as it rises very little above the level of the sea, and is surrounded by rocks. It abounds with small rock-oysters, which the natives of the opposite coast catch with hammers and carry to Chittagong, whence they are conveyed to Dacca and Calcutta. It is nine miles south-south-west of the north point of the Arracan River.
