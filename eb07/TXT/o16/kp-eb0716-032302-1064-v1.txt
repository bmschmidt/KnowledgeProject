ODIHAM, a market-town of the county of Hants, in the hundred of its own name, forty-two miles from London, and twenty-four from Winchester. It has a market, which is held on Saturday, and but little trade except what arises from its wharf on the Basingstoke Canal. A mile from it are the remains of an ancient castle, in which David king of Scotland is said to have been kept a prisoner. The population amounted in 1801 to 1058, in 1811 to 1104, in 1821 to 2423, and in 1831 to 2647.
