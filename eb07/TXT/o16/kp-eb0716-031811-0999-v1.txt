OBLIQUE, in Geometry, something aslant, or which deviates from the perpendicular. Thus an oblique angle is either an acute or obtuse one, that is, any angle except a right one.

Oblique Cases, in Grammar, are all the cases of nouns except the nominative.

Oblique Ascension is that point of the equinoctial which rises with the centre of the sun, or star, or any other point of the heavens, in an oblique sphere.

Oblique Circle, in the stereographic projection, is any circle which is oblique to the plane of projection.

Oblique Descension, that point of the equinoctial which sets with the centre of the sun, or star, or any other point of the heavens, in an oblique sphere.

Oblique Line, that which, falling on another line, makes oblique angles with it; that is, the one acute, and the other obtuse.

Oblique Planes, in Dialling, are those which decline from the zenith, or incline towards the horizon.

Oblique Sailing, in Navigation, is when a ship sails upon some rhumb between the four cardinal points, making an oblique angle with the meridian; in which case she continually changes both latitude and longitude.
