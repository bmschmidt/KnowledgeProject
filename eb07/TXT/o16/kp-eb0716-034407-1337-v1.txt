OPALIA, in Antiquity, feasts celebrated at Rome in honour of the goddess Ops. Varro says they were held on the 19th of December, which was one of the days of the Saturnalia. These two feasts were celebrated in the same month, because Saturn and Ops were husband and wife; but the vows offered to the goddess were made sitting on the ground.
