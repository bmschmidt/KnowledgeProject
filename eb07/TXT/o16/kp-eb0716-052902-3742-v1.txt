ORFORD, a borough and market town of the county of Suffolk, and hundred of Plomsgate. It is a part of the parish of Sudborne, though separated from it, and stands at the confluence of the river Ore and Alde, ninety miles from London.

It has a mayor, recorder, twelve burgesses, and eight portmen, and returned two members to the House of Commons till 1832, when it was disfranchised.
