ORATORIO, in Music,a. kind of sacred drama, in which the poetry is derived from some scriptural, subject, and is set to music in recitatives, airs, duetts, trios, quartetts, &c. and choruses, accompanied by an orchestra, sometimes an organ, and introduced by an instrumental overture. The origin of the oratorio is not clearly established. Amongst the most remarkable oratorios of modern times is Haydn’s “Creation.”
