ONRUST, a small island in the Eastern Ocean, on the coast of Java, and Bay of Batavia. It is nearly of a circular form, about 4800 feet in circumference. Here the Dutch had formerly fortifications and extensive works, which were destroyed by a British armament under Sir Edward Pellew, and the island is now desolate. Onrust formerly contained about 3000 inhabitants. It is nine miles north-west from Batavia.
