OVEN, a kind of domestic furnace, used for baking bread, pies, tarts, and the like. It is of a <(rcular structure, with a very low roof, well lined both on the top, bottom, and sides, with stone; and it has a small entrance in the front, fitted with a door, which being clapped to the mouth of the oven, confines the heat, whilst bread, pies, or puddings, are baking. Over this pastry-cooks have another oven built much in the same manner, which is used for such things as require a less degree of heat. Ovens are heated by burning in them dry faggots, wood, &c. till all the parts are equally hot.
