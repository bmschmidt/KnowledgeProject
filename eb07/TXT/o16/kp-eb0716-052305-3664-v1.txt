ORE, a mineral body, partly or entirely composed of some metallic substance, in the natural state in which it exists in the earth. Metallic substances are found either native, that is, pure, and uncombined with other substances, or alloyed with other metals, or combined with oxygen or sulphur, or with acids. Thus it appears that metals exist in ores in four different states; in the metallic state, when they are either pure, or combined with each other, as in the state of alloy; in the state of an oxide; combined with sulphur in the state of sulphuret; and, with acids, forming salts.
