ORCHESTRINO, a modern musical instrument, so ∣called by its inventor Poulleau. It was shaped like a piano-forte, had similar finger-keys, and its sounds were produced by the friction of a circular bow upon the strings. It imitated the tones of the violin, the viola, the violoncello, the viol d’amour, the double-bass, &e. The construction of the bow (of hair, &e.) is said to have been very curious and ingenious.
