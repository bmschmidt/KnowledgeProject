OLENUS, a Greek poet, older than Orpheus, who was a native of Xanthe, a city of Lycia. He composed several hymns, which were sung in the island of Delos upon festival days. Olenus is said to have been one of the founders of the oracle at Delphi; to have been the first who at that place filled the office of priest of Apollo; and to have given responses in verse.
