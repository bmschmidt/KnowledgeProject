OFFING, or Offin, in nautical language, that part of the sea a good distance from shore, where there is deep water, and no need of a pilot to conduct the ship. Thus, if a ship from shore be seen sailing out to seaward, they say, “she stands for the offing and if a ship, having the shore near her, have another a good way without or beyond her, towards the sea, they say, “that ship is in the offing.”
