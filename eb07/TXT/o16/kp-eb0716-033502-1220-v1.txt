OLNEY, a market-town in the hundred of Newport, in the county of Buckingham, fifty-six miles from London. It is built on the river Ouse, and consists chiefly of one long street. The only distinguished object is the parish church, a spacious building, with a spire 185 feet in height, being the most lofty of any in the county. There was formerly considerable occupation here for females in making bone lace; but it has nearly ceased, and been feebly replaced by making straw-plaiting for hats. This place was the residence of the poet Cowper, who drew much of his descriptions from the scenery around the town. There is a market on Monday, but it has much declined. The population amounted in 1801 to 2075, in 1811 to 2268, in 1821 to 2339, and in 1831 to 2418.
