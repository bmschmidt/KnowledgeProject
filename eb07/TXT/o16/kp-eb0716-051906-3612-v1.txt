ORCUS, the god of the infernal regions, was the same with Pluto, and so called from the Greek word οζχος, signifying a tomb or sepulchre; or from δpuις, an oath sworn by he river Styx. The aneients gave this name to all the dimities of the infernal regions, even to Cerberus. There was river of the same name in Thessaly, which took its rise in the marshes of the Styx, and the waters of which were so hick that they floated like oil upon the surface of the river Peneus, into whieh they discharged themselves. This probably suggested to the poets the idea of the infernal abodes, which they denominated Oreus. Oreus has been confounded with Charon. He had a temple at Rome.
