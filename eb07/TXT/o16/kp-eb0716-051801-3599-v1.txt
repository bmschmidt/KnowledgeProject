ORANGE, an arrondissement of the department of the Vaucluse, in France, extending over 406 square miles. It comprehends seven cantons, divided into fifty communes, and contains 69,443 inhabitants. The capital, a city of the same name, is the seat of a bishop, and of some courts of law. It stands on a fruitful plain, watered by the river Meyne. It has large lofty houses, with narrow and crooked streets, a cathedral, a Protestant church, two hospitals, 1540 houses, and 8874 inhabitants, who make cotton, woollen, and silk goods, besides oil, wine, brandy, madder, and paper. It is in latitude 49. 4. N., and longitude 8. 8. east. It is remarkable as the district whence the house of Nassau derived its title as prince, which it has retained without the territory. The vicinity of the city exhibits many curious remains of Roman antiquity, especially a triumphal gate of three arches, half a mile from it, on a theatre, the walls of which are 108 feet in height. A part of this building has of late years been converted into a prison.
