MART, a great fair held every year, for buying and selling goods. Public marts, or places of buying and selling, such as markets and fairs, with the tolls there levied, can only be set up by virtue of the kingâ€™s grant, or by immemorial usage and prescription, which presupposes such a grant. The limitation of these public resorts to such time and place as may be most convenient for the neighbourhood, forms a part of economics, or domestic polity, which, considering the kingdom as a large family, and the king as the master of it, he has clearly a right to dispose and order as he pleases.
