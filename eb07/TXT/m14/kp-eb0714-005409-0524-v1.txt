MALDON, a town of the hundred of Dengey, in the county of Essex, thirty-seven miles from London. It stands in a low but pleasant district, upon the river Blackwater, at the spot where another river joins it, and where they form a harbour for small vessels. In the former of these rivers many oysters are taken and sent to the London markets. It is an ancient corporate town, and, by the corporation reform law of 1835, chooses four aidermen and twelve councillors, and a justice of the peace. It returns two members, and has about 740 electors. In this town the custom known by the name of boroÏ…gh-english still exists, the land descending to the youngest son. There is a good market for corn on Saturdays. The population, within the limits of the borough, amounted in 1801 to 2358, in 1811 to 2679, in 1821 to 3198, and in 1831 to 3831.
