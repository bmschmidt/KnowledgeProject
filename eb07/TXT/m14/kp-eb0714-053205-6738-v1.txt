MEDUSA, in fabulous history, one of the three Gorgons, and daughter of Phoreys and Ceto. She was the only one of the Gorgons who was subj eet to mortality; and she was celebrated for her personal eharms and the beauty of her loeks. Neptune beeame enamoured of her, and obtained her favours in the temple of Minerva. But this violation of the sanctity of the edifice provoked Minerva, and she ehanged the beautiful loeks of Medusa, whieh had inspired Neptune’s love, into serpents, the sight of which turned the beholders into stone s; Perseus, however, armed with Mercury’s axe,with whieh he killed Argus, eut off' Medusa’s head, from the blood of whieh sprang Pegasus and Chrysaor, together with the innumerable serpents that infest Africa. The conqueror plaeed Medusa’s head on the aegis of Minerva, whieh he had used in his expedition; and the head still retained the same petrifying powers as before.
