MAH Inductio, an ancient custom, in obedience to which the priest and people of country villages went in procession to some adjoining wood on a May-day morning, and then returned in a kind of triumph, with a May-pole, boughs, flowers, garlands, and other tokens of the spring. This May-game, or rejoicing at the coming of the spring, was for a long time observed, and still is. so, in some parts of England; but there was thought to be so much heathen vanity in it, that it was condemned and prohibited within the diocese of Lincoln by the good old Bishop GrostÃªte or Greathead.
