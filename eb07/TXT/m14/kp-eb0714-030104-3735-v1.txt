MASRAKITHA, a pneumatic instrument of music amongst the ancient Hebrews, being composed of pipes of various sizes, fitted into a kind of wooden chest, open at the top, and stopped at the bottom with wood covered with a skin. Wind was conveyed to it from the lips, by means of a pipe fixed to the chest; the pipes were of lengths musically proportioned to each other; and the melody was varied at pleasure by stopping and unstopping with the fingers the apertures at the upper extremity.
