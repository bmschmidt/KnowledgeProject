MARYPORT, a market-town and sea-port of the county of Cumberland, in the parish of Cross-Cannonby, Allerđale-ward, below Darwent, thirty miles south-west by west from Carlisle, and 309∣ north-west by north from London. It is situated at the foot of the river Ellen, and is irregularly built, partly on the sea-shore and partly on the cliff; but the streets are spacious and the atmosphere healthy. The export to Scotland, Ireland, and other places, of the coal, limestone, and red freestone worked in its neighbourhood, constitute the principal trade of the port; and the manufactures of the town consist chiefly of cotton and linen checks, sail-cloth, cables, coarse earthenware, leather, nails, and anchors. The population amounted in 1831 to 3877.
