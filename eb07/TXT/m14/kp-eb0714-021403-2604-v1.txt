MANAH, a town of Northern Hindustan, in the district of Serinagur, on the north-eastern frontier. It contains 150 or 200 houses, with from fourteen to fifteen hundred inhabitants, who are above the middle size, stout, and well formed, and seem to be of a race between those of Tartary and Hindustan. The houses are two stories in height, and constructed of stone covered with small deal planks. During the winters, which are very severe, the inhabitants emigrate to the south. A considerable trade is carried on between this place and Lahdack, by means of sheep and goats, which are accustomed to the bad roads on the mountains. They import saffron, borax, gold-dust, musk, &c. and export Benares manufactures, and a few light European articles. Long. 79.40. E. Lat. 32. 20. N.
