MAUR, St, was a celebrated disciple of St Benedict. If we can believe a life of St Maur ascribed to Faustus his companion, he was sent by Benedict on a mission to France. But this life is considered as apocryphal. In rejecting it, however, as well as the circumstances of the mission, we must beware of denying the mission itself. It is certain that it was believed in France as early as the ninth century; and notwithstanding the silence of Bede, Gregory of Tours, and others, there are several documents which prove this, or at least render it extremely probable. A celebrated society of Benedictines took the name of St Maur in the beginning of the seventeenth century, and received the sanction of Pope Gregory XV. in 1621. This society was early distinguished by the virtue and the learning of its members, and has produced many works which are deservedly held in high estimation for their great and varied erudition. See Ľ Histoire Littéraire de lα Congregation de St Maur, published by Dorn Tassin at Paris under the name of Brussels, 1770, in 4to.
