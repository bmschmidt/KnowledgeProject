MARKLAND, Jeremiah, one of the most learned scholars and acute critics of his age, was born in 1692, and received his education in Christ’s Hospital. He became first publicly known by his Epistola Critica, addressed to Bishop Hare. In this he gave many proofs of extensive erudition and critical sagacity. He afterwards published an edition of Statius, and some plays of Euripides; and he assisted Dr Taylor in his editions of Lysias and Demosthenes, by the notes which he communicated to him. He also very happily elucidated some passages in the New Testament, which may be found in Mr Boyer’s edition of it; and he was author of a volume of valuable remarks on the epistles of Cicero to Brutus, and of an excellent little treatise under the title of Questio Grammatica. He died in 1775, at Milton, near Dorking, in Surrey; and was a man not more valued for his universal reading, than beloved for the excellency of his heart and the primitive simplicity of his manners.
