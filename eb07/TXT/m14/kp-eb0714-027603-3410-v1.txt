MASCULINE, something belonging to the male, or the stronger of the two sexes.

Masculine is used in grammar to signify the first and worthiest of the genders of nouns. The masculine gender is that which belongs to the male kind, or something analogous to it. Most substances are ranged under the heads of masculine or feminine. In some cases this is done with a show of reason; but in others it is merely arbitrary, and is found to vary according to the languages, and even according to the words introduced from one language into another. Thus the names of trees are generally feminine in Latin and masculine in the Freneh. Further, the genders of the same word are sometimes varied in the same language. Thus alvus, according to Priscian, was anciently masculine, but is now feminine; and navire, a ship, in French, was anciently feminine, but is now masculine.

Masculine Signs. Astrologers divide the signs into masculine and feminine, by reason of their qualities, which are either active, hot and eold, aeeounted masculine; or passive, dry and moist, which are feminine. Upon this principle they eall the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars, maseuline; and the Moon and Venus feminine. Mercury, they suppose, partakes of both characters. Amongst the signs, Aries, Libra, Gemini, Leo, Sagittarius, and Aquarius, are masculine; Cancer, Capricornus, Taurus, Virgo, Scorpio, and Pisces, are feminine.
