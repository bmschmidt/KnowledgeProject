MARCHES (marchiÎ±), from the German march, or limes, or from the French marque, the distinction between two countries or territories, are the limits between England and Wales, or between England and Scotland, which last are divided into the west and middle marches (4 Hen. V. c. 7; 22 Ed. IV. c. 8; 24 Hen. VIII. c. 9). There was formerly a court called the Court of the Marches of Wales, where pleas of debt or damages, not above the value of L.50, were tried and determined.
