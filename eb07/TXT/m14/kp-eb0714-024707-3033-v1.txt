MARIENWERDER, one of the governments into which the Prussian province of West Prussia is divided. On the south-east it touches on Poland, but on the other sides it is surrounded by the other dominions of Prussia. It extends over 6936 square miles, and comprehends forty-five cities or walled places, four market-towns, 2078 villages, and 45,969 houses. The inhabitants amounted in 1826 to 436,071, having increased in the preceding ten years no less than 102,597. It is divided into thirteen circles. The capital is the city of the same name, which is finely situated on two small rivers, and connected by a canal with the river Vistula. It is a well-built town, with several good modern houses for the residences of the officers of the provincial government. It contains two Protestant churches, one very elegant, and 428 houses, with 5800 inhabitants. It has some small manufactures of linen and woollen cloth, and several considerable breweries, distilleries, and tanneries. Long. 18. 44. 35. E. Lat. 53. 43. N.
