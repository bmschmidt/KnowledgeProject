MALLING, distinguished by the name of Town-Mailing, or sometimes West Mailing, is a market-town in the county of Kent, in the hundred of Larkfield and the lathe of Aylesford. It is twenty-nine miles from London and six from Maidstone, being situated on a small stream which falls into the river Medway. In this place there was formerly a Benedictine convent, the ruins of which remain. It has a neat church, and an endowed free school. The population amounted in 1801 to 1093, in 1811 to 1154, in 1821 to 1205, and in 1831 to 1369. Within one mile of Town-Mailing is East Mailing, a large village, which in number of inhabitants somewhat exceeds that of the town, having amounted in 1801 to 1302, in 1811 to 1256, in 1821 to 1403, and in 1831 to 1543. Both these places depend chiefly on the plantations of hops, which are very numerous and extensive.
