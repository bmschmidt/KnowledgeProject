MASCAT, or Muscat, a sea-port of Arabia, which has the best harbour, indeed almost the only one, on the eastern shore. This harbour is formed on the south-eastward by the Mascat Island, a ridge of rocks from 200 to 300 feet in height, which is separated from the mainland by a narrow channel capable of admitting small boats, and on the other or north-western side by a ridge of mountains projeeting into the sea. The cove, from its entranee to the interior extremity, is about a mile deep; it is open to the north and west, but is sheltered from all other winds. The anchorage is good, but the entranee is difficult. The town is built upon a small sandy beach, at the bottom of the cove of Mascat. The greater part of it consists of small and ill-built houses, and huts of date-tree leaves, of the most wretched description, hardly sufficient to give shelter from the weather, all being huddled together in the greatest eonfusion, and pervaded by narrow and crooked alleys, winding in every direction. Frazer mentions, that when he visited this place in 1821, scarcely a building was to be seen in deeent repair; they were all falling into deeay, more from bad construction than from age. The best houses are those upon the beach; that of the imaum, though built of stone and lime, is but a poor edifice. On an eminenee to the north-west side of the town is a fort, consisting of several towers, and connected by a wall, including two or three batteries of guns; and on the opposite side, above the channel between the mainland and the island of Mascat, there is another consisting of two towers, connected by a curtain pierced with two tiers of embrasures. The surrounding eminences are crowned by some smaller forts, and several of the mountains have wateh-towers planted on them. The town of Maseat, according to the most aecurate calculations, contains from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, of whom about 1000 may be Hindus from Sinde, Cutch, and Guzerat. The rest are principally Arabs and negro slaves; the latter being very numerous, and in general stout and well formed. The Hindus are ehiefly employed in mercantile affairs. The surrounding country is remarkable for its sterility, the black and naked rocks being entirely void of vegetation, excepting where, in the elefts of the roeks, the inhabitants contrive by irrigation to raise a few miserable date-trees, broad-leaved almonds, and patches of grass. Comfortable refreshments are nevertheless found by vessels touching at Mascat, with excellent water, abundance of firewood, and fruits. The bazaars are well supplied with beef, and flesh both of goats and sheep; also with poultry; and in no place is there greater variety of excellent fish. Long. 59. 15. E. Lat. 23. 38. N.
