MAHANUDDY, or the Large River, a river of Hindustan, which has its source in the province of Gundwana, though the exact spot is not known. It proceeds with a very winding course towards the Bay of Bengal, crossing the province of Orissa; in the province of Cuttack it receives the contributions of the Sollundee, the Gaintee, the Bitrunnee, the Cursan, the Bamoni, and the Co-morea. About two miles west of the town of Cuttack, the Catjoura, separating from the Mahanuddy, flows to the southward of the town; whilst the Mahanuddy bends its course to the Bay of Coojung, where it falls into the Bay of Bengal by several mouths forming a delta. Including its windings, it has a course of 500 miles.
