MENIPPEAN (Sat√¨ra Menippea), a kind of satire consisting of prose and verse intermixed. It is so called from Menippus, a Cynic philosopher, who delighted in composing satirical letters in this style. In imitation of him Varro also wrote satires under the title of Satirae Menippeae; and hence this sort of composition is also denominated Varronian satire. Amongst the moderns there is a celebrated piece under this title, which was first published in 1594, against the chiefs of the league, called also the Catholicon of Spain. It is esteemed a masterpiece for the time.
