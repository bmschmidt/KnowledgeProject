MAUNDY Thursday is the Thursday in passion week, which was called Maunday or Mandate Thursday, from the command which our Saviour gave his apostles to commemorate him in the Lordâ€™s Supper, which he instituted on that day; or from the new commandment which he gave them to love one another, after he had washed their feet as a token of his love, and also as a lesson of humility to them.
