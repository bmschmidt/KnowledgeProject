MENOLOGY, Menologium, (from μηv, month, and λοyος, discourse), is much the some as martyrology, or calendar, in the Latin. The Greek menologium is divided into the several months in the year, and contains an abridgment of the lives of the saints, with a bare enumeration of the names of those whose lives were never written. The Greeks have various menologies; and the Romans tax them with inserting divers heretics in their menologies as saints.
