UJIJI, a town in eastern Central Africa, of considerable importance, also known by the name of Kavele, is situated on the eastern shores of Lake Tanganyika, in 4° 55' S. lat. and 30° 5‘ E. long. It is the chief town on that lake, and is the centre of a brisk trade in ivory. Formerly it was a great slave-market. The town is of a straggling character, Arab houses of sun-dried bricks being mingled with native huts. The population, which fluctuates considerably, is very mixed, being composed of Arabs and the representatives of numerous Central African tribes. Ujiji has been visited by various European travellers, who have made it their headquarters, and it was here that Stanley found Livingstone, on October 28, 1871. Opinions vary as to the salubrity of its climate, but the balance of testimony appears to prove that during the greater part of the year it is very unhealthy.
