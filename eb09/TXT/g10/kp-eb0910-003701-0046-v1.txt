GALITCH, or Halicz, a town of Russia, at the head of a district in the government of Kostroma, 80 miles N.E. of Kostroma, in 57° 15' N. lat. and 42° 56' E. long., on the low south-eastern shore of Galitch Lake. Among its public building3 are a hospital, a poorhouse opened in 1855, abouΓd5 churches, and a convent of the third class. The chief occupation of the inhabitants is the manufacture of leather and gloves; and the fisheries of the lake yield about 30,000 rubles per annum, and give employment to about 400 fishermen, whose rights are secured by ancient charters. At the annual fair a considerable trade is done in woollen and cotton goods, earthenware, and miscellaneous articles. In 1860 the population was 6536; but in the St Petersburg Calendar for 1878 it is given at 5620.
