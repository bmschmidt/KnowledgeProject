GAUHÀTI, a town in Kâmrùp district, Assam, the chief town of the province, situated on the left or south bank of the Brahmaputra, lat. 26° 1Γ 18" N., long. 91° 47' 26" E. Gauhâti, which is the most populous town in the Brahmaputra valley, was the seat of the British administration of Assam up to 1874, when the headquarters were removed to Shillong in the Khâsi hills, 67 miles distant, with which it is connected by an excellent cart road. Gauliâta is an important centre of river trade, and the largest seat of commerce in Assam. A regiment of native infantry is permanently cantoned there. Two much frequented places of Hindu pilgrimage are situated in the immediate vicinity, the temple of Kâmâkhyâ on a hill 2 miles west of the town, and the rocky island of Umànânda in the mid-channel of the Brahmaputra. Population (1872), 11,492; municipal revenue, £2727.
