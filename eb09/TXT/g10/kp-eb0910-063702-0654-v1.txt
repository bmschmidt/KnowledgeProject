GLASER, Christopher, one of the minor chemists of the 17th century, concerning the details of whose life very little is known. He was a native of Basel, came to Paris, succeeded Lefebvre as demonstrator on chemistry in the Jardin du Roi, and was appointed apothecary to Louis XIV. and to the duke of Orleans. He is best known to us by his Traite de la Chymie (Paris, 1663), which gives a very favourable idea of the chemical science of his time. The little work went through some ten editions in about five-and-twenty years, and was translated into both German and English. Dumas and other writers indeed have spoken very disparagingly both of the Traite and of the author’s merits and character, but this adverse judgment appears to rest on altogether insufficient grounds. One thing very much against Glaser is his alleged connexion with the marchioness de Brinvilliers. It does not appear, however, that he had any share in the notorious poisonings beyond making the deadly substances which the marchioness and others employed in secret. He appears to have died some years before 1676. A salt (the normal sulphate of potassium) which he showed how to prepare, and the medicinal properties of which he pointed out, was named Glαseri sal polychrestum, or salt of many uses. The native sulphate is still known as glaserite.
