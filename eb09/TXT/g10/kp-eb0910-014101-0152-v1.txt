GEMSBOK {Oryx gazella, Gray), a species of antelope, abounding on the dry yet fertile plains of South Africa, where it feeds on the bulbs of water-root and other kinds of succulent vegetation, by means of which the antelopes of those regions are able to subsist without water for months together. It is a large and powerful animal, measuring about 5 feet in length and over 3 feet in height at the shoulders. Its horns, situated on the same plane with its forehead, exceed 2 feet in length, are. almost straight, and are obscurely ringed throughout their lower [9:10:142] half. The colour of the upper part of the body is a rusty grey, aud of the uuder part white, while these are separated from each other by a well-defined black baud on each side. These bands unite on the breast, and are continued as a single black band until reaching the lower jaw, when they again divide and form two transverse bands on the head, terminating at the base of the horns. The head otherwise is white, as also are the limbs, with the exception of the thighs, which are black. The striking appearance presented by this antelope is in great part due to the absence of any blending in the different colours of its body. The gemsbok avoids the woods, living on the open plains in pairs or in small groups of four or five. Possessing powerful weapons of attack in its long spear-like horns, and with ample courage to use them, this animal, especially when wounded, is a formidable antagonist both to man and to the numerous beasts of prey which are attracted to the karroos of the Cape by the presence of this and other ruminant species. It is said to defend itself not unfrequently with success against the lion. Its flesh is esteemed as a delicacy, and its hide forms a valuable leather.
