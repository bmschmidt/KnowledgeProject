GATAKER, Thomas (1574-1654), a learned English divine, was born in London in 1574, and educated at St John’s College, Cambridge. From 1601 to. 1611 he held the appointment of preacher to the society of Lincoln’s Inn, which he resigned on obtaining the rectory of Rotherhithe. In 1642 he was chosen a member of the [9:10:108] Assembly of Divines at Westminster. The parts of the Assembly’s annotations upon the Bible which were executed by him are those on Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the Lamentations. At Westminster he disapproved of the introduction of the Covenant, and declared himself in favour of Episcopacy. He was also one of the forty-seven London clergymen who disapproved of the trial of Charles I. He died in 1654. His principal works, besides some volumes of sermons, are —On the Nature and Use of Lots, 1616, a curious treatise which gave rise to much controversy; Dissertatio de Stylo Novi Testamenti, 1648; Cinnus, sive Adversaria Miscellanea, in quibus Sacroe Scmpturoe primo, deinde aliorum Scriptorum, locis aliquam multis lux redditur, 1651, to which was afterwards subjoined Adversaria Posthuma ; and his edition of Marcus Antoninus, which, according to Hallam, is the “earliest edition of any classical writer published iu England with original annotations,” and for the period at which it was written possesses remarkable merit. The best edition of his works is that published at Utrecht in 1668.
