GODALMING, a municipal borough and market-town of England, county of Surrey, is situated 32 miles S.W. of London, in a valley on the right bank of the Wey, which is navigable thence to the Thames. It consists principally of one street nearly a mile in length, on the high road between London and Portsmouth. The chief public buildings are the town-hall and market-house, Wyatâ€™s almshouses for poor men, the public hall, and the parish church, an old cruciform building, of mixed architecture, but principally Early English and Perpendicular. The church was repaired in 1840, and also in 1867. It contains a large number of old memorials. Godalming has manufactures of paper, leather, parchment, and hosiery, and some trade in corn, malt, bark, hoops, and timber. The town obtained a market from Edward I. in 1300, and was incorporated in 1575. The population in 1871 was 2444.
