GED, William (? -1749), the inventor of the art of stereotyping, was born at Edinburgh about the beginning of the 18th century. In 1725 he first put in practice the art which he had discovered; and some years later he entered into a partnership with a London capitalist, with a view to employing it on a great scale. The partnership, however, turned out very ill; and Ged, broken-hearted at his want of success, died at London, October 19, 1749. The only books which he produced by means of stereotyping were two prayer-books for the university of Cambridge, and an edition of Sallust. See Life by Nichols, 1781.
