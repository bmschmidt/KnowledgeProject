GIRGEH, Girga, or Jirjeh, a town of Upper Egypt, situated on the left bank of the Nile, about 9 miles northwest of the ancient city of Abydus. It owes its name to the Coptic monastery of St George or Girgis, and is the seat of a Coptic bishop, possesses eight mosques and a Roman Catholic monastery which ranks as the oldest in Egypt, and numbers from 8000 to 10,000 inhabitants, of whom about 500 are Christians. For a long time it was the capital of the Sa’id, but this rank is now held by Soohag. The worst enemy of Girgeh is the river, which was a quarter of a mile to the east at the time of Pococke’s visit about 1740, but has gradually crept nearer, and is now slowly undermining the very site of the town.
