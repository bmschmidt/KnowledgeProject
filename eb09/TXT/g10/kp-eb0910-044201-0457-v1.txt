GERBA or Jerba, German Dscherba, an island off the African coast in the Gulf of Gabes, belonging to the regency of Tunis. It is flat and well wooded with date palms, has an area of 425 square miles, and contains a population of 30,000. Most of the inhabitants are of Berber origin, though a certain proportion have adopted the Arabic language. About 5000 Jews live apart in villages of their own, and a number of European merchants are settled in the chief town of Haumt-es-Suk for the purposes of trade. The island has a considerable reputation for the manufacture of the woollen tissues interwoven with silk which are known as burnous stuffs; a market for the sale of sponges from the neighbouring seas is held from November till March; and a good trade is maintained in the export of dates and other fruits. Gerba is the Lothophagitis or Lotus-eaters' Island of the Greek and Roman geographers, and it may also be identified with the Brachion of Scylax. The modern name appears as early as the 3d century in Aurelius Victor, who, mentioning the births of the emperors Gallus Trebonianus and Volusianus his son, says—“Creati in insula Meninge, quae nunc Girba dicitur.” Meninge or Meninx was the name of one of the two ancient towns in the island, the other being Thoar. A castle erected by the Spaniards in 1284 at IIaumt-es-Suk still remains; but the pyramid built of the skulls of the Spaniards under Garcia, who perished in 1516, was removed in 1837.
