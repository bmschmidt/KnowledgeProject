GALLIPOLI * an important seaport town of Italy, in the province of Lecce, and about 25 miles N.E. of the city of that name, beautifully situated on a rocky islet on the east 3h0re of the Gulf of Taranto, and connected by a long stone bridge of twelve arches with the suburb of Lizza on the mainland. The town is well built and fortified, and has a castle erected by Charles I. of Anjou, a large cathedral, a gymnasium, and an episcopal seminary. It is chiefly noted for its extensive cisterns cut in the solid rock for containing the olive oil collected from all parts of Puglia; but it has besides a productive tunny fishery, and manufactures muslins, cotton stockings, and woollen goods. The harbour has been improved since 1855 by a new mole, but the entrance is still [9:10:43] somewhat dangerous. In 1873 there entered 350 vessels with a total tonnage of 66,652 tons, 281 being Italian and 29 British. The principal exports are oil (of which 9628 tons were shipped in 1875), wine, oats, and cotton seed; and the imports, fish from Norway, manufactured goods from France, petroleum from the United States, staves from Austria, and wheat and barley from Greece and Turkey. The population of the town in 1871 wa8 7578, and of the commune 9951. Gallipoli preserves the name and almost certainly occupies the site of the ancient Callipolis, the “Beautiful City,” founded, according to Dionysius, by a Spartan named Leucippus and a number of the citizens of Tarentum.
