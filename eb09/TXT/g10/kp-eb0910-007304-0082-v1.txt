GARBO, Raffaellino del (1466-1524), a Florentine painter. His real name was Raffaello Capponi; Del Garbo was a nickname, bestowed upon him seemingly from the graceful nicety (parbo) of his earlier works. He was a scholar of Filippino Lippi, with whom he remained till 1490, if not later. He showed great facility in design, and excited hopes which the completed body of his works fell short of. He married and had a large family; embarrassments and a haphazard manner of work ensued; and finally he lapsed into a very dejected and penurious condition. Three of his best tempera pictures are in the Berlin Gallery; one of the Madonna standing with her Infant between two musician-angels, is particularly attractive. We may also name the oil-painting of the Resurrection done for the church of Monte Oliveto, Florence, now in the academy of the same city, ordinarily reputed to be Raffaellinoâ€™s masterpiece[9:10:74]; the ceiling of the Caraffa Chapel in the church of the Minerva, Rome; and a Coronation of the Virgin in the Louvre, which is a production of much merit, though with somewhat over-studied grace. Angelo Allori was his pupil.
