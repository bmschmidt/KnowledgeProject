GESNER, Johann Matthias (1691-1761), a distinguished German classical scholar, was born at Roth near Ansbach, 9th April 1691. He studied at the university of Jena, and in 1714 published a work on the Philopatris ascribed to Lucian. In 1715 he became librarian and conrector at Weimar, in 1729 rector of the gymnasium at Ansbach, and in 1730 rector of the Thomas school at Leipsic, where he had for colleagues Joh. A. Ernesti and J oh. Sebastian Bach. On the foundation of the university of Göttingen he became professor of rhetoric and subsequently librarian also. He died at Gottingen 3d August 1761. His special merit as a classicist is the attention he devoted to the explanation and illustration of the subjeet matter of the classical authors.
