GIEN, a town of France, at the head of an arrondissement in the department of Loiret, is situated on the right bank of the Loire, 39 miles E.S.E. of Orleans. The Loire is crossed at Gien by a stone bridge of twelve arches, built about the end of the 15th century. The town is the seat of a tribunal of the first instance and of a justice of peace court. The principal buildings are the prison, the hospital, the old castle, originally built by Charlemagne, and reconstructed in 1494 byÂ· Anne de Beaujeu, daughter of Louis XL, and the church of Saint Pierre, a modern structure of no particular merit, but possessing an old square tower dating from the end of the 15th century. There are manufactures of serge, leather, and earthenware, and some trade in corn and wine. The population in 1876 was 6493.
