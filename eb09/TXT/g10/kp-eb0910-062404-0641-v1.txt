GISORS, a town of France, department of Eure, is situated in a pleasant valley on the Epte, 45 miles E.N.E. of Paris. Of its ancient castle, which dates from the 12th century, and was at one time one of the principal strongholds in the kingdom, the octagonal keep, built by Henry II. of England, remains entire, and the rest of the ruins still present an imposing appearance. Its ancient ramparts have been converted into promenades. There is a fine old church, the choir of which was built in 1240, and contains windows with portraits of Blanche of Castile and Louis VIII. The north portal is a good specimen of the florid style of the Renaissance. The church contains some fine sculptures and paintings. The principal other buildings are the communal college, the convent, and the hospital. The industries include tanning, brewing, cotton-spinning, and bleaching. The population in 1876 was 3590.
