GOLD HILL, a town of Storey county, Nevada, United Stites, is situated at the head of a precipitous ravine of the Nevada mountains, 1 mile S. of Virginia city, and 328 E. from San Francisco by rail. The name was derived from a small hill connected with the famous Comstock lode, and containing rich golden ore. Some of the most valuable mines of this lode are within the limits of the town, the average yield being about two million dollars monthly in gold and silver. Though there are some quartz mills within the town, the greater part of the ore is conveyed to the mills on Carson river. There is a fine hall in connexion with the minersâ€™ union, and another has been erected by the Oddfellows and Freemasons. The Methodists, Episcopalians, and Roman Catholics are the principal denominations of the town. Gold Hill obtains its water supply in conjunction with Virginia from the summit of the Sierra Nevada, 25 miles distant. The population in 1860 was 638, and in 1870 4311. Since then it has been rapidly increasing, and must have more than trebled its numbers.
