GAGE, Thomas (1720-1787), governor of Massachusetts, second son of the first Viscount Gage, was born in England in 1720. He entered the army at an early age, became lieutenant-colonel of the 44th regiment of foot in 1750, was made major-general and governor of Montreal in 1761, and in 1763 succeeded Amherst in the command of the British forces in America. In 1774 he was appointed governor of Massachusetts, and in that capacity was entrusted with carrying into effect the Boston Port Act. In this political crisis, by his hesitancy in adopting measures against the leaders of the insurrectionary party, and contenting himself with fortifying Boston, he enabled the Americans to mature their plans in comparative security. The battle at Lexington, in which a detachment sent by him, on the 18th April 1775, to destroy the cannon and ammunition at Concord was defeated, inaugurated the American revolutionary war. On the 12th June he proclaimed martial law, and proscribed Samuel Adams and John Hancock, offering pardon to all the other rebels who should return to their allegiance; but the result of these measures was at once to exasperate and encourage the Americans. Although Gage gained the nominal victory of Bunkerâ€™s Hill (June 17), he was unable to raise the siege of Boston; and being shortly afterwards superseded by General Howe, he sailed for England. He died in 1787.
