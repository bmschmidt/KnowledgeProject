GNESEN (Polish, Gniezno), the chief town of a circle in the Prussian province of Posen, government of Bromberg, is situated on the Wrzesnia, 30 miles E.N.E. of Posen. Besides the cathedral, which contains the remains of St Adalbert, there are nine Roman Catholic churches, and there is also a Protestant church, a synagogue, a clerical seminary, and a convent of the Franciscan nuns. The industries are cloth and linen weaving and brandy making. A great horse and cattle market is held annually. The population in 1875 was 11,203, of whom about half are Poles.

Gnesen is said to be the oldest town in Poland, and was the capital of the kingdom till 1320. It was made the seat of an archbishop early in the 11th century. It is still the seat of the cathedral chapter, but the archbishop now resides at Posen.
