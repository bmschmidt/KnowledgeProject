GARAT, Pierre-Jean (1764-1823), one of the most famous singers of his time, nephew of the former, was born at Ustaritz, 25th April 1764. Gifted with a voice of exceptional timbre and compass, he devoted himself, from an early age, to the cultivation of his musical talents. On account of his manifesting a distaste for the legal profession, for which his father wished him to study, he was deprived of his allowance, but he obtained through the patronage of a friend the office of secretary to Comte dâ€™Artois, and was afterwards engaged to give musical lessons to the queen of France. After the Revolution he became a professional singer, and on account of a song which he had composed in ieference to the misfortunes of the royal family he was thrown into prison. On regaining his liberty he went to Hamburg, where he at once achieved extraordinary success: and by his subsequent appearances in Paris, and his visits to Italy, Spain, Germany, and Russia, he made for himself a reputation as a singer unequalled by any other of his own time. He was a keen partisan of the composer Gluck in opposition to Handel. On the institution of the Conservatoire de Musique, he became its professor of singing. He is also the composer of a number of songs, many of which have considerable merit. He died 1st March 1823.
