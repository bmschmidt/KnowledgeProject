GANDO, a kingdom of north-western Africa in the Sudan, comprising that part of the territory watered by the Quorra or Niger which extends from the Birni and Say in the N.
[9:10:68]

to Idda iu the S. It was established by the Fulah or Fulatah on the dissolution of the Houssa kingdom of Katchena by the death in 1817 of Sheik Othιnan dan Foddie. The political unity of the various parts of the kingdom is with difficulty maintained, and the process of disintegration has begun. Among the separate districts or provinces are Libtako in the north, Yaga, Saberma, Gurma, Dendima, a great part of Yoruba with the town of Ilori, Yauri, part of Nupe or Nyffe, and part of Borgu. The chief town is Gando, situated on the Sokoto, the first considerable affluent of the Niger from the east, not far from the town of Sokoto, which is the capital of the powerful kingdom of that name. Rabba, Egga, Busah, Igbegbo, and Bida are among the more important towns. The whole Gando territory is estimated at 81,500 square miles, and its population at 5,800,000. See Barth’s Travels in Central Africa, and Baikie, “Journey from Bida to Kano,” in Joum. Jioy. Ceoy. Soc., 1867.
