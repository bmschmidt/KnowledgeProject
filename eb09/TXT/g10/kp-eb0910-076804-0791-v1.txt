GÖLNITZ, or Göllnitz (Golniczbänya), a mining town of Hungary, on a river of the same name, in the county of Szepes (Zips), about 18 miles south-west of Eperies, 48° 51' N. lat., 20° 59' E. long. In the vicinity are iron and copper mines, which, with the forges, and the nail and wire factories, &c., afford employment to most of the inhabitants. It is the seat of a mining council and tribunal, has Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, post and telegraph offices, and a high school. In 1870 the population amounted to 5205, composed of Magyars, Slavs, and Germans. Gölnitz was formerly a royal free town; its chief importance now is as a mining centre.
