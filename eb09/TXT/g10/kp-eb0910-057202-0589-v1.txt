GIARRE, a town of Sicily, in the province of Catania, between Etna and the sea, with a station on the railway from Messiua to Catania, distant from the former 40 miles, and from the latter nearly 19. It is a flourishing place of 6956 inhabitants, according to the census of 1871, or of 9990 if the suburbs of Macchia, St Giovanni, and St Alfio are included; but it has little to show except a handsome modern church, and is mainly of interest as the point from which tourists start to visit the remains of the gigantic chestnut tree of the hundred horses (di cento cavalli).
