GEBWEILER, in French Guebwiller, a town of the German imperial province of Alsace-Lorraine, in the district of Upper Alsace, situated about 13 miles south of Colmar, at the mouth of the Blumenthal or “Vale of Flowers.” It communicates by a branch line with the railway between Strasburg and Basel. Among the principal buildings are the Roman Catholic church of St Leodgar, dating from the 12th ceutury, the Evangelical church, the synagogue, the town-house, and the old Dominican convent now used as a market and concert-hall. The spinning, weaving, bleaching, and dyeing of cotton is the chief industry, but woollen goods and silk ribbons, as well as machinery, are also manufactured. Gebweiler is mentioned as early as 774. It belonged to the religious foundation of Murbach, and in 1759 the abbots chose it for their residence. At the French Revolution of 1789, however, the chapter house was laid in ruins, and though the archives were rescued and removed to Colmar, the library perished in the devastation. Population in 1871, 11,104; in 1875, 11,622.
