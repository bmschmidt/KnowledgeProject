GAD is also the name of a “prophet” or “seer,” who was· probably a pupil of Samuel at Naioth, and a companion of David, to whom he early attached himself. It is not known to which tribe he belonged. He is first mentioned in 1 Sam. xxii. 5 as having joined David while he was “in the hold ;” and he afterwards became a member of his regal court, where he seems to have held an official position, being occasionally designated as “the king’s seer.” He assisted in organizing the musical service of the “houso of of God” (2 Chr. xxix. 25), and also wrote a “book of the acts of David,” which is referred to in 1 Chr. xxix. 29.
