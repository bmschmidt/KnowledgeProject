GALE, Thomas (1636-1702), an eminent classical scholar, was born at Scruton, Yorkshire, in 1636. He was educated at Westminster School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, of which he became a fellow. In 1666 he was appointed regius professor of Greek, in 1672 headmaster of St Paul’s School, in 1676 a fellow of the Royal Society, and also prebendary of St Paul’s, and in 1697 dean of York. He died at York in 1702. Gale published a collection of Opuscula Mythological Ethica, et Physica, and editions of several Greek and Latin authors, but his fame rests chiefly on his collection of old works bearing on early English history, entitled Historiae Anglicanes Scriptores and Historiae Bmtannicae, Saxonicae, Anglo-Danicae, Scriptores XV. He is the author of the inscription on the London Monument in which the Roman Catholics are accused of having originated the great fire.
