GARDINER, Colonel James (1687—1745), a Scottish soldier, was born at Carriden in Linlithgowshire, January 10, 1687. At the age of fourteen he entered a Scottish regiment in the Dutch service, and was afterwards present at the battle of. Ramillies, where he was wounded. He subsequently served in different cavalry regiments, and in 1730 was advanced to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and in 1743 to that of colonel. He fell at the battle of Prestonpans, September 1,1745. The circumstances of his death are describedin Sir Walter Scott’s Waverley. In his early years he was distinguished for his recklessness and profligacy, but, in 1719, a supernatural vision, as he regarded it, led to his conversion; and from that time he lived a life of great devoutness and of thorough consistency with his Christian profession. His life was written by Dr Philip Doddridge.
