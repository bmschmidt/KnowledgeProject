GAILLAC, the capital of an arrondissement in the department of Tarn, France, is situated on the right bank of the Tarn, 12 miles W. of Albi. It possesses two churches of the 13th century, a communal college, a hospital, a theatre, and a military prison. Its industries include the manufacture of wine casks, leather, brandy, bricks, and various kinds of coarse cloth; and it has a considerable trade in corn, vegetables, dried plums, and wine, the white and red wines of the arrondissement having a high reputation. Gaillac was in existence in the 7th century. It was captured by the English in 1280, and its archives were taken to London. Even at that time it was famed for its wines, which, under the name of Vin du Coq, were exported to England and Holland. The population in 1876 was 6099.
