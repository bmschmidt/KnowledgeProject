SOWERBY BRIDGE, a manufacturing town in the West Riding of Yorkshire, is situated on both sides of the river Calder, at the termination of the Rochdale Canal, and on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, 2 miles south-west of Halifax, and 8 north-west of Huddersfield. Christ church, dating from 1526, was rebuilt in 1819. The other public buildings include the town-hall (1857) and the local board offices, opened in 1878, attached to which are the public baths and the slaughter-houses. The town is almost entirely the growth of the last fifty years. It possesses worsted and cotton mills, iron-works, dyeworks, and chemical works. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 536 acres) in 1871 was 7041, and in 1881 it was 8724.
