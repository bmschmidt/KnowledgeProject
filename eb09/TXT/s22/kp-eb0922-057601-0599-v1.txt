STONE, a market-town of Staffordshire, England, on the river Trent, and on the North Staffordshire Railway, 7 miles south of Stoke and 7 north of Stafford. Part of the walls remain of an abbey which dates from the foundation of a college of canons in 670. The present church was opened in 1750. The inhabitants are employed chiefly in shoemaking, but malting, brewing, and tanning are also carried on. The population of the urban sanitary district (estimated area 1000 acres) was 5669 in 1881.
