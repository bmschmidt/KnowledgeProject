STARO-KONSTANTINOFF, a district town of Russia, in the government of Volhynia, situated 121 miles to the west-south-west of Zhitomir. It is an old-fashioned, poorly built town, dating from the 16th century, and is often mentioned in history in connexion with the rising of Cossacks under Bogdan Khmelnitzky. Owing to its excellent position close to the Austrian frontier and its railway communication with south-west Russia, it has a very active trade in corn, cattle, and salt with Austria, Prussia, and Poland. Its population (17,980 in 1884, of whom two-thirds were Jews) is rapidly increasing.
