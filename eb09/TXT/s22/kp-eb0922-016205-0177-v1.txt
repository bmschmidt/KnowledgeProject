SŁUTSK, a district town of Russia, in the government of Minsk, situated on the Słutcha river (tributary of the Pripet), 123 miles south of Minsk. This old town is mentioned in the 12th century as a dependency of Kieff, and, like other towns of the region, was devastated by the Tatars, and later suffered in the wars between Russia and Poland. It is now merely a large village, whose inhabitants are chiefly engaged in agriculture, with a little trade in corn, timber, and wooden wares. The immense marshy and woody tracts of the Polyesie (see Minsk) surround it on all sides, the Słutcha being its chief means of communication. Its population remains almost stationary and was 19,000 in 1883.
