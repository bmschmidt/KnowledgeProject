SISTRUM, a kind of rattle used by the ancient Egyptians in religious ceremonies, especially in the worship of Isis. It consisted of a frame through which passed four rods; attached to the frame was a handle. When shaken the rods rattled and produced the sound. After the introduction of Egyptian worships into Italy the Romans became familiar with the sistrum. It is described by Apuleius (Metam., xi. 4). An ancient sistrum formerly existed in the library of Ste Genevi√®ve at Paris. In paintings found at Portici a priest of Isis and a woman are represented rattling the sistrum. The instrument is said to be still in use in Nubia and Abyssinia.
