SOUTH BEND, a city of the United States, the county seat of St Joseph county, Indiana, received its name from its position at a great bend of the St Joseph river, which is navigable to this point from its mouth at St Joseph on Lake Michigan. By railway the city is 85 miles east of Chicago. It is a great manufacturing centre, with ironworks, carriage, waggon, plough, and sewing machine factories, flour-mills, paper-mills, Ac. The court-house is one of the best buildings in the State; and the Roman Catholic university of Notre Dame, St Mary’s academy, and St Joseph’s academy are institutions of some importance. The population of the city numbered 1652 in 1850, 7206 in 1870, and 13,280 in 1880.
