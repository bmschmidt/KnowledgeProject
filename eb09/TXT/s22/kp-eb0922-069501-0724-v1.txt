SURROGATE is a deputy of a bishop or an ecclesiastical judge, acting in the absence of his principal, and strictly bound by the authority of the latter. At present the chief duty of a surrogate is the granting of marriage licences. Quite recently judgments of the arches court of Canterbury have been delivered by a surrogate. The office is unknown in Scotland, but is of some importance in the United States. In the State of New York the surrogate’s court is a court of record, with jurisdiction over the administration of the personal estate of a deceased person and certain other matters. In New Jersey the surrogate is an official of the orphans’ court, grants unopposed probates, &c.
