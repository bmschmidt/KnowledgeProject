SOUTHEND, a watering-place of Essex, is situated on the north bank of the Thames, 5 miles west of Shoeburyness, and by the London, Tilbury, and Southend Railway, 42 miles east of London, with which it is also connected by steamer. It first sprang into notice from a visit of Queen Caroline in 1804, and, as it is the nearest watering-place to London, it is much frequented by excursionists, especially by the poorer classes. It is clean and well built, and at Cliff Town there are a number of large villas. Opposite Cliff Town there is a public garden called the Shrubbery. The bathing is good, but the tide recedes with great rapidity and for nearly a mile. The pier, which is 1 ¼ miles in length, and on which there is a tramway, permits the approach of steamers at all tides. The public hall was erected in 1872 at a cost of £3000, and a mechanics’ institution dates from 1881. The Rochford county court is held every alternate month in the public hall. A local board of health was established in 1866. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 3441 acres) in 1871 was 4561, and in 1881 it was 7979.
