SIMEON second son of Jacob by Leah (Gen.

xxix. 33). The tribe of Simeon, like that of Levi, was broken up at a very early period, under circumstances of which we have some indication in Gen. xxxiv. and xlix. (see Israel, vol. xiii. p. 400 sq., and Levites). In Judges i. the Simeonites appear as sharing the conquests of Judah in the extreme south of Canaan, but there is no mention of them in this region in 1 Sam. xxx., and the tribe is not named at all in the blessing of Moses. It reappears, however, in 1 Chron. iv. 24∙43 (cf . xii. 25), and is reckoned to the kingdom of Ephraim (2 Chron. xv. 9; xxxiv. 6). The Arabian wars of Simeon spoken of in 1 Chron. iv. have been connected by Hitzig and others with a supposed Israelite kingdom of Massa, which they find in Prov. xxxi. 1, translating “Lemuel, king of Massa,” and comparing Gen. XXV. 14 and Isa. xxi. 11 sq., where, however, it is quite gratuitous to suppose an embassy to the prophet from Israelites in Arabia. The whole speculation and the further development of Dozy (The Israelites in Mecca) is fanciful; cf. Wellhausen, Prolegomena, Eng. tr., pp. 212 sq. The heroine of the book of Judith is made to be of the tribe of Simeon, but this book is quite unhistorical.
