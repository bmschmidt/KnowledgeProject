SIMFEROPOL, the capital of the Russian government of Taurida, is situated in the south-western part of the Crimea, on the Salghir (which frequently becomes dry), 900 miles from Moscow. Occupying an admirable site on the northern slopes of the Tchatyr-dagh, it has on the eastern side many beautiful gardens, and is divided into two parts,â€”the European, well built in stone, and the Tartar, which consists of narrow and filthy streets peopled by Tartars and Jews. Although it has grown somewhat since the railway brought it into connexion with the rest of the empire, it still remains a mere administrative centre, without either manufacturing or commercial importance. The population was 16,550 in 1866 and 29,030 in 1881.

In the neighbourhood stood the small fortress Napoli, erected by Skilur, the ruler of Taurida, some hundred years before the Christian era, which existed until the end of the 3d century. Afterwards the Tartars had here their settlement Ak-metchet, which was in the 17th century the residence of the chief military commander of the khan, and had the name of Sultan-serai. In 1736 it was taken and burnt by the Russians, and in 1784, after the conquest of Crimea by the Russians, it received its present name and became the capital of Taurida.
