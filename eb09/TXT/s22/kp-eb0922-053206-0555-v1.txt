STEPHEN II., pope from March 752 to April 757, was in deacon’s orders when chosen to the vacant see within twelve days after the death of Zacharias.^[1. Zacharias died March 15, 752, and a presbyter named Stephen was forthwith chosen to succeed him, who, however, died four days afterwards and before consecration. This Stephen is occasionally called Stephen II., the number of popes of the name being thus raised to ten.] The main[9:22:533] difficulty of his pontificate was in connexion with the aggressive attitude of Aistulf, king of the Lombards. After unsuccessful embassies to Aistulf himself and appeals to the emperor Constantine, he, though in feeble health, set out to seek the aid of Pippin, by whom he was received in the neighbourhood of Vitry le Brulé in the beginning of 754. He spent the greater part of that year at St Denis. The result of his negotiations was the Frankish invasion of Aistulf’s territory and the famous “donation” of Pippin (see Popedom, vol. xix. p. 495; and compare France, vol. ix. p. 531). The death of Stephen took place not long after that of Aistulf. He was succeeded by Paul I.
