STOLP, or Stolpe, an ancient trading-town in the bleak coast-plain of eastern Pomerania, Prussia, is situated on the Stolpe, 10 miles from the Baltic Sea and 64 miles to the west of Dantzic. The large church of St Mary, with a lofty tower, dating from the 14th century, the Renaissance castle of the 16th century, now used as a prison, and one of the ancient town-gates restored in 1872 are memorials of the time when Stolp was a prosperous member of the Hanseatic League. The manufacture of amber articles, tobacco and cigars, cigar-boxes, &c., with some ironfounding, linen-weaving, and salmon-fishing in the Stolpe, are the chief industrial occupations of the inhabitants, who also carry on trade in grain, cattle, spirits, fish, and geese. Stolpm√ºnde, a fishing-village and summer resort, at the mouth of the river, is the port of Stolp. The population of Stolp in 1885 was 22,431 (in 1816 5260), about 600 being Roman Catholics and about 1000 Jews.

Stolp, mentioned in the 11th century, received town-rights in 1273. From the 14th to the 16th century it was a member of the Hanseatic League. Until 1637, when it passed to Brandenburg, the town was generally in the possession of the dukes of Pomerania.
