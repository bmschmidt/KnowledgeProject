STEVENSON, Robert (1772-1850), civil engineer, was the only son of Alan Stevenson, partner in a West Indian house in Glasgow, and was born in that city 8th June 1772. Having lost his father in infancy, he removed with his mother to Edinburgh. In his youth he assisted his stepfather, Thomas Smith, in his lighthouse schemes, and at the early age of nineteen was sent to superintend the erection of a lighthouse on the island of Little Cumbrae. During successive winters he attended classes at Anderson’s College, Glasgow, and at Edinburgh university. He succeeded his stepfather, whose daughter he married in 1799, as engineer to the Board of Northern Lighthouses, and at the same time began general practice as a civil engineer. During his period of office from 1797 to 1843, he designed aud executed no fewer than eighteen lighthouses, the most important being that on the Bell Rock, begun in 1807 and completed in 1810, in which he improved considerably on the designs of Smeaton for the Eddystone lighthouse (see Lighthouse, vol. xiv. p. 616). For its illumination he introduced an improved apparatus; he was also the author of various other valuable inventions in connexion with lighting, including the intermittent and flashing lights, and the mast lantern for ships. In his general practice as a civil engineer he was employed in the construction of many county roads, in various important improvements in connexion with the approaches to Edinburgh, including that by the Calton Hill, in the erection of slips at ferries, in the construction of harbours, docks, and breakwaters, in the improvement of river and canal navigation, and in the construction of several important bridges. It was he that brought into notice the superiority of malleable iron rods for railways over the old cast iron, and he was the inventor of the movable jib and balance cranes. It was chiefly through his interposition that an Admiralty survey was established, from which the Admiralty sailing directions for the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland have been prepared. Stevenson was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1815, and afterwards became a member of the Geological and Astronomical Societies of London and the Wernerian and Antiquarian Societies of Scotland. He published an account of the Bell Rock lighthouse in 1824, and, besides contributing important articles on engineering subjects to Brewster’s Edinburgh Encyclopaedia and the Encyclopaedia Britannica, was the author of various papers read before the societies he was connected with. He died at Edinburgh 12th July 1850.

A Life of Robert Stevenson, by his son David Stevenson, appeared in 1878. David Stevenson (1815-86), who along with his brother Alan succeeded to his father’s business, was the author of a Sketch of the Civil Engineering of North America (1838, republished in “Weale’s Series,” 1859), Marine Surveying (1842), Canal and River Engineering (1858; 2d ed. enlarged, 1872; 3d ed. 1886), and of various papers read before learned societies.
