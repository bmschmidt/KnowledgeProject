STAUNTON, a city of the United States, the county-seat of Augusta county, Virginia, lies at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains, on the Lewis Creek (a tributary of the Shenandoah), 136 miles west-north-west of Richmond. It is the seat of the State lunatic asylum and of the State institution for the deaf and dumb and blind, and has besides an unusual number of important educational establishments. Iron-works, planing-mills, and flour-mills represent the manufacturing interest. The population was 5120 in 1870 and 6664 in 1880.
