SLOUGH, an urban sanitary district of Buckinghamshire, England, is situated on the Great Western Railway, 18 Â½ miles west of London and 2 north of Windsor. Within recent years it has largely increased, and it contains a number of good shops and villas. It is supplied with water from artesian wells. The parish church of St Mary, erected 1837, has been recently enlarged. Among other public buildings are the British orphan asylum, the Eton union workhouse, and the reading-room and literary institute. Sir William Herschel, the astronomer, resided at Slough, and there constructed his telescope. The population of the urban sanitary district, which embraces parts of the parishes of Stoke Poges and Upton-cum-Chalvey, in 1871 was 4509, and in 1881 (area, 401 acres) it was 5095.
