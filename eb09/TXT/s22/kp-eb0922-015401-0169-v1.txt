SŁAVYANSK, a town of Russia, in the government of Kharkoff, situated 158 miles by rail to the south-east of the town of Kharkoff, on the Torets river and close by several salt lakes. From these salt is extracted to the annual value of more than £10,000; there are also several tallow-works in the place. The Stavyansk merchants carry on a brisk trade in salt, cattle, and tallow. The population (11,650 in 1870) reached 15,400 in 1883.

The ancient name of Stavyansk was Tor. The town, which is supposed to occupy the site of a former settlement of the Torks (Turks) who inhabited the steppes of the Don, was founded in 1676 by the Russians to protect the salt marshes. Having an open steppe behind it, this fort was often destroyed by the Tatars. Its salt trade became insignificant in the 18th century and has only revived during the last twenty years since coal was brought from Ekaterinoslaff.
