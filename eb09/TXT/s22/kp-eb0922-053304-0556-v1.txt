STEPHEN VI., pope from May 896 to July-August 897, succeeded Boniface VI., and was in turn followed by Romanus. He is remembered only in connexion with his conduct towards the remains of Formosus, his last predecessor but one (see Formosus). It excited a tumult, which ended in his imprisonment and his death by strangling.
