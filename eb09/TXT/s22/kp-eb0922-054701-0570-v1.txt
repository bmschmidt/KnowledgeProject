STEYR, Steier, or Steyer, an industrial town in Upper Austria, is situated on an island at the junction of the Steyr and Enns, 20 miles to the south of Linz and 92 miles to the west-south-west of Vienna. The main town is connected by two bridges with the suburbs of Steyrdorf and Ennsdorf. The Gothic parish church was built in 1443; the town-house is modern. The interesting old castle of the princes of Lamberg, dating from the 10th century, rises on an eminence near the town. Steyr[9:22:548] is one of the chief seats of the iron and steel industry in Upper Austria (Austria, vol. iii. p. 120), and very large quantities of cutlery, scythes, sickles, and edge-tools are annually produced in the town and neighbourhood. The Werndl small-arms factory, now carried on by a joint-stock company, and employing 4500 hands, is the largest in Austria. The population in 1880 was 17,199. Steyr was the capital of an early countship or grafschaft, at first belonging to Styria, but annexed to Austria in 1192.
