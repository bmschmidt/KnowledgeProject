SMITH, Sir Thomas (1512-1577), the contemporary and friend of Sir John Cheke, was born at Saffron-Walden in Essex in 1512. He became a fellow of Queens’ College, Cambridge, in 1531, and was afterwards appointed to read the public Greek lecture, in the discharge of which function he first introduced the new Greek pronunciation, which soon became universal in England. After studying in France and Italy and taking a degree in law at Padua, he was appointed first regius professor of civil law in Cambridge in 1542. During Somerset’s protectorate he entered public life and was sent as ambassador first to Brussels and afterwards to France. In 1548 he was made a secretary of state and knighted. On the accession of Mary he was deprived of all his offices, but in the succeeding reign was frequently employed in public affairs. He died in 1577.

His best-known work, entitled Be Republica Anglorum: the Maner of Government or Policie of the Realme of England, was published posthumously in 1583, and passed through many editions. His epistle to Gardiner, De recta et emendata linguae Graecae pronunciatione, was printed at Paris in 1568; the same volume includes his dialogue Be recta et emendata linguae Anglicanae scriptione.
