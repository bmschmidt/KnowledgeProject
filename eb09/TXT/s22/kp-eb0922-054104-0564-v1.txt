STERNBERG, a manufacturing town in Moravia, Austria, is situated 9 miles to the north of Olmiitz and 47 miles to the north-east of Br√ºnn. It is the chief seat of the Moravian cotton industry, and it also carries on the manufacture of linen, stockings, liqueurs, sugar, and bricks. Its six suburbs and the surrounding districts are also engaged in the textile industry. Fruit, especially cherries, and tobacco are grown in the neighbourhood. The population in 1880 was 14,243. Sternberg is said to have grown up under the shelter of a castle founded by Yaroslaff of Sternberg on the site of his victory over the Mongols in 1241.
