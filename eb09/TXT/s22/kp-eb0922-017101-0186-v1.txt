SMITH, Albert (1816-1860), an instance of the journalistic rather than the truly literary type of writer, was one of the most popular men of his time; a favourite humourist in the vein of humour then in vogue, but now already rather out of date; a leading contributor to Punch; the author of successful books of light social satire; and, not least, the exponent of “Mont Blanc” in a pre-scientific popular entertainment descriptive of that famous mountain. He was born at Chertsey, Surrey, on 24th May 1816, and was educated to follow his father’s profession of a surgeon. Having, in the course of his medical studies, been to the Hôtel Dieu, Paris, his first literary effort was an account of his life there, which appeared in the Mirror. [9:22:172] From this time he gradually relinquished his medical work for the more congenial occupation of light literature. He was associated with Punch from its beginning, and was also a regular contributor to Bentley's Miscellany, in whose pages his first and best book, The Adventures of Mr Ledbury, first appeared. His other books were A History of Evening Parties, Christopher Tadpole, issued in monthly parts, Pottleton's Legacy, and, as a series of so-called natural histories, The Gent, The Ballet Girl, The Idler upon Town, and The Flirt. Albert Smith also wrote extravaganzas and adapted some of Charles Dickens’s stories for the stage. He conducted too for a time a magazine called The Man in the Moon, which was discontinued in 1849. In 1851 he visited the Alps and ascended Mont Blanc, and the year after produced the descriptive entertainment before referred to. “China,” a similar entertainment, was afterwards produced, but less successfully. Smith married in 1859 a daughter of Keeley, the comedian. He died at Fulham, Middlesex, on 23d May 1860, from an attack of apoplexy.
