SIEDLCE, capital of the above government, is situated 57 miles east-south-east of Warsaw, on the Brest-Litovsk Railway. It received municipal institutions in 1547. The Oginskis, to whom it belonged, have embellished it with a palace and gardens; but it is still nothing more than a large village, where the provincial authorities have their seat. Its population was 12,950 in 1882.
