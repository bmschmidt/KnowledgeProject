SIMPLICIUS, the successor of Pope Hilarius or Hilarus, was a native of Tibur, and was consecrated bishop of Rome on February 25, 468. He died March 2, 483, and was succeeded by Felix III. His extant letters, which date from the banishment of Romulus Augustulus and the early years of Odoacerâ€™s reign, relate almost entirely to the ecclesiastical and court intrigues of Alexandria and Constantinople in connexion with the Monophysite controversy.
