STORAX. It has been explained in Incense (vol. xii. p. 718) and Liquidambar (vol. xiv. p. 687) that the storax of commerce and the pharmacopceia (used as an emollient) is derived from the Oriental liquidambar tree. The storax of the ancients, on the other hand, a solid gum which does not now occur in commerce, appears to have been the product of the beautiful white-flowered shrub Styrax officinalis, which is still common on Carmel and elsewhere in Syria. It was much used as an incense, and formed an early and important article of Phoenician trade (see Movers, Phönizier, ii. 3. 101, 223 sq.). It is probable that the Greek word στύραξ is of Semitic origin, representing the Hebrew צרי, which the English version renders “balm” (Lagarde, Mittheilungen, p. 234 sqj).
