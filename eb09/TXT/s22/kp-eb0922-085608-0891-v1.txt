SZOLNOK, the capital of the county of JÃ¡sz-Nagy-Kun-Szolnok, Hungary, is situated on the Theiss and the Zagyva, and is the junction of four railways. It carries on a brisk trade in tobacco, salt, and especially in wood. In 1880 the population (Magyars), chiefly Roman Catholics, numbered 18,247, and in 1885 about 19,000.
