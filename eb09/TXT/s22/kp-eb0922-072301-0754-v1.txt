SUSANNA (“Lily”), the heroine of one of the apocryphal additions to the Greek text of the book of Daniel, the others being the Song of the Three Children and the story of Bel and the Dragon. In the English version the story of the virtuous Susanna—the false accusation brought against her by the elders and her deliverance by the judgment of Daniel—is put as a separate book. Jerome, in his Preface to Daniel, points out that it had been observed both by Jews and Christians that this story was certainly written by a Greek, and not translated from Hebrew, since Daniel makes a series of Greek puns on the names of trees.
