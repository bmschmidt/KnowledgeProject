STRATFORD, a town of Canada, capital of Perth county, Ontario, lies on the river Avon (a tributary of the Thames which discharges into Lake St Clair), about 45 miles by rail south-east of Goderich, at the junction of the Goderich and Buffalo division with the main line of the Grand Trunk Railway. In 1849 it was a village of only

200 inhabitants; but between 1871 and 1881 its population rose from 4313 to 8239. It has a town-hall, extensive repairing shops, and several manufactures.
