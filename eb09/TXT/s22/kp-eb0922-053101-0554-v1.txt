STEINAMANGER (Hung. Szomlathely ; Lat. Sabaria), the chief town of the trans-Danubian county of Vas, Hungary, is an old place of some interest. Though it has only 12,000 inhabitants, it is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop, and has a Dominican convent, a seminary, gymnasium, chamber of advocates, large orphanage, fine theatre, and a number of superior Government offices. The interior of the cathedral is of great beauty, in the Italian style. The town is at the junction of four different railways, and is rapidly rising in importance.
