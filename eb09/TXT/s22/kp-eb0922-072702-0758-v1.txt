SUTTON COLDFIELD, an ancient market town and municipal borough of Warwickshire, England, is situated on the London and North-Western Railway, 8 miles south of Lichfield and 7 north-east of Birmingham. The town has been greatly increased of late years by the erection of villas for persons having their business offices in Birmingham, Walsall, and other towns. The church of the Holy Trinity—Early English and Late Perpendicular, restored in 1874 and enlarged in 1879—contains a fine Norman font and the tomb of Bishop Vesey. He obtained from Henry VIII. the grant of the park and manorial rights for the benefit of the town, the annual value (now about £2000) being expended in charities and education. On the picturesque park near the town, 2400 acres in extent, the inhabitants have the right of grazing horses and cattle at a small fee. A town-hall was erected in 1859; in it there is a good library. The corporation formerly consisted of a warden and 24 members; but in 1885 Sutton obtained a municipal charter, by which it is divided into six wards, with an alderman and three councillors for each ward. The population of the township in 1871 was 5936, and in 1881 it was 7737.

Sutton was at one time a royal manor and an apanage of the earls of Warwick. It owes much of its prosperity to the gifts of John Vesey (Voysey), bishop of Exeter in the 16th century, who was a native of the place. In its charter of incorporation, 20th Henry VIII., it is called the royal town of Sutton Coldfield.
