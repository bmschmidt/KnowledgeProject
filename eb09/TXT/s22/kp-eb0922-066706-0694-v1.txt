SURBITON, a suburb of Kingston in Surrey, England, is finely situated on the river Thames, 12 miles south-west of London by the London and South-Western Railway. It consists chiefly of villa residences embosomed in woods and gardens. Along the river an esplanade has been constructed, forming a pleasant promenade. Surbiton is the headquarters of the Kingston Rowing Club and the Thames Sailing Club. The recreation ground, in connexion with which there is a reading-room and library, is much frequented for athletic meetings and bicycle races. In the town there is a cottage hospital. The population of the urban sanitary district (area, 1000 acres) in 1871 was 7642, and in 1881 it was 9406.
