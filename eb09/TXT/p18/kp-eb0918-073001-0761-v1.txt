PHARAOH (HJFiB; Φαραώ), which the Old Testament often uses as if it were a proper name, applicable to any king of Egypt, though sometimes such a distinguishing name as Hophra (Apries; Jer. xliv. 30) or Nechoh (Nekos) (2 Kings xxiii. 29) is added, is really an Egyptian title of the monarch (Perãa or Phuro), often found on the monuments. Apart from Hophra and Necho the Biblical Pharaohs cannot, in the present state of Hebrew and Egyptian chronology, be identified with any certainty.
