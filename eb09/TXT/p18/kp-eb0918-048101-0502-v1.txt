PELUSIUM, an ancient city of Egypt, at the mouth of the most easterly (Pelusiae) branch of the Nile, was the key of the land towards Syria and a strong fortress, which, from the Persian invasion at least, played a great part in all wars between Egypt and the East. It has not, however, been satisfactorily identified with any place mentioned in the hieroglyphic monuments, and the conjecture of Jerome, who supposes it to be the Sin of Ezekiel xxx. 15, 16, though admirably suited to the context and certainly preferable to the Sais of the LXX., cannot be positively established. Pelusium is the Faramá of the Arabs; the neighbouring place still called Tina is hardly to be identified etymologically with Sin. The country about Pelusium was noted for the production of flax; the fame of the Pelusian linen is, perhaps, still preserved in the word “blouse.” The whole district has now relapsed into sand and marsh, and the site has not yielded any important remains.
