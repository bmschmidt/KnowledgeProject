PERU, a city of the United States in La Salle county, Illinois, lies 68 miles above Peoria at the head of navigation on the Illinois river, is a station on the Chicago, Rock

Island, and Pacific Railroad, and is connected by a tramway (1 mile) with La Salle, the terminus of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Flour-mills, a plough-factory, and zinc-works are among the chief industrial establishments: coal-mining[9:18:680] is largely prosecuted in the vicinity; and 125,000 tons of ice are yearly despatched to the southern markets. The population was 3132 in 1860 and 4632 in 1880 (township, 5053).
