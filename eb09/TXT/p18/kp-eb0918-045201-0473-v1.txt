PEEKSKILL, a manufacturing village of the United States in Cortlandt township, Westchester county, New York, lies on the east bank of the Hudson, 43 miles above New York city, with which it has communication by rail and (in summer) by river. Besides iron-smelting, it carries on the manufacture of railings, stoves, and fire-bricks. A church, dating from 1767, and the Van Cortlandt mansion are among its principal buildings. Incorporated in 1816, Peekskill had 6560 inhabitants in 1870 and 6893 in 1880.
