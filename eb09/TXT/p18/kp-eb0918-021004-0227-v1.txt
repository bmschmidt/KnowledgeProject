PANDARUS, son of Lycaon, led the people of Zeleia in the Troad as allies of the Trojans against the Greeks. In other passages his country is named Lycia. It is frequently said that the Lycians of the Iliad are a tribe of the Troad, different from the people of the country Lycia; but it is more probable that the conflicting accounts belong to different strata in the Homeric poetry. Pandarus was worshipped as a hero at Pinara in Lycia. Lycaon, the name of Pandarus’s father, is merely an epithet of Apollo, the great god of Lycia. Pandarus is not an important figure in the Iliad. He breaks the truce between the Trojans and the Greeks by treacherously wounding Menelaus with an arrow, and finally he is slain by Diomedes. In mediaeval romance he became a prominent figure in the tale of Troilus and Cressida. He encouraged the amour between the Trojan prince and his niece Cressida; and his name has passed into modern language as the common title of a lovers’ go-between in the worst sense.
