PALIMPSEST, a term applied to any material from which writing has been removed to make room for another text, and which has thus been prepared or scraped a second time (7rαλi∕n∕n7στoς). Such an object therefore as an inscribed monumental stone or brass may be made palimpsest.
[9:18:186]

But the term is most commonly applied to ancient MSS. which have undergone this treatment. See Palaeography.
