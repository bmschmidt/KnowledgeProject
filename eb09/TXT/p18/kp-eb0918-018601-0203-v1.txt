PALINDROME (πάλιν, again, and δρόμος, a course), a verse or sentence which runs the same when read either backwards or forwards. Such is the verse—

Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor; or

Signa te, signa, temere me tangis et angis; or νίψον ανομήματα μή μάναν tfψιv ^[1. This last is from the καρκίνοι of the emperor Leo VI., the Philosopher, and occurs in a palindrome piece of twenty-seven lines, which can be seen in the Excerpta Varia of Leo Allatius (1641). See also 27. and Q δth ser., vii. 372, via. 77.]

Odo tenet mulum, madidam mappam tenet Anna, Anna tenet mappam madidam, mulum tenet Odo.
