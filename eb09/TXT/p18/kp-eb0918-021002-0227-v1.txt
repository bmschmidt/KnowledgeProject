PÁNCH MAHÁS, a district in the east of Guzerat, Bombay presidency, India, lying between 22° 30' and 23° 10' N. lat., and between 73° 35' and 74° 10'E. long., with an area of 1613 square miles. The south-western portion is for .the most part a level plain of rich soil; while the northern, although it comprises some fertile valleys, is generally rugged, undulating, and barren, with but little cultivation. The mineral products comprise limestone, sandstone, trap, quartz, basalt, granite, and other varieties of building stone. Only recently has any attempt been made to conserve the extensive forest tracts, and consequently but little timber of any size is now to be found.

The census of 1881 returned the population at 255,479 (131,162 males and 124,317 females); the Hindus numbered 159,624; Mohammedans, 16,060; Parsis, 30; and Christians, 44. Of the total population 30 per cent, belong to aboriginal tribes, the majority being Bhils. Of 350,996 acres—the total area of Government cultivable land—202,498 acres were taken up for cultivation in 1881-82. Of 153,262 acres under actual cultivation (41,828 acres being twice cropped), grain crops occupied 127,032 acres; pulses, 42,444; and oil-seeds, 22 t 238.
