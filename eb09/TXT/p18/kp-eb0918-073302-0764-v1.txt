PHERECRATES, one of the chief poets of the Old Attic Comedy, was a contemporary of Cratinus, Crates, and Aristophanes, being older than the last and younger than the two former. At first an actor, he seems to have gained a prize for a play in 438 b.c. The only other ascertained date in his life is 420, when he produced his play The Wild Men. Like Crates, whom he imitated, he abandoned personal satire for more general themes. Still in some of the fragments of his plays we find him attacking Alcibiades and others. He was especially famed for his inventive imagination, and the elegance and purity of his diction are attested by the epithet dτ∏κωτατos (“most Attic”) applied to him by Athenaeus and the sophist Phrynichus. However, Meineke has shown from his remains that his language deviated considerably from the standard observed by the other comic poets of the day. There is genuine feeling in his address to old age (preserved by Stobaeus, Flor., 116, 12). He was the inventor of a new metre, which was called, after him, Pherecratean,^[1. — — | — ⏑ ⏑ | — —, or, as it may be otherwise divided, — — | — ⏑ ⏑ — | — .] and frequently occurs in the choruses of Greek tragedies and in Horace.

Pherecrates is variously stated by ancient authorities to have composed eighteen and sixteen plays; Meineke reduces the list of his undoubted plays to thirteen. None of them are extant, but a considerable number of fragments have been preserved. These are given in Meineke, Fragmenta Comicorum Graecorum, vol. ii. (1839), and in Bothe, Frag. Com. Gr. (Paris, 1855).
