PANNA, or Punnah, a native state in Bundelkhand, India, situated for the most part on the table-lands above the Vindhyan Gh√¢ts, and containing much hill and jungle land, with an area of 2568 square miles, and a population in 1881 of 227,306. The state was formerly celebrated for its diamond mines in the neighbourhood of Panna town, but these appear to have become almost exhausted, and only a small and fluctuating revenue is now derived from them.
