PHILLIPS, Thomas (1770-1845), portrait and subject painter, was born at Dudley in Warwickshire on 18th October 1770. Having acquired the art of glass-painting at Birmingham, he visited London in 1790 with an introduction to Benjamin West, who found him employment on the windows in St George’s chapel at Windsor. In 1792 Phillips painted a view of Windsor Castle, and ere the two succeeding years had passed he exhibited the Death of Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, at the Battle of Castillon, Ruth and Naomi, Elijah restoring the Widow’s Son, Cupid disarmed by Euphrosyne, and other pictures of that class. From the year 1796, however, he seems to have mainly confined himself to portrait-painting; and it was in this walk that he was destined to acquire his reputation as an artist. It was not long before he became the chosen painter of men of genius and talent, notwithstanding the rivalry of Hoppner, Owen, Jackson, and Lawrence; and he has left behind him portraits of nearly all the illustrious characters of his day. His works of this kind are distinguished by simplicity, careful and finished handling, and truth of portraiture, but in colour they are commonly cold and feeble. In 1804 he was elected associate and four years later member of the Royal Academy. In 1824 Phillips succeeded Fuseli as professor of painting to the Royal Academy, an office which he held till 1832. During this period he delivered ten Lectures on the History and Principles of Painting, which were published in 1833. He likewise wrote a large number of the articles on the fine arts in Rees’s Cyclopaedia. He died on the 20th of April 1845.
