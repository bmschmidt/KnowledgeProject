PARSON is a technical term of English law, and is a corruption of persona, the parson being, as it were, the persona ecclesiae, or representative of the church in the parish. Parson imparsonee (persona impersonate) is he that as rector is in possession of a church parochial, and of whom the church is full, whether it be presentative or impropriate (Coke upon Littleton, 300 b). The word parson is properly used only of a rector, though it is sometimes loosely extended to any one in holy orders. Though every parson is a rector, every rector is not a parson. A parson must be in holy orders; hence a lay rector could not be called a parson. The parson is tenant for life of the parsonage house, the glebe, the tithes, and other dues, so far as they are not appropriated. Further information on this subject will be found under Advowson, Benefice, and Tithes.
