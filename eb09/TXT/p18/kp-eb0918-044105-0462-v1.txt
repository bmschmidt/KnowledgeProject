PEABODY, a town of the United States, in Essex county, Massachusetts, 5 miles north-west of Salem. Incorporated as South Danvers in 1855, it adopted its present name in 1868 in honour of the philanthropist George Peabody, who was born in the township, and in 1852 erected there the Peabody Institute, which now contains various memorials of its founder, the portrait of herself presented by Queen Victoria, the Congress medal, &c. Peabody contains a large number of leather and morocco factories, and several glue-works, print-works, &c. Its inhabitants numbered 7343 in 1870 and 9028 in 1880.
