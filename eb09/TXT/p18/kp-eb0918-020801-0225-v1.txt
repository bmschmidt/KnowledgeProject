PANAeTIUS, a Stoic philosopher, lived about 185-112 B.c. He belonged to a Rhodian family, but was probably educated partly in Pergamum and afterwards in Athens. About 156 B.c. he came from Athens to Rome, -where he became a friend of Laelius and of Scipio the younger. He lived as a guest in the house of Scipio, and accompanied him in his final campaign against Carthage and in his expedition to Egypt and Asia, 143 B.c. He had an important influence in the introduction of Greek philosophy into Rome, and taught a number of distinguished Romans. He returned to Athens, probably after the murder of Scipio in 129 B.c., and succeeded Antipater as head of the Stoic school. The right of citizenship was offered him by the Athenians, but not accepted. In his teaching he laid most stress on ethics; and his most important works, of which only insignificant fragments are preserved, were on this subject. He wrote (apparently during his Roman visit) a treatise on virtue, ττ∈pi τον καθήκοντος, in three books, upon which Cicero has chiefly founded his work De Officiis. Works ιrepι προνοιάς, ττeρl evθυμ,iaς, <fcc., were also composed by Panaetius.
