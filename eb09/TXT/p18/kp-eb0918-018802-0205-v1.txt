PALLADIUS, Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus, a writer of the 4th century after Christ, author of a poem on agriculture (De Re Rustica) in fourteen books. It is not certain whether he can be identified with any known historical person of the time. His work consists of an introductory book of general directions on agriculture, twelve books describing the operations suitable for the twelve months of the year, and a final book on the cultivation of trees. The material is derived from Columella and other earlier writers. The work was popular in the Middle Ages; it is conveniently arranged, but far inferior in every other respect to that of Columella.
