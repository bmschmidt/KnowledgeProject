PASTORAL LETTER, a letter addressed, in his pastoral capacity, by a bishop to his clergy, or the laity of his diocese, or both. In the Church of Rome it is usual for every bishop to issue at least one pastoral annually, the Lenten Mandates or Instructions, containing exhortations relating to that fast, and enumerating the dispensations granted and devotions prescribed. Others are issued in connexion with the principal solemnities of the church, or as occasion arises.
