PADIHAM, a township of Lancashire, is situated in a wild and dreary district on the precipitous banks of the Calder, and on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, 5 miles south-east from Whalley and 4 north-east from Accrington. It possesses large cotton mills, and both stone and coal are wrought in the immediate neighbourhood. The church of St Leonard, founded before 1451, was frequently altered before it was rebuilt in 1866-68, in the Perpendicular style, at a cost of Â£11,000. There is a national school connected with a very old endowment. Padiham in 1251 was a manor in the possession of Edmund de Laci. The population of the urban sanitary district of Padiham and Hapton (area 950 acres) in 1871 was estimated at 7361, and in 1881 it was 8974.
