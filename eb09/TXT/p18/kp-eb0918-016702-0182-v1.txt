PALAZZOLO (often P.-Acreide to distinguish it from several other places of the same name), a city of Italy, in the province of Syracuse, Sicily, 28 miles west of Syracuse, with a population of 11,069 according to the census of 1881. It is mainly of interest on account of the remains it still preserves of the ancient city of Acrae, which was founded by Syracuse in 663 b.c. These consist of a temple, an aqueduct, a theatre with a fine view towards Etna, a smaller theatre or odeum, a group of thirteen cisterns, and, in the vicinity, various rows of rock-cut tombs, from which a rich harvest of vases, &c., was obtained by Baron Judica, the great explorer of the site. See Judica, Antichit√† di Acre.
