PETER the Hermit, the apostle of the first crusade, was born of good family, it is supposed, in the diocese of Amiens about the year 1050. His early history is obscure, but he appears to have seen some military service under the counts of Boulogne before his withdrawal from the world as a hermit. His crusading zeal originated in a pilgrimage he made to the Holy Sepulchre shortly before 1094, in which year he began to preach in the transalpine countries the immediate deliverance of Jerusalem from the infidel (see Crusades, vol. vi. p. 623 sqf After the failure of the expedition headed by him in 1096, he founded and became first prior of the abbey of Neuf-moustier at Huy in the diocese of Li√®ge, where he died on 7th July 1115.
