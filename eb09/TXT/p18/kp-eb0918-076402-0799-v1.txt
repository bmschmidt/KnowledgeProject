PHILO BYBLIUS, i.e., Philo of Byblus (Gebal, Jubeil), was born, according to Suidas, in 42 a.d., and lived into the reign of Hadrian, about which he wrote a book now wholly lost. He was a grammarian by profession and author of many books, of which those oftenest cited are: (1) a work About Cities and the Famous Men they have pro duced, which was epitomized by Serenus, and (2) Phoenician History. Of the latter there are very considerable fragments, chiefly preserved by Eusebius in the Praeparatio Euangelica, and presenting a Euhemeristic rechauffe of Phoenician theology and mythology which is represented as translated from the Phoenician of Sanchuniathon. The fragments of Philo are collected in Müller, Fr. Hist. Gr., iii. 560 sq. To the literature there cited add Ewald’s essay in the Abhandlungen of the Royal Society of Göttingen, vol. v. (1853); Renan’s in Mem. Acad, des Inscript., vol. xxiii. (1858); and Baudissin, Studien zur semitischen Ileligions- geschichte, i. 3 sq.
