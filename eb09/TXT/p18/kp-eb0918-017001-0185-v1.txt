PALES, an old Italian deity, worshipped in the festival of the Palilia at Rome on the 21st April. Like most of the ancient Italian deities, Pales is little more than a name to us; the authorities are at variance whether the name belonged to a goddess or to a god. In this festival Pales was invoked to grant protection and increase to flocks and herds; the worshippers entreated forgiveness for any unintentional profanation of holy places of which they might have been guilty, and sprang through fires of straw as a purificatory rite. The German Maifeuer, which remained in use till a very recent date, was a precisely similar custom; the intention was to propitiate the wrath of the deity for any neglect of her service before the summer began, and so ensure her favour to the flocks. The foundation of Rome, dies natalis Romae, was commemorated on this same day,â€”a custom still kept up. The name Palilia is often written, by dissimilation, Parilia.
