PAKHOI, or Peihai, a city and port of China, in the west of the province of Kwang-tung, situated on a bay of the Gulf of Tong-king, formed by a peninsula running south-west from the fu city of Lien-chow, in 21° 30' N. lat. and 109° 10' E. long. Dating only from about 1820-30, and at first little better than a nest of pirates, Pakhoi rapidly grew into commercial importance, owing partly to the complete freedom which it enjoyed from taxation, and partly to the diversion of trade produced by the Tai-ping rebellion. The establishment of a Chinese custom-house, and the opening of the ports of Hankow and Haiphong, for a time threatened to injure its prospects; but, foreign trade being permitted in 1876-77, it began in 1879 to be regularly visited by foreign steamers. The average value of the open trade between 1880 and 1882 was £475,000 per annum, and a great deal of smuggling still takes place. Liquid iιfdigo, sugar, aniseed and aniseed oil, cassia-lignea and cassia oil, cuttle-fish, and hides are the chief exports. With Macao especially an extensive junk trade is carried on, £77,000 worth of [9:18:142] goods being despatched for Pakhoi in the course of a year. A large number of the inhabitants (who exceed 10,000 in all) are engaged in fishing and fish-curing.
