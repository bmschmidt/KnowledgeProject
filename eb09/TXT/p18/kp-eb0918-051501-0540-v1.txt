PENZA, capital of the above province, is situated 440 miles by rail south-east from Moscow. It is mostly built of wood, on the slopes of a plateau 730 feet above the sea, at the confluence of the little Penza with the navigable Sura. The Spasopreobrajensky cathedral was built in the end of the 17th century, the monastery of the same name, which formerly adjoined it, being now in the suburbs. A few educational and philanthropic institutions, a theatre which has played some part in the history of the Russian stage, and a municipal bank are the chief buildings of Penza, which derives its importance chiefly from its being the seat of the provincial authorities and the see of a bishop. The great bulk of the inhabitants are peasants, who support themselves by agriculture or fishing in the Sura, some artisans, and a few merchants. An imperial botanical garden is situated within 2 miles of the town. Apart from a paper-mill and two steam flour-mills, the manufacturing establishments (producing soap, candles, wax-candles, cosmetics, machinery), distilleries, breweries, and saw-mills are small. Trade in corn, oil, tallow, and spirits is on the increase. There are two fairs where cattle and horses are sold for export, grocery and manufactured wares being the corresponding imports. The population in 1881 had reached 41,650.
