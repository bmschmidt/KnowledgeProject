PARAHYBA, or Paraiba, distinguished as Parahyba do Norte from Parahyba do Sul or S. Joâo de Parahyba to the south of Rio de Janeiro, is a city of Brazil on the right bank of the river of the same name, 12 miles from the sea, at the terminus of a railway running 87 miles into the interior. It is divided into a lower commercial town and an upper town containing the governor’s residence and other public buildings. From December to March the climate is not considered healthy. The harbour, obstructed by several reefs, has a depth of 15 feet, but vessels ground at low water; there is safe anchorage, however, at Cabedello at the mouth of the river. The population, which was 40,000 about 1845, has decreased to between 12,000 and 14,000, and direct trade with Europe has been given up since 1840. Sugar, cotton, and india-rubber are still exported.
