PALLIUM, PALLA. These articles of Roman dress, corresponding to the Greek himation, are described in the article Costume (vol. vi. pp. 453, 456-57), where also the pallium, as an ecclesiastical vestment peculiar to archbishops in the Roman Church, has been spoken of (pp. 461, 463). In the East the pallium is worn by all bishops, and one or two instances have occurred in the Western Church also in which it has been conferred by the pope on prelates of less than archiépiscopal rank. The canon law forbids archbishops to wear this vestment until it has been solemnly asked for (either personally or by deputy) and obtained from the holy see; even then it is only to be worn on certain specified occasions, such as at high pontifical mass or at an episcopal consecration. Every archbishop must apply for it within three months after his consecration, and it is buried with him at his death. The pallium is never granted until after payment of considerable dues. The pallia are prepared by nuns from white wool obtained from lambs which have been consecrated on St Agnes’s eve in the church of that saint in Rome; the vestments are blessed on the festival of Saints Peter and Paul, and deposited for a night on the altar over St Peter’s tomb; they are afterwards taken charge of by the subdeacon, and given out as required. The groλvth of the occasional practice of bestowing the pallium into an invariable custom, and of the custom into a law, will be traced in the article Popedom.
