PETROPOLIS, a town of Brazil, in the province of Rio de Janeiro, lies at a height of 2400 feet above the sea on a beautiful and healthy plateau, surrounded by the wooded heights of the Serra da Estrella, which lie between it and the coast region. It is about 25 miles almost due north from Rio de Janeiro, and is reached by a railway (22 miles) from Maua; the last 10âˆ£ miles are on the Rigi system. Founded by the emperor of Brazil as a colony for distressed German immigrants, Petropolis has grown into an elegant and thriving town of 8000 or 10,000 inhabitants, and, besides the royal palace and park, has a number of good hotels and public buildings.
