PARMENIO (∏αpp,ειzιωι∕), a distinguished Macedonian general, born about 400 b.c., was the son of Philotas, and first appears in history as a favourite counsellor of Philip, in the course of whose reign he obtained a great victory over the Illyrians (356 B.c.), successfully upheld, at the head of an army, the Macedonian influence in Eubaea (342), and was appointed one of the commanders of the force that was sent to secure a footing in Asia, and to prepare for the future reduction of that country (336 b.c.). His influence became still greater in the succeeding reign; at Alexander’s council table he was always heard with deference, and in the field he was virtually second in command. He led the left wing of the army in the battles of the Granicus, Issus, and Arbela; and, while the king himself continued the pursuit of Darius into the wastes of Parthia and Hyrcania, Parmenio was entrusted with the task of completing the conquest of Media. Here he was stabbed by Cleander at the instance of the king, in 330, under circumstances which have been elsewhere described (see Alexander, vol. i. p. 483).
