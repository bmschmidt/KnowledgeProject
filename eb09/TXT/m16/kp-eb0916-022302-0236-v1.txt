MEZÖ-TÚR,^[1. Mezδ is a Magyar word, signifying Field, prefixed to many agricultural localities in Hungary.] a corporate town in the Cis-Tisian county of Jâsz-Nagy-Kun-Szolnok, Hungary, situated on the right bank of the Berettyo, and on the railway from Arad to Szolnok, in 47° 1' N. lat., 20° 39' E. long. It has Roman Catholic and Calvinist churches and schools, a judicial court for the circuit, and the usual Government offices, but can boast of few buildings of special interest. Horses, oxen, and sheep are reared in great numbers on the wide-spreading communal lands, which are productive also of cereals, and especially wheat, rape-seed, and maize. On the 31st December 1880 the population amounted to 20,649 (10,265 males, 10,384 females), mostly Magyars by nationality.
