MILFORD, a seaport, market-town, and contributory parliamentary borough (one of the Pembroke district) of Pembrokeshire, South Wales, is finely situated on the north side of Milford Haven, about 8 miles westnorth-west of Pembroke. The land-locked estuary of Milford Haven stretches about 10 miles inland, with a [9:16:295] breadth of from 1 to 2 miles. In most places it has a depth of from lÎ´ to 19 fathoms, and, as it is completely sheltered by hills, vessels can ride in it at anchor in all kinds of weather. The royal dockyard, founded at Milford in 1790, was removed in 1811, and from that time trade has been in a languishing condition. The town possesses iron-works. The shipping trade is confined chiefly to coasting vessels, but with the completion of new docks, capable of receiving vessels of the largest tonnage, it is supposed that a considerable trade may be carried on with America. The population of the urban sanitary district in 1871 was 3252, and in 1881 it was 3813.
