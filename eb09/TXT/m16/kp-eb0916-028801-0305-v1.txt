MIEDZYRZECZ PODLASKI (Russian, Mejirye,chie), a district town of Russian Poland, in the government of Siedlce, 16 miles to the east of the government capital, on the railway between Warsaw and Brest-Litovskiy. It is first mentioned in the year 1390 as a feudal dominion of King Yaghello. After frequently changing hands it became the property of the Czartoryski, and afterwards of the Potocki family, whose palace is still to be seen in the town. Its 10,000 inhabitants—half of whom are Greek nonconformists, and half Jews and Poles—carry on some trade in bristles, and pursue minor industries.
