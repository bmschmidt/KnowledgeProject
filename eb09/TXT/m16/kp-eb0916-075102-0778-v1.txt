MONITION, in the practice of the English ecclesiastical courts, is an order requiring or admonishing the person complained of to do something specified in the monition, “under pain of the law and penalty thereof.” It is the lightest form of ecclesiastical censure, but disobedience to it, after it has been duly and regularly served, entails the penalties of contempt of court. See Phillimore, Ecclesiastical Law (London, 1873).
