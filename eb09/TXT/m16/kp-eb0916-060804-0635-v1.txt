MOḲADDASÍ. Shams al-Dfπ Abù AbdalL4h Mohammed ibπ Ahmad al-Mokaddasf, i.e., of Jerusalem, also called al-Bashsharf, was the author of a famous description of the lands of Islam, which much surpasses the earlier works of the same kind. His paternal grandfather was an architect of eminence, who constructed many public works in Palestine, and his mother’s family was opulent. He was himself a well-educated and talented man, with an exorbitant idea of his own qualities, and some curious affectations, such as that of imitating for each region the dialect of its inhabitants. His descriptions rest on very extensive travels continued through a long series of years. His first pilgrimage was made at the age of twenty, but his book was not published till a.h. 375 (985-6 a.d.), when he was forty years old. The two MSS. (at Berlin and Constantinople) represent a later recension (a.h. 378). The book became known in Europe through the copy brought from India by Sprenger, and was edited by De Goeje in 1877 as the third part of his Biblioth. Geographorwm Arabicorum.
