MOLINE, a city of the United States, in Rock Island county, Illinois, is situated in a picturesque district on the left bank of the Mississippi, opposite the upper end of Rock Island. First settled in 1832, the town was organized as a city in 1872. It is noted for its water-power, developed and maintained by the Government, and for the number and importance of its manufacturing establishments. By means of a dam nearly a mile in length, from the Illinois shore to the island, an almost uniform head of 7 feet of water is obtained, which is used in driving the machinery of the Government arsenal on the island, and in supplying power to several factories. Beds of bituminous coal are mined in the neighbourhood, and three lines of railway pass through the city, affording with the river ample means of communication. The most prominent manufactures are agricultural implements and machinery generally, waggons, organs, paper, and stoves. ' Moline has nine churches, a complete system of graded free schools, including a high school, and a free library. The population increased from 4066 in 1870 to 7805 in 1880, and with the suburbs the number is now estimated at 12,000.
