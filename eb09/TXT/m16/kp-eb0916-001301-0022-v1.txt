MENSHIKOFF, Alexander Sergeievich (1787-1869), great-grandson of Peter’s favourite, born in 1787, entered the Russian service as attaché to the embassy at Vienna. He accompanied the emperor Alexander throughout his campaigns against Napoleon, and attained the rank of general, but retired from active service in 1823. He then devoted himself to naval matters, and put the Russian marine, which had fallen into decay during the reign of Alexander, on an efficient footing. On the outbreak of the Crimean War he was appointed commander-in-chief, and suffered a severe defeat at the Alma. On the death of the emperor Nicholas in 1855 he was recalled, ostensibly on account of failing health. He died in 1869.
