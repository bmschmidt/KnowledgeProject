MILO was the surname of T. Annius Papianus, one of the best-known of the partisan leaders and ruffians in the stormy times that preceded the dissolution of the Roman republic. His father was C. Papius Celsus, but he was adopted by his mother’s father T. Annius Luscus. He joined the Pompeian party, and led the band of mercenaries and gladiators which was required to defend the cause and its chief supporters in the public streets. P. Clodius, the leader of the ruffians who professed the democratic cause, was his personal enemy, and their brawls in the streets and their mutual accusations in the law courts lasted for several years, beginning when Milo was tribune of the commons in 57 B.c. In 53 their quarrels came to a height when Milo was candidate for the consulship and Clodius for the praetorship; and when the two leaders met by accident on the Appian Way at Bovillae, Clodius was murdered (January 20, 52 B.c.). This act of violence strengthened the hands of Pompey, who was nominated sole consul, and proposed several stringent laws to restore order in the city. Milo was impeached; his guilt was clear, and his enemies took every means of intimidating his supporters and his judges. Cicero was afraid to deliver the speech he had prepared Pro Milone, and the extant oration is an expanded form of the unspoken defence. Milo went into exile at Massilia, and his property was sold by auction. He joined the insurrection of Μ. Caelius in 48 B.c., and was soon slain near Thurii in Lucania. His wife Fausta was daughter of the dictator Sulla.
