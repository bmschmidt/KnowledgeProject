MONTSERRAT, one of the Leeward Islands in the West Indies, situated 16° 45' N. lat. and 62° 7' W. long., is 12 miles long and 8 broad in its widest part, and has an area of 32 square miles. The uneven and rugged surface suggests possibly volcanic origin. Its general appearance is very picturesque, the most interesting natural feature being the Souffrière. The island was discovered by Columbus in 1493, and received its name either because of its broken appearance or after the mountain in Spain. It was colonized by the English under Sir Thomas Warner in 1632, and was taken by the French in 1664. Restored to the English in 1668, it capitulated to the French in 1782, but was again restored in 1784. It is now a presidency under the general government at Antigua, and has a legislative council, composed of officials and crown nominees. The climate is the most healthy in the West Indies. The population (10,087) consists principally of negroes, with several hundred whites. The revenue and expenditure average £5600 per annum. Sugar exports range from 1200 to occasionally 2000 tons. An important industry is the cultivation of limes and the manufacture of juice. About 700 puncheons of raw lime juice, 300 hogsheads of concentrated juice, and an increasing quantity of fresh green limes are exported annually. For the three years ending 1880 the average value of imports was £26,390, of exports £32,963. The principal town is Plymouth, lying midway along the south-west coast.
