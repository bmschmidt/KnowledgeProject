MONROE, a city of the United States, county seat of Monroe county, Michigan, lies 32 miles south-south-west of Detroit, on both banks of the Raisin river, 3 miles inland from Lake Erie, with which it has been connected by a ship-canal since 1843. It is a station on the Canada Southern, the Flint and PÃ¨re Marquette, and the Detroit division of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railways. Agricultural implement factories, a spoke and hub factory, foundries and engineering-works, carriage-works, grist-mills, paper-mills, and fruit-drying establishments are in operation. From 400 to 500 tons of grapes are shipped yearly from the neighbouring vineyards, and over 100,000 gallons of wine are made here. The population in 1880 was 4928. Settled as Frenchtown by a body of Canadians in 1784, Monroe received its present name, in honour of President Monroe, in 1817. Its city charter dates from 1837. It was the scene of the battle of the river Raisin, 2 2d January 1813.
