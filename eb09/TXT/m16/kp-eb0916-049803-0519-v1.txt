MIRAMON, Miguel, a Mexican soldier of French extraction, was born in the city of Mexico, September 29, 1832, and shot along with the emperor Maximilian at Queretaro, June 19, 1867. While still a student he helped to defend the military academy at Chapultepec against the forces of the United States; and, entering the army in 1852, he rapidly came to the front during the civil wars that disturbed the country. It was largely due to Miramonâ€™s support of the ecclesiastical party against Alvarez and Comonfort that Zuloagawas raised to the presidency; and in 1859 he was called to succeed him in that office. Decisively beaten, however, by the Liberals, he fled the country in 1860, and spent some time in Europe earnestly advocating foreign intervention in Mexican affairs; and when he returned it was as a partisan of Maximilian. His ability as a soldier was best shown by his double defence of Puebla in 1856.
