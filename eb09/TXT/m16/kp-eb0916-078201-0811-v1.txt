MONTEREY, a city of Mexico, capital of the state of Nuevo Leon, lies 1600 feet above the sea on a sub-tributary of the Rio Grande del Norte, 150 miles south-south-west of Nuevo Laredo, and 190 west-south-west of Matamoras. A handsome and well-planned city, with a cathedral and a number of good public buildings, Monterey is also in commercial and manufacturing activity the most important place in the northern parts of the republic, and one of the principal stations on the railway opened in 1882 between the city of Mexico and the United States frontier (at Matamoras and Nuevo Laredo). The population was about 37,000 in 1880. The city was founded in 1596, became a bishopric in 1777, and was captured by the United States forces under General Taylor in September 1846.
