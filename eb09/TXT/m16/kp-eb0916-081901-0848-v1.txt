MOREAU, Hégésippe, a minor lyric poet of disputed but considerable talent, was born at Paris on the 9th April 1810, and died in the hospital of La Charité on the 10th December 1838. In his early youth his parents, who were very ill-off, migrated to Provins, where the mother went into service and the father took the post of usher in a public school. Both died in the same refuge for the destitute which afterwards received their son. Hégésippe was fairly educated and was apprenticed to a printer, but he preferred the work (in France usually paid most miserably) of “maître d’études” in a school. He went to Paris before 1830, and appears to have practised both his occupations there, though for the most part he either adopted by choice or was driven by ill-fortune to adopt the singular life of alternate hardship and cheap dissipation which is dignified in France by the name of Bohemianism. In Moreau’s case there is no doubt that the hardships exceeded the dissipation. He was habitually houseless, and is said to have exposed himself to the dangers of a cholera hospital in the great epidemic of 1832 simply to obtain shelter and food. Then he revisited Provins and published a kind of satirical serial called Diogène. Some years of this life entirely ruined his health, and it was only just before his death that he succeeded in getting his collected poems published, selling the copyright for <£4 sterling and eighty copies of the book. It was received not unfavourably, but, as has happened in other cases, the author’s death, which happened soon in the circumstances mentioned, was required to excite an interest which was proportionately excessive. Moreau’s work, like that of many other young poets, has a strong note of imitation, his model being especially Béranger; and his character, both moral and literary, is not improved by obvious affectation in political, religious, and social matters. But some of his poems, such as La Voιdzie and the charming La Fermière, have great sweetness, and he had a faculty of writing both in prose and poetry which seems to show that with better fortune, or, to speak honestly, with more intelligence and more perseverance he might easily have saved himself from the miserable destitution which was his lot.
