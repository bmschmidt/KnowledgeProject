MICHAEL (⅛3'P, “who is like God?”) appears in the Old Testament as a man’s name, synonymous with Micaiah or Micah. In the book of Daniel the same name is given to one of the chief “princes” of the heavenly host, the guardian angel or “prince” of Israel (Dan. x. 13, 21; xii. 1), and as such he naturally appears in Jewish theosophy as the greatest of all angels, the first of the four who surround the throne of God (see Gabriel). It is as guardian angel of Israel, or of the church, the true Israel, that Michael appears in Jude 9 and Rev. xii. 7. In the Western Church the festival of St Michael and All Angels (Michaelmas) is celebrated on September 29th; it appears to have grown out of a local celebration of the dedication of a church of St Michael either at Mount Garganus in Apulia or at Rome, and was a great day by the beginning of the 9th century. The Greek Church dedicates November 8 to St Michael, St Gabriel, and All Angels.
