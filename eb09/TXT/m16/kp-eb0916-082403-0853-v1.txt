MORHOF, Daniel Georg (1639-1691), the learned author of a survey of universal literature entitled Polyhistor sive de auctorum notitia et rerum commentarii, was born at Wismar in 1639, studied law at Rostock, and was appointed professor of poetry there in 1660. In 1665 he went to the new university of Kiel as professor of eloquence and poetry; this chair he exchanged for that of history in 1673. He died at LÃ¼beck in 1691. Of his numerous writings only the Polyhistor continues to be of value to the literary historian as a bibliographical work displaying judgment as well as knowledge. The first seven books (Polyhistor Literarius} appeared in 1688-1698; the publication of the two remaining parts (P. Philosophicus and P. Practicus} was completed by Moller in 1707. The best edition is that of A. Fabricius (2 vols. 4to, Leipsic, 1747).
