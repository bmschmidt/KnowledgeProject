MONTILLA, a small and unimportant city of Spain in [9:16:791] the province of Cordova, 32 miles to the south of the city of Cordova, on the Malaga railway, is strikingly situated on two hills which command a beautiful and extensive prospect of the surrounding country. The manufactures (principally weaving) are unimportant, and the trade of the place is chiefly in agricultural produce. The oil of the surrounding district is abundant and good; and it is the peculiar flavour of the pale dry light wine of Montilla that gives its name to the sherry known as Amontillado. The population in 1878 was 13,207. Montilla was the birthplace of “The Great Captain,” and still shows the ruins of the castle of his father, Don Pedro Fernandez de Cordova.
