MOGILAS, Petrus (c. 1600-1647), metropolitan of Kieff from 1632, belonged to a noble Wallachian family, and was born about the year 1600. He studied for some time at the university of Paris, and first became a monk in 1625. He was the author of a Catechism, (Kieff, 1645) and other minor works, but is principally celebrated for the Orthodox Confession, drawn up at his instance by the abbot Kosslowski of Kieff, approved at a provincial synod in 1640, and accepted by the patriarchs of Constantinople, Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch in 1642-3, and by the synod of Jerusalem in 1672. See Greek Church, vol. xi. p. 158.

There are numerous editions of the Confession in Russian; it has been edited in Greek and Latin by Panagiotes (Amsterdam, 1662), by Hofmann (Leipsic, 1695), and by Kimmel (Jena, 1843), and there is a German translation by Frisch (Frankfort, 1727).
