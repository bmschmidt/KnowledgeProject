MONTE SANT ’ ANGELO, a city of Italy in the province of Foggia (Capitanata), 10 miles north of Manfredonia, stands on an offshoot of Monte Gargano 2824 feet high. In 491 the archangel Michael pointed out the place to St Laurentius, archbishop of Sipontum (Manfredonia), and the chapel, which was built over the cave, to which he drew more particular attention, soon became a famous place of pilgrimage. Though plundered by the Lombards in 657, and by the Saracens in 869, St Michael’s was already a wealthy sanctuary in the 11th century, and its prosperity continued till the time of the French occupation. The canons (Canonici Garganici, as they are usually called) maintained a prolonged contest with the Sipontine archbishops for episcopal independence. According to Ughelli (Italia Sacra, vol. vii. p. 816), a marble statue of the saint by Michelangelo Buonarroti took the place of a silver image. The bronze doors still preserved are fine pieces of Byzantine work, made, as an inscription bears witness, in Constantinople in 1076. The town of Sant’ Angelo, which had only about 3000 inhabitants in the 17th century, numbered 14,759 in 1861, and 13,902 in 1871. Besides the festival of the saint celebrated on the 9th of May, there is a great fair on the 29th of September.
