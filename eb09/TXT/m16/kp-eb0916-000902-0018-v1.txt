MENDOZA, a city of the Argentine Republic, the only town of the province of Mendoza, lies 700 miles westnorth-west of Buenos Ayres, at the foot of the Cordilleras, 2510 feet above the sea-level, in 32° 53' S. lat. and 68° 45' W. long. It was formerly a frequent stopping-place on the route across the Andes by the Uspallata Pass, and used to rank as one of the best-built towns in the country, but in 1861 it was almost completely destroyed by an appalling earthquake, in which the people, for the most part collected in the churches, perished to the number of about 12,000. Bravard, a French geologist who had often predicted the catastrophe, was one of those who perished. Extensive ruins still mark the site of the old town; the new town, which has been built at a little distance, has grown rapidly. Situated in a richly cultivated district, Mendoza depends mainly on agriculture and fruit-growing.

The city was founded in 1559 by Garcia de Mendoza; and in 1776 it was made the administrative centre of the vice-royalty of La Plata. See Mulhall, Handbook of the La Plata States, 1875; and Mrs Mulhall, Between the Amazon and the Andes, 1882.
