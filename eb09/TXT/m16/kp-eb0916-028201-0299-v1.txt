MIDDLETON, a market and manufacturing town of Lancashire, is situated on the Irk, near the Rochdale Canal, and on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, about 5 miles north of Manchester and 4 west of Oldham. It includes the township of Tonge, an isolated portion of the parish of Prestwich. The church of St Leonards is an old structure of mixed architecture, with a low square tower. The oldest portion of the building dates from the 12 th century, but the main portion from 1412, and the south aisle from 1524. It underwent extensive restoration in 1869. The Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, a building in the Tudor style, was founded in 1572. There are public baths and a free library. The prosperity of the town dates from the introduction of manufactures at the close of last century. The staple trade is the spinning and weaving of cotton, and the other industries include silk weaving, calico printing, bleaching, dyeing, ironfounding, and the manufacture of soap and chemicals. There are several collieries in the neighbourhood. The town was at an early period in possession of the Bartons, from whom it passed by marriage in the 16th century to Sir Ralph de Assheton. The population of the urban sanitary district of Middleton and Tonge in 1881 was 18,952.
