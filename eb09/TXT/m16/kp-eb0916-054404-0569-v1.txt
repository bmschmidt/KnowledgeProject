MOHACS, a market town in the Trans-Danubian county of Baranya, Hungary, stands on the right bank of the west arm of the Danube, 25 miles east-south-east of Pécs (Fünfkirchen), with which it is connected by railway, 45° 58' N. lat., 18° 37' E. long. At Mohdcs there are several churches and schools belonging both to the Roman Catholics and the Calvinists, also the summer palace of the bishop of Pécs, a monastery, an old castle, and a station for steamers plying on the Danube, by which means a considerable •commerce in wine and the agricultural produce of the neighbourhood is carried on with Budapest and Vienna. Not far from Mohâcs are coal mines, and the town is an important coal depot of the Danubian Steam Navigation Company. The population in 1880 was 12,047 (Magyars, Serbs, and Germans).

Two great battles fought in the vicinity of the town mark the commencement and close of the Turkish dominion in Hungary. In the first, 29th August 1526, the Hungarian army under Louis II. was annihilated by the Ottoman forces led by Soliman the Magnificent (see vol. xii. p. 369). In the second, 12th August 1687, the Austrians under Charles of Lorraine gained a great and decisive victory over the Turks, whose power was afterwards still further broken by Prince Eugene of Savoy.
