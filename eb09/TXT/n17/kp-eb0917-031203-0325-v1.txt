NECTARINE, a fruit differing from the peach in having a smooth or glabrous skin instead of a downy one. The varieties of nectarine, too, have often a distinct flavour from that of the peaches. The common origin of the peach and nectarine is shown, however, by the facts that seeds of the one will often reproduce the other, and that fruits of both kinds have not unfrequently been met with on the same branch. For cultivation see Horticulture, vol. xii. p. 272.
