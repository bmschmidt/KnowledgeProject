NEU-BRANDENBURG, a flourishing town in Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Germany, situated on a small lake called the Tollenser-See, about 60 miles to the west of Stettin. It is still partly surrounded with walls, and possesses four interesting old Gothic gates, dating from 1304. The principal buildings are the Marienkirche, a Gothic building of the 14th century, the synagogue, the town-house, and the gymnasium. Iron-founding, machine-making, woolspinning, and the making of paper, tobacco, and musical [9:17:361] instruments are carried on here, and the trade in wool and agricultural products is very considerable. The horse fair is also important. Neu-Brandenburg was founded in 1248, and has belonged to Mecklenburg since 1292. The population in 1880 was 8406.
