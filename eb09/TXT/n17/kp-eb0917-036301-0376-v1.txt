NEU-MÜNSTER, a town of Prussia, in the province of Schleswig-Holstein, district of Kiel, lies on both banks of the small river Schale, in the basin of the Stör. It is the centre of the railway system of Holstein, and after Altona the most important industrial town in the province, containing upwards of seventy cloth-factories, besides manufactories of cotton, wadding, carpets, paper, and bonbons. Its trade is also brisk. The name is derived from an Augustine monastery, founded by Vicelin, and mentioned as “Novum Monasterium” in a document of 1136. Its industrial importance began in the 17th century, when the cloth-workers of Segeberg, a town to the south-east, migrated to it. In 1880 it contained 11,623 inhabitants, almost exclusively Protestant.
