NESTOR, the old warrior of the Iliad, the wise councillor of the Greek leaders, was the son of Neleus and Chloris. He succeeded his father as king of Pylus. In the Iliad he is represented as too old to be of use in battle, but always ready to give advice and counsel to the younger warriors, and to entertain them with long accounts of his own exploits in his youth. According to Homer, he had ruled over three generations of men, and was wise as the immortal gods. In the Odyssey he is described as still ruling over Pylus, where he is visited by Telemachus. There is no real connexion between the legends of Nestor and those of Neleus; but, as the former belonged to Pylus, the legend is bound to place him in genealogical relation with the representative king of the land.
