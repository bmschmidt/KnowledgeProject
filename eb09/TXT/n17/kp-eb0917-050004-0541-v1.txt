NIJNI-LOMOFF, a district town of Russia, in the government of Penza, 69 miles west-north-west from the capital of the government, on the Lomoff; the railway from Penza to Tula passes within 17 miles. It was founded as a south-eastern frontier fort in 1636, in a country of moderate fertility, and has but slowly developed. It has now 19,000 inhabitants, who support themselves chiefly by agriculture and gardening. The merchants carry on trade in grain, wine-spirit, hempseed oil, leather, woollen goods, and a variety of wooden wares (cars, sledges, wheels, and so on), largely manufactured in the southern and wooded part of the district. The yearly fair is of some importance as regards corn and cattle. The town and the district have also a few distilleries, manufactures of woollen cloth and potash, oil-works, and potteries.
