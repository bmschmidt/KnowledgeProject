NEMESIUS, a Christian philosopher, author of a treatise On Human Nature, was, according to the title of his book, bishop of Emesa (in Syria); of his life nothing further is known, and even his date is uncertain, but most probably he flourished towards the close of the 4th century. Theologically, and especially as regards his christology, he is usually claimed by the orthodox; but his views as to the pre-existence of the soul and a modified metempsychosis are more Platonic than catholic, and his leaning towards the doctrine of the world’s eternity is difficult to reconcile with what, afterwards at least, came to be the teaching of the church. One or two of his physiological expositions have occasionally been quoted, very irrelevantly, to show that Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of the blood had been anticipated at that early age. Nemesius is frequently quoted by later writers of the Eastern Church, such as Joh. Damascenus. His writings have sometimes been attributed to Gregory of Nyssa. The editio princeps of the τr∈pι <∕>υσ∈ωs άνθρωπον appeared at Antwerp in 1565; the work has more than once been re-edited and translated.
