NAUMACHIA, the Greek word denoting a naval battle, was used by the Romans as the name for mimic sea-fights which were shown as a spectacle to the public. The first that is recorded was given by Julius Caesar on an artificial lake which he constructed in the Campus Martius. After this naumachiae became a favourite spectacle for the emperors to give to the people. Claudius made a great one on the Lacus Fucinus, Nero another in the amphitheatre at Rome. Gladiators or condemned criminals fought in these battles; in later times even volunteers took part in them. The combatants were often dressed in costume: Augustus showed a naumachia of Athenians and Persians; Titus acted a sea-fight between Corinth and Corcyra.
