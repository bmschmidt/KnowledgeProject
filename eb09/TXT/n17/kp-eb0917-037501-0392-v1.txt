NEW BRUNSWICK, a city of the United States, capital of Middlesex county, New Jersey, 31 miles by rail from New York, at the head of navigation of the Raritan river, and the eastern terminus of the Raritan and Delaware Canal. The older portion occupies the low land along the river, and has narrow irregular streets; but the newer districts have spread over the higher grounds behind, and are both well built and well laid out. Conspicuous among the public buildings are Rutgers College and the theological seminary of the Reformed (Dutch) Church. The college was founded in 1770 as Queen’s College, and received its present name in honour of Colonel Henry Rutgers (1746-1830) only in 1825. It has a library of 12,000 volumes, and 16 professors and 115 students. The seminary, dating from 1784, consists of eight fine buildings—Hertzog Hall, Suydam Hall, the Gardiner Sage Library (36,000 volumes), and five professors' residences—and occupies a good position to the north of the college. India-rubber goods, hosiery, paperhangings, shoes, and machinery are manufactured on a large scale in the city. The population was 15,058 in 1870, and 17,166 in 1880. Settled in the close of the 17th century, New Brunswick was incorporated in 1736, and had become by 1748 a “pretty little town with four churches and a considerable trade with New York.” A city charter was obtained in 1784.
