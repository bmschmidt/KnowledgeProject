NICHOLS, John (1745-1826), a printer, ranks among the most industrious and voluminous of English antiquaries and collectors. He was editor of the Gentleman's Magazine for nearly half a century, from 1778 till his death, and, partly in his magazine and. partly in his numerous volumes of Anecdotes and Illustrations, made invaluable contributions to the personal history of English men of letters in the 18th century. The project of compiling these volumes grew gradually out of his business as a printer. Born in London in 1745, he had been the apprentice and successor of Bowyer, a learned and accomplished printer, a graduate of Cambridge, who had printed for many distinguished men; and on the death of this revered master, in 1778, he issued a brief memoir. This he afterwards expanded into biographical and literary anecdotes of Mr Bowyer and his friends; and, materials accumulating upon him, he expanded his design into a sort of anecdotical literary history of the century, many important letters being placed at his disposal. Large as this work is, it formed but a small part of the indefatigable collectorâ€™s activity, of which a full account is given in a memoir by Chalmers accompanying the extension of the Illustrations by Mr J. B. Nichols. One of his favourite works was an antiquarian history of the town and county of Leicester; and another, on which he himself set great value, a collection of documents illustrating the manners and expenses of ancient times in England. He produced six volumes concerning the progresses, processions, and festivities of Elizabeth and James. In the days of his apprenticeship he wrote and published two volumes of poetry, but had the good sense to throw his genial energies afterwards into other channels. Vol. xcvi. of the Gentleman's Magazine [9:17:487] contains a portrait of him at the age of eighty and several well-earned tributes to the worth of his busy and fruitful life. He died November 26, 1826.
