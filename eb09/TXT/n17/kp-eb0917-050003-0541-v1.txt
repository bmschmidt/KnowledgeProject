NIJNE-TCHIRSKAYA, a Cossack village, or stanitsa, of Russia, chief town of the Second Don district of the Don Cossack government, is situated on the right bank of the Don, at its junction with the Tchir, 25 miles below the Kalatch station of the Volga and Don Railway, and is the chief point for corn and linseed from the basin of the middle Don. Its 14,000 inhabitants (with the 11,000 of Verkne-Tchirskaya, 2 miles distant) are mostly engaged in agriculture and cattle-raising, favoured by the extensive landholdings (about 700,000 acres) belonging to the Cossacks of both stanitsas. The hills above the village are covered for several miles with rich gardens and vineyards. Besides the trade in grain and linseed, a considerable business is done in cattle, wool, and salt. Manufactures, as among the Don Cossacks generally, are very limited, being confined to tanning, brick-making, and candlemaking. The place is in regular steamboat communication with Novotcherkassk and Taganrog.
