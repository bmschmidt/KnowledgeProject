NASSAU, the capital of New Providence, and seat of government of the Bahama Islands, 25° 5 ’ 36" N. lat., 77° 2Γ 15" W. long. At one time the town was noted as a great rendezvous for pirates. Its harbour, admitting vessels drawing 12 feet, acquired much importance during the blockade of the southern ports in the American War. The population of Nassau, principally negroes and coloured people, is about 8000, out of the total island population of 11,653. Nassau extends for 3∣ miles along the north shore. It is a very pretty town, celebrated for its healthy climate, and resorted to for sea-bathing by visitors from America. It has a Government house, a plain stone cathedral, and several churches and chapels, and is a military station and a bishop’s see. Numbers of the inhabitants support themselves by looking after wrecks. Preserved fruit in tins is exported, also woods, fruit, sponges, salt, &c.
