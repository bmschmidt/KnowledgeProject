NEU-STRELITZ, the capital of the grand-duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, is charmingly situated between two small lakes, 60 miles to the north of Berlin. It is well and regularly built in the form of a star, the eight rays of which converge on a spacious market-place, adorned with a statue of Duke George (d. 1860). The ducal residence is a handsome edifice in a pseudo-Classical style, with a library of 70,000 volumes, and collections of coins and antiquities. Attached to it are a fine garden and park. The other chief buildings are the three churches, the Carolinum (a large hospital), the town-house, the barracks, the gymnasium, and the real-school. In 1880 the town contained 9407 inhabitants, chiefly Protestants. They are supported partly by ministering to the wants of the court, and partly by the manufacture of iron wares, machinery, cloth, pottery, oil, and mineral waters. Its trade, chiefly in corn, meal, and timber, is facilitated by a canal connecting the town with the Havel and the Elbe.

About 1â…œ miles to the south lies Alt-Strelitz, the old capital of the duchy, a small town with (1880) 3336 inhabitants, employed in the manufacture of tobacco, leather, wax candles, and wadding. Neu-Strelitz was not founded till 1733. In the vicinity is the chateau of Hohen-Zieritz, where Queen Louise of Prussia died in 1810.
