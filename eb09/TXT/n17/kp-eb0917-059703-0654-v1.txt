NOTO, a city of Italy, in the province of Syracuse (Sicily), 24 miles south-west of Syracuse by road on the way to Modica. Built on a new site after the earthquake of 1693, it is laid out in modern style, and contains a number of handsome mansions belonging to the provincial aristocracy. The population of the city was 15,925 in 1881; that of the commune, 16,590 in 1871, reached 18,239 in 1881.

Netum or Neetum (THtητov) was one of the cities left to Hiero of Syracuse by the treaty of 263 b.c. Like Messina and Tauromenium (Taormina) it was a foederata civitas in the time of Cicero, and at a later date it still enjoyed the rare privileges of a Latin town. Under the Saracens it was a place of importance and gave its name to one of the divisions of the island, Vai di Noto. It was one of the last of the towns of Sicily to surrender to Roger the Norman. In 1837 it was made capital of the province instead of Syracuse, but this dignity was restored to the larger city by the new Italian parliament.
