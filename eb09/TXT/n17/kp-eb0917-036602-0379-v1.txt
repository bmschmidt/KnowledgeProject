NEU-STETTIN, a manufacturing town of Prussia, in the province of Pomerania and district of KÃ¶slin, lies on the small Streitzig lake, 90 miles to the north-east of Stettin. Its industries are iron-founding, dyeing, brewing, and the manufacture of machinery and matches. The inhabitants also practise cattle-rearing and agriculture, and carry on a trade in grain, timber, and spirits. Neu-Stettin was founded in 1312, and contains (1880) 8604 inhabitants, the bulk of whom are Lutherans and Irvingites. It is the seat of a gymnasium.
