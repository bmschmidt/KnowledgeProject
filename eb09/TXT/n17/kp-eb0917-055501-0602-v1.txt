NORTH, Roger (1650-1733), in writing his Examen of Rennet’s History of England, and the “Lives” of his brothers, Lord Keeper Guilford, Sir Dudley North, and John, master of Trinity College, Cambridge, became one of the original authorities for the political and social history of the reigns of Charles II. and James II. He was a weak man, a humble worshipper of his elder brothers, and especially of the lord keeper, by whose politic energy the family of North had been raised from a very decayed condition; but the simplicity of his prejudices and the laborious minuteness of his details, notwithstanding the forensic pedantry of his style, give his writings some value. Whatever his great brother did he thought both right and noteworthy; hence he is a useful contributor to the moral history of the period.
