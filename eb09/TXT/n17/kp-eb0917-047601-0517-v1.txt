NICAeA, or Nice, still called Isnik, i.e., εlς Nικatav, was an important town of Asia Minor, in Bithynia, on the lake Ascania. Antigonus built the city on an old deserted site, and soon afterwards Lysimachus changed its name from Antigonia to Nicaea, calling it after his wife. Under the Roman empire Nicaea and Nicomedia disputed the title of metropolis of Bithynia. After Constantinople became the capital of the empire Nicaea grew in importance, and the Byzantine walls, which are still well preserved, are very extensive. On the council held there in 325 a.d. see Creeds and Council. The possession of the city was long disputed between the Greeks and the Turks. It remained an important city for some time after its final incorporation in the Ottoman empire, but has decayed till it is now a poor and insignificant village. Strabo describes the ancient Nicaea as built regularly, in the form of a square, with a gate in the middle of each side. From a monument in the centre of the city all the four gates were visible at the extremities of great cross-streets.
