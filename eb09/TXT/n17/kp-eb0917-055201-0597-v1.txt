NORMANTON, a township in the West Riding of Yorkshire, is situated on the Calder river, and on several railway lines, 3 miles (by rail) north-east of Wakefield and 24 south-south-west of York. The church of All Saints, an ancient stone structure in the Norman and Perpendicular styles, with a square tower rebuilt in 1717, contains a number of interesting monuments. The grammar school was founded about the end of the 16th century. Traces still remain of a moat surrounding the town and connected with a Roman encampment which at one time occupied its site. A mound in the neighbourhood called Haw Hill is supposed to be a barrow. There are numerous collieries in the neighbourhood. The population of the urban sanitary district (1227 acres) in 1871 was 3448, and in 1881 it was 8038. The parish of Normanton (2517 acres) includes three townships,â€”Normanton, Snydale, and Newland. Altofts (1698 acres), where Sir Martin Frobisher resided, was made into a separate parish in 1879.
