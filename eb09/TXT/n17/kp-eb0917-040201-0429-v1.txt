NEW MILLS, a township of Derbyshire, is situated at the confluence of the rivers Goyt and Kinder, on the borders of Cheshire, 8 miles south-east of Stockport and 7 south-west of Glossop. Its ancient name was Bowden Middle Cale, and formerly it included seven hamlets, but about a century ago three of these were detached, and it now includes only those of Beard, Ollersett, Thornsett, and â€™ Whittle. The name New Mills was given to it from a corn-mill erected on the Kinder in the hamlet of Ollersett, and is now specially applied to the group of factories which have grown up round it. Formerly paper and cloth were the staple industries of the district, but now the inhabitants of the various hamlets are occupied chiefly in iron and brass foundries, cotton-mills, and print-works. A public hall was erected in 1871, to which a lofty tower was added in 1875. There are almshouses and other charities. The population of the urban sanitary district (5200 acres) in 1881 was 6552.
