NORWOOD, a large suburban district of London, county of Surrey, is situated in a hilly and finely-wooded district about 1 mile south-west of Dulwich and 4 south of Lambeth. It is divided into Upper, Lower, and South Norwood, all consisting principally of villa residences and détached houses inhabited by the better classes. Almshouses for the poor of St Saviour’s, Southwark, were opened at South Norwood in 1863, a Jewish convalescent home in 1869, and the royal normal college and academy of music for the blind at Upper Norwood in 1872. There is also a Catholic convent and orphanage of the Faithful Virgin. Red pottery ware is manufactured in the neighbourhood. Norwood received its name from an old forest of oak trees. Near it is Gipsy Hill, where at one time dwelt the celebrated Margaret Finch, who died in 1740 at the age of 109, and to whom a monument has been erected in Beckenham churchyard. The population of Norwood (area 1009 acres) in 1871 was 12,536, and in 1881 it was 19,017.
