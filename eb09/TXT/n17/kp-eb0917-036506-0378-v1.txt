NEUSTADT-AN-DER-HAARDT, a small manufacturing town in the Bavarian Palatinate, is picturesquely situated at the base of the Haardt mountains and the mouth of the valley of the Speyerbach, 14 miles to the east of Spires and the Rhine. The Protestant abbeychurch, a fine Gothic edifice of 1354-1489, contains the tombs of several Counts Palatine. The other noteworthy buildings are the handsome Roman Catholic church, a modern Gothic structure; the Saalbau, a large edifice for balls and concerts; the town-house, formerly a Jesuit college; the old Latin school; the real-school; and the hospital. The chief industries are paper-making, strawplaiting, distilling, and the manufacture of cloth, gold and silver plate, furniture, starch, and hats. A brisk trade is [9:17:366] carried on in wood, grain, fruits, and wine, all of which are produced extensively in the vicinity. Neustadt, which received its municipal charter in 1275, now contains (1880) 11,411 inhabitants, of whom 6987 are Protestants and 4028 Roman Catholics. It is one of the centres of the Rhenish “grape-cure,” which attracts numerous visitors.
