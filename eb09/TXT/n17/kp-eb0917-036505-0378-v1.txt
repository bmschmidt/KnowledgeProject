NEUSTADT, or Wiener-Neustadt, an important manufacturing town in Lower Austria, is situated between the Fischa and the Leitha, close to the Hungarian frontier, and 25 miles to the south of Vienna. It was almost entirely rebuilt after a destructive fire in 1834, and ranks among the handsomest provincial towns in Austria. Its ancient gates, walls, and towers have disappeared, but it still possesses a few mediaeval edifices, the most important of which is the old castle of the dukes of Babenberg, founded in the 12th century, and converted by Maria> Theresa into a military academy (400 to 500 pupils). The Gothic chapel contains the remains of the emperor Maximilian L, who was born here in 1459. The parish church, with its two lofty towers, is substantially a Romanesque building of the 13th century, but the choir and transepts are Gothic additions of a later date. The late Gothic church of the old Cistercian abbey contains a handsome monument in memory of Eleonora of Portugal (d. 1467), consort of the emperor Frederick IV. The town-house is also a noteworthy building. The educational and charitable institutions include a gymnasium, a real-school, a normal seminary, industrial, commercial, and musical schools, and three hospitals. The chief industrial establishment is an engine-factory, employing 2500 hands, and turning out 150 to 200 locomotives annually; but manufactures of cotton, silk, velvet, pottery, and paper, sugar-refining, and tanning are also extensively carried on. Trade is also brisk, and is facilitated by a canal connecting the town with Vienna, and used chiefly for the transport of coal and timber. The population in 1880 was 23,468, nearly all Roman Catholics.

Neustadt was founded in 1192, and was a favourite residence of numerous Austrian sovereigns, acquiring the title of the “everfaithful town” {die allezeit getreue Stadt) from its unfailing loyalty. In 1246 it was the scene of a victory of the Hungarians over the Austrians; and in 1486 it was taken by Matthew Corvinus, king of Hungary, who, however, restored it to Maximilian I. four years later. In 1529 and 1683 it was besieged by the Turks. It was at Neustadt that the emperor Rudolf II. granted to the Bohemian Protestants, in 1609, the ‘ ‘ Majestätsbrief,” or patent of equal rights, the revocation of which helped to precipitate the Thirty Years’ War. Compare Böheim, Chronik von Wiener-Neustadt.
