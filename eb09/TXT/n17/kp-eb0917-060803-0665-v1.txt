NOVO-BAYAZET, or Novuιι Bayazet, a town of trans-Caucasian Russia, at the head of a district (area 2390 square miles, population 67,800) in the Erivan government, 60 miles east-north-east of Erivan, and about 4 east of Goktchi Lake, lies 5870 feet above the sea on the rocky ravine of the Kavar-tchai. An Armenian village which had stood here from an early date was destroyed by Nadir Shah of Persia in 1736, and it was not till the Turkish war of 1828-29 that the site was again occupied by Armenian refugees from the Turkish town of Bayazet or Bayazid. The name Novuii Bayazet was adopted at the organization of the Erivan government in 1850. From 4518 in 1865 the population had increased by 1873 to 5363, still mainly Armenians. There are seventeen villages in the district, each with more than 1000 inhabitants.
