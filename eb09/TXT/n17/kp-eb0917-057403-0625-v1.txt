NORWALK, a township of the United States, in Fairfield county, Connecticut, on Long Island Sound, 43 miles north-east of New York, at the terminus of the Danbury and Norwalk Railroad. It contains the borough of Norwalk, dating from 1836, and the city of South Norwalk, incorporated in 1870, the population of township, borough, and city in 1880 being respectively 13,956, 5308, and 3726. Vessels drawing 6 feet of water ascend the Norwalk river at low tide, and there is regular steamboat communication with New York. The shallow waters of the bay at the mouth of the river form a good locality for oyster-culture, and about three hundred families in South Norwalk are engaged in this industry. Locks, knobs (of New Jersey clay), and iron bolts and screws are manufactured in the township on a very extensive scale; and there are also iron-foundries, shipyards, flour-mills, planing-mills, felt factories, hat factories, carriage-works, shoe factories, &c. Norwalk was settled about 1640 and incorporated as a town in 1653. The settlement was burned by Governor Tryonâ€™s Hessians in 1779.
