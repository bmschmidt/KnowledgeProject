NEUSATZ (Hungarian, Uj Videk∙, Servian, N^ovisad),a, royal free town of Hungary, in the province of Bâcs, and the seat of a Greek non-united bishop, lies on the left bank of the Danube, opposite Peterwardein, with which it is connected by a bridge of boats. It is about 150 miles to the south of Pesth and 50 miles above Belgrade. The town is well built, and contains ten churches (Greek, Roman Catholic, and Protestant), a synagogue, a gymnasium, and a real-school. It is a steamboat station, and carries on a brisk trade in grain and fruit with Germany and Turkey. Nearly one half of its 21,325 inhabitants (1880) are Serbs, the other half being made up of Magyars, Germans, and Jews; and it has recently become a sort of religious and literary centre for the Serbs of Hungary. Neusatz was founded in the middle of the 18th century, and was almost totally destroyed in 1849, when the insurgents made an ineffectual resistance here to the imperial troops under Jellachich. In the vicinity are the remains of an extensive Roman entrenchment.
