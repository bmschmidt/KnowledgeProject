NEHEMIAH (<W∏}), governor of Judaea under Artaxerxes Longimanus; see Israel, vol. xiii. p. 418. The book of Nehemiah is really part of the same work with the book of Ezra (q.v.), though it embodies certain memoirs of Nehemiah in which he writes in the first person. Apart from what is related in this book, we possess no trustworthy information about Nehemiah. Even the legend in 2 Mac. ii. 13 that he founded a library containing ancient documents, which is often taken as authentic and as marking an important step in the history of the Old Testament canon (see vol. v. p. 2), is discredited by standing in an epistle of which the manifest aim was to give currency to certain spurious books.
