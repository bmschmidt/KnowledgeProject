NORDERNEY (i.e., northern island), the most important of the fringe of sand-islands along the coast of East Friesland, belongs to the Prussian province of Hanover. It is 8 miles long and about 1 mile broad, and supports a seafaring and fishing population of (1880) 2114 souls, of genuine old Frisian stock. The village at the south-west end of the island is one of the most popular sea-bathing places in Germany, and is visited annually by 9000 visitors, for whose accommodation numerous hotels and lodging-houses have been built. On the south side rises a lighthouse 175 feet high. At low tide Norderney may be reached from the mainland by driving or walking.
