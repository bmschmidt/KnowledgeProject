NEU-TITSCHEIN (Czech, Novy Jicin), a small but thriving town of Moravia, is picturesquely situated on an outlying spur of the Carpathians, on the Titsch, an affluent of the Oder, about 70 miles to the north-east of Brünn. It is the chief place in the Kuhländchen, a fertile valley peopled by German settlers, who rear cattle and cultivate flax. At Neu-Titschein manufactures of woollen cloth, flannel, hats, carriages, and tobacco are carried on; and it is also the centre of a brisk trade. The town was founded in 1311. It contains (1880) 10,274 inhabitants, almost entirely of German descent.
