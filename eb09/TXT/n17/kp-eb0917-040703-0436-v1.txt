NEWRY, a seaport, market-town, and parliamentary borough, partly in Armagh but chiefly in Down, province of Ulster, Ireland, is situated on the Newry navigation at the head of Carlingford Lough, and on two railway lines, 18 miles south-east of Armagh and 63 north of Dublin. The western part, called Ballybot, is connected with the eastern part or old town in Down, situated on the acclivity of a hill, by four stone bridges and a swivel bridge. The more modern streets are wide and well-paved, and there are many handsome houses and shops. The principal buildings are the infantry barracks, the town-hall, the markethouse, the court-house, and the assembly rooms. Newry is one of the most important ports of Ulster, and in connexion with several sub-ports farther down the river is the outlet for the trade of a very extensive district. In 1882 the number of vessels that entered the port was 676 of 80,586 tons burden, the number that cleared 654 of 65,262 tons. The principal exports are grain, provisions, eggs, cattle, linen cloth, and flax, and the imports include timber, manufactures, groceries, and provisions. In the neighbourhood granite of a fine quality is quarried, and the town possesses rope and sail works, breweries, distilleries, flourmills, and tanneries. The population of Newry in 1861 was 13,108, which had increased in 1871 to 14,158, and in 1881 to 15,085.

Newry is very ancient. In 1175 an abbey was founded there by Maurice Μ‘Loughlin, king of Ireland, which possessed extensive endowments and privileges. The abbey was converted in 1543 into a collegiate church for secular priests, and was dissolved by Edward VI., who grantedit to Sir Nicholas Bagnal, marshal of Ireland. He made it his private residence, and by his enterprise and energy laid the foundations of the prosperity of the town. In 1689 Newry was set on fire by the duke of Berwick when in retreat before Schomberg. Charters were granted to the town by James I. and James II. By the charter of James I. it received the privilege of sending two members to parliament, but at the Union it was restricted to one member.
