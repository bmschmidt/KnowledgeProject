NANA SAHIB is the common designation of Dandhu Panth, adopted son of the ex-peshwa of the Mahrattas, Bâji Râo, who took a leading part in the great Indian mutiny, and was proclaimed peshwa by the mutineers. See India, vol. xii. p. 810. Nana Sahib was responsible for the massacres at Cawnpore, and was engaged in the protracted campaigns in Oudh. In the closing days of 1859, when the last remnants of the rebels disappeared over the Nepalese frontier, the Nana was among the fugitives. His death was reported some time afterwards, but his real fate remains obscure. Compare Nepal.
