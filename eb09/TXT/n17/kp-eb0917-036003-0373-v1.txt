NETTLE is the vernacular equivalent of the Latin Urtica, which again gives its name to the Urticaceae. The species of Urtica are herbs covered with stinging hairs, and with unisexual flowers on the same or on different plants. The male flowers consist of a perianth of four greenish segments enclosing as many stamens, which latter, when freed from the restraint exercised upon them by the perianthsegments while still in the bud, suddenly uncoil themselves, and in so doing liberate the pollen. The female perianth is similar, but encloses only a single seed-vessel with a solitary seed. The stinging hairs consist, at the base, of a bulbous reservoir filled with acrid fluid, and prolonged into a long slender tube, the extremity of which is finely pointed. By means of this point the hair penetrates the skin and discharges its irritant contents beneath the surface. Some tropical species of Urtica produce a fluid of such potency that the most serious consequences ensue from coming into contact with the plant. Nettle tops, or the very young shoots of the nettle, Ï€iay be used as a vegetable like spinach; but from the abundance of crystals (cystolithes) they contain they are apt to be gritty, though esteemed for their antiscorbutic properties. The fibre furnished by the stems of several species is, however, of more economic importance, being used for the purpose of cordage or paper-making. Three species of nettle are wild in the British Isles, although from their general presence in the neighbourhood of houses, or in spots where house refuse is deposited, it has been suggested that they are not really natives, a supposition that to some extent receives countenance from the circumstance that the young shoots are very sensitive to frost. In any case they follow man in his migrations, and by their presence usually indicate a soil rich in nitrogen. The trailing subterranean root-stock renders the common nettle somewhat difficult of extirpation.
