NON JURORS in English history are the small minority of the beneficed clergy who incurred the penalties of suspension and deprivation for refusing to swear allegiance to William and Mary in 1689. The party, which was headed by Archbishop Sancroft and Bishop Ken, with five other members of the episcopal bench, included such men as Jeremy Collier, George Hickes, William Sherlock, Charles Leslie, and Henry Dodwell. See England, vol. viii. p. 378.
