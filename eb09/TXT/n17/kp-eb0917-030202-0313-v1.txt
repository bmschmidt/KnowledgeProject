NAXOS, the earliest Greek colony in Sicily, was founded from Chalcis in 735 b.c., on the east coast immediately south of the modern town of Taormina. Within a few years it became strong enough to found Leontini and Catana. It is impossible here to enter on the tangled history of its relations with the other Greek cities of Sicily, and with the tyrants Hippocrates, Gelo, &c. Naxos was the warmest ally of Athens in the Sicilian expedition. In 403 B.c. it'was completely destroyed by Dionysius, and was never rebuilt. Its place was supplied in 358 by Tauromenium, to which the Naxian exiles flocked.
