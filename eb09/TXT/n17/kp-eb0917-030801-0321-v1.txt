NEBUCHADNEZZAR is the familiar form, transcribed from the Hebrew of the name of the great BabyIonian[9:17:309] king who carried the Jews captive, and whose reign marks the highest point of the Chaldaean empire. Another Biblical form of the word is Nebuchadrezzar (Jer. xlix. 28), and similarly Greek authors write Ναβουκοδρόσοροζ. These forms are nearer to the original name as it is found on the cuneiform monuments, viz., Nabu-kudurri-usur, “Nebo, defend the crown.” To what has been said of Nebuchadnezzar in the article Babylonia (vol. iii. p. 188; comp. Daniel and Israel) it may be added that a fragment of a cylinder with an inscription relating to a war with Egypt in the thirty-seventh year of his reign has been published by Schrader (Aegypt. Ztschr., 1879; K.A.T., 2d ed., p. 363 sq.}, that an inscription of Nebuchadnezzar has been observed by Say ce on the north bank of Nahr al-Kalb near Beyrιit (Proc. Soc. Bib. Arch., 1881), and that two large inscriptions have also been found by Pognon in Wâdi Brissa, near Hermel, in the Lebanon (see Cl. Ganneau in The Times, December 29, 1883).
