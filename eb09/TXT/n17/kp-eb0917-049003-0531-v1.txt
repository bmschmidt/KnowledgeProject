NICOMEDES II., fourth in descent from the preceding, was son of Prusias II. He was so popular with the people that his father became jealous and sent him to Rome. Here he was so much favoured by the senate that Prusias sent an ambassador, Menas, to Rome, giving him secret orders to assassinate Nicomedes. Menas revealed the plot, and persuaded the prince to rebel against his father. Supported by Attalus II., king of Pergamum, he was completely successful, and ordered his father to be slain before the altar of Zeus in Nicomedia. Nicomedes reigned from 149 to 91 B.c., and during his long reign adhered steadily to the Roman alliance. He made himself for a time master of Paphlagonia, and married Laodice, widow of Ariarathes VI., in order to have a claim on her deceased husbandâ€™s kingdom of Cappadocia.
