NIGER, C. Pescennius, governor of Syria under the emperor Commodus, and one of the rivals of Septimius Severus for the succession after the murder of Pertinax, belonged to an Aquinum family of equestrian rank, and owed his promotion to the Syrian command not only to the interest of Narcissus, the favourite of Commodus, but also to his known merits as a soldier. He was saluted emperor by the troops at Antioch as soon as the death of Pertinax became known, in the spring of 193 A.D., but he unaccountably delayed marching on Rome until he learned that Severus had assumed the offensive. He now strongly garrisoned Byzantium as well as the principal towns of Asia Minor, but after his legate Aemilianus had been defeated and slain near Cyzicus he himself was driven from Nicaea and decisively routed, with great slaughter, in the neighbourhood of the Cilician Gates. Having failed in an effort to escape towards the Euphrates, he was brought back and put to death in 194.
