NEWARK, a city of the United States, capital of Licking county, Ohio, is situated on the Licking river and on the Ohio and Erie Canal, and is 33 miles from Columbus by the railway to Pittsburg. It is a flourishing agricultural and industrial centre, with extensive railway shops, foundries, and manufactories of glass, paper, steam-engines, and agricultural implements: and sandstone quarries and coal-mines are worked in the neighbourhood. Some of the most extensive and interesting of the earth-work remains of the prehistoric inhabitants of North America are found here. The population was 3654 in 1850, 6698 in 1870, and 9602 in 1880.
