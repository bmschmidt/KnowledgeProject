NOCERA INFERIORE, formerly Nocera dei Pagani, a city of Italy in the province of Salerno at the foot of Monte Albino, 22âˆ£ miles east-south-east of Naples on the railway to Salerno, which lies only 10 or 11 miles distant. In 1881 it had a communal population of 15,858, that of the town was 12,830; but the interest of the place is almost exclusively historical.

Nuceria Alfa terna, first mentioned as assisting the Samnites in 315 B.c., was a few years later (308) besieged and captured by Fabius. In 216 Hannibal completely destroyed the city and dispersed its inhabitants; but the town, having been repeopled at some unknown date, appears again as a flourishing municipium in the time of Cicero. In 73 b.c. it was plundered by Spartacus, and under Augustus it received a Roman colony (Nuceria Constantia), afterwards recruited by Nero. At an early date the city became an episcopal see, and in the 12th century it sided with Innocent 11, against Roger of Sicily, and suffered severely for its choice. A colony of Saracens introduced by Frederick II. probably gave rise to the epithet by which it was so long distinguished, as well as to the town of Pagani, which lies about a mile to the west. In 1385 Pope Urban VI. was besieged in the castle by Charles of Durazzo. Nocera was the birthplace of Solimena the painter; and in the list of its bishops appears the name of Paulus Jovius.

Nocera Inferiore must not be confounded with Nocera Umbria (the ancient Nuceria Camellaria), an old episcopal city 14 miles from Foligno.
