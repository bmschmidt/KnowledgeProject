FABRICIUS, Caius Luscinus, a Roman general and consul, was perhaps the first member of the Fabricia gens who settled in Rome. He makes his earliest appearance in history as one of the ambassadors sent to the Tarentines to dissuade them from making war on the Romans. Elected consul in 282 B.c., he in the same year defeated the Boii and the Etruscans. When in the following year the Romans were defeated by Pyrrhus, Fabricius was sent to treat for the ransom and exchange of the prisoners, and Pyrrhus endeavoured unsuccessfully to bribe him with large offers to enter his service. In 278 Fabricius was elected consul for the second time, and was successful in negotiating terms of peace with Pyrrhus, who sailed away to Italy. Fabricius afterwards gained a series of victories over the Samnites, the Lucanians, and the Bruttii, and on his return to Rome received the honour of a triumph. Notwithstanding the offices he had filled he died poor, and provision had to be made for his daughter out of the funds of the state. In honour of his military achievements and his incorruptible integrity, the senate also decreed that he and his descendants should have a burial place inside the city.
