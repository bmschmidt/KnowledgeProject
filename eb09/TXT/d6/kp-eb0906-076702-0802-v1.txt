DAIMIEL, a town of Spain, at the head of a department of the province of Ciudad Real, and about 20 miles north-east of the town of that name, with which it is connected by rail. It is situated in a fertile plain on the Azuer, and is regarded as one of the most flourishing places in the La Mancha district. Linens and woollens are manufactured, and a purgative salt known as Sal de Inghilterra is extracted from the neighbouring marshes. Being of comparatively modern foundation, the town presents nothing very remarkable in its architecture. Population about 12,000.
