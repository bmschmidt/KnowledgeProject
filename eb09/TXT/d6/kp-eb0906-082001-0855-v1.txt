DANVERS, a town of the United States, in the county of Essex, in Massachusetts, about two miles from Salem and fifteen miles N.N.E. of Boston, with which it is connected by rail. The principal industry is the manufacture of boots and shoes, which employs a large proportion of the inhabitants, and annually puts into the market upwards of a million pairs; there are also brickyards, tanneries, and a carpet factory. The most interesting building is the Peabody Institute, with its library and art-collections, founded in 1852 by George Peabody, the philanthropist, who was born at Danvers in 1795. Population in 1870, 5600.
