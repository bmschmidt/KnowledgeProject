DARABJIRD, or Darab-ghera, a city of Persia in the province of Farsistan, 140 miles south-east of Shiraz. It is situated in a very fertile district at the foot of mountains, and is embellished by luxuriant orchards of orange, lemon, and date trees. Though greatly fallen from its former prosperity, it is still one of the most important cities of the province. Its name signifies the city or residence of Darius, and by Von Hammer it was identified with the ancient Pasargadae. In the neighbourhood there are various remains of antiquity, the most important of which, 3j miles to the south, is known as the Khaleh-Darfib, or citadel of Darius, and consists of a series of earthworks arranged in a circle round an isolated rock. Nothing remains, however, to fix the date or explain the history of the fortification. Another monument of the vicinity is « gigantic bas-relief carved on the vertical face of a rock, apparently representing the victory of Sapor I. of Persia over the Emperor Valerian. A full description of both monuments will be found in the second volume of Flandin’s Voyage en Perse.
