DAN, a town of ancient Judea, near the head-waters of the Jordan, inhabited at the time of the Israelitish conquest by a peaceful and commercial population whose name for their city was Laish, or Leshem. It appears to have been even at this early period a sacred city, and hence it was naturally chosen long after by Jeroboam as the seat of one of his golden calves. The Jewish name, which it derived from the tribe to whose lot it fell, became proverbial in the expression “from Dan to Beersheba.” The town was plundered by Benhadad of Damascus, and appears from that time to have gradually declined. Its site is probably marked by the mound called Tell-el-Kady, “the hill of the judge,” or “the hill of Dan.”
