DANIEL, Gabriel (1649-1728), a French Jesuit historian, was born at Rouen in 1649. He was educated by the Jesuits, entered the order at the age of eighteen, and became superior at Paris. He is best known by his Histoire de France depuis l'établissement de la Monarchie Franchise, which appeared first in 1713, and has since been published in 1758 and in 1755-60, the last edition with notes by P. Griffet. Daniel published an abridgment in 1728; and another abridgment was published by Dorival in 1751. Though full of prejudices, which affect his accuracy, Daniel had the advantage of consulting valuable original sources, and his book has been praised by such authorities as Henri Martin and Thierry. Daniel also wrote a by no means successful reply to Pascal’s Provincial Letters, entitled Entretiens de Cléanthe et d'Eudoxe sur les Lettres Provinciates; a Histoire de la Milice fran ç aise depuis l'établissement de la monarchic fran ç aise jusqu' à la fin de la r è gne de Louis le Grand (1721); two treatises on the Cartesian theory as to the intelligence of the lower animals, and other works.
