HODMEZÖ-VÄSÄRHELY, a corporate town in the county of Csongràd, Hungary, is situated on the lake Hôd, and on the Alföld Railway, about 90 miles S.E. of Budapest, 46° 27' N. lat., 20° 22' E. long. The town is large and rapidly improving, and has many public buildings. Of these the most noteworthy are the townhall, the Roman Catholic, Greek, and Protestant (one Lutheran and two Calvinist) churches, the Jews’ synagogue, the Protestant gymnasium, and the royal law courts. Hôdmezo-Vâsârhely possesses also many elegant private residences, two hospitals, two banks, and several literary institutions, and has a flourishing trade. The soil of the surrounding country is exceedingly fertile, the chief products being wheat, mangcorn, barley, oats, millet, maize, and various descriptions of fruit, especially melons. Extensive vineyards, yielding large quantities of both white and red grapes, skirt the town, which has also a fine public garden. The horned cattle and horses of Hödmezö-Vâsârhely are considered the best in the Alföld; sheep and pigs are also extensively reared. The commune is protected from inundations of the Theiss by an enormous dike, but the town, nevertheless, sometimes suffers considerable damage during the spring floods. In 1870 the population was 49,153, chiefly Magyars.
