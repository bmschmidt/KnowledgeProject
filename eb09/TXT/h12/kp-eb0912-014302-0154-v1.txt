HONORIUS, Flavius Augustus, was emperor of the West from 397 to 425 a.d. His reign of twenty-eight years was one of the most eventful in the Roman annals; the weakness and timidity of the emperor co-operated with the attacks of the Goths and Vandals in promoting the rapid disintegration of the empire. But his influence on the current of events was purely negative, and his reign will be noticed under Roman History.
