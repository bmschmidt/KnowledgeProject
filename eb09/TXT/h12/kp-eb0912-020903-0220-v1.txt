HORTEN (Karljohanswaern), a seaport town of Norway, in the amt of Jarlsberg-Laurvig, is beautifully situated on the west bank of the Christiania fjord, opposite Moss, and 32 miles south of Christiania. It is defended by strong fortifications, is the headquarters of the Norwegian fleet, and possesses an arsenal and shipbuilding yards, as well as a real school, a national school of the higher grade, an observatory, a nautical museum, and an infirmary. It also carries on a considerable shipping trade. The population, which in 1836 did not exceed 200, was 5457 in 1875.
