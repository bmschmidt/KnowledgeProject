HUMILIATI, a religious order founded at Milan early in the 12th century by certain noblemen of Lombardy, who, having been carried captive into Germany, had regained their freedom by their “humility,” did not, according to Helyot in his Ordres Monastiques, take the monastic vows till 1134, when they were induced to do so by St Bernard. In 1164 their ranks were recruited by other Milanese noblemen who had been similarly carried into Germany by Frederick Barbarossa. About 1151 the order was brought under the rule of St Benedict, and in 1200 it was approved by Innocent III. Confirmed and privileged by succeeding popes, the Humiliati began to be corrupted by their popularity and prosperity, until, after a futile attempt to reform the order, Pius V. finally suppressed it in 1571, At that date they had ninety-four houses under their jurisdiction. The wives of the original founders instituted a female order of Humiliatce, also called, from a prominent early member, the Nuns of Blassoni, which, exempted from Pius’s bull of suppression, still has representatives in Italy.
