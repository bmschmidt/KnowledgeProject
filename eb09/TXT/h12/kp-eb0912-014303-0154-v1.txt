HONORIUS I., pope from 625 to 638, succeeded Boniface V. The festival of the Elevation of the Cross is said to have been instituted during his pontificate, which was marked also by considerable missionary enterprise. Honorius in his lifetime had favoured the formula proposed by the emperor Heraclius with the design of bringing about a reconciliation between the Monophysites and the Catholics, which bore that Christ had accomplished His work of redemption by one manifestation of His will as the God-man. For this he was, more than forty years after his death, anathematized by name along with the other Monothelite heretics by the council of Constantinople (First Trullan) in 680; and this condemnation was subsequently confirmed by more than one pope, particularly by Leo TI., as has been abundantly proved by unimpeachable evidence against the contentions of Baronius and Bellarmine (see Hefele, Die Irrlehre des Honorius u. das vati-cÎ±nische Lehre der Unfehlbarkeit, 1871, who, however, has modified his view in Conciliengeschichte, 1877). Honorius I. was succeeded by Severinus.
