HOLZMINDEN, the chief town of a circle in the duchy of Brunswick, Germany, is situated on the right bank of the Weser, at the foot of the Sollinger mountains, and on the railway from Kreiensen to Altenbeken, 56 miles southwest of Brunswick. It is the seat of a circle administration, of a circle and common court, and of a general superintendent. The educational establishments include a gymnasium and an architectural school, the latter attended by upwards of 1000 scholars. The prosperity of the town [9:12:107] depends chiefly on agriculture and the manufacture of iron and steel-wa , es, but weaving and the making of pottery are also carried on, and there are baryta mills and polishing-mills for sandstone. By means of the Weser it carries on a lively trade. Holzminden obtained town rights from Count Otto of Eberstein in 1245. In 1410 it came into the possession of Brunswick. The population in 1875 was 6887.
