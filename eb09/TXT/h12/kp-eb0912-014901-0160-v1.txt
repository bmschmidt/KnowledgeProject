HOOK, Walter Farquhar (1798-1875), son of the Rev. Dr James Hook, dean of Worcester, and nephew of the witty Theodore, was born in London, 13th March 1798. Educated at Tiverton and Winchester, he graduated at Oxford (Christ Church) in 1821, and after holding an incumbency in Coventry, 1829-37, and in Leeds, 1837-59, was nominated dean of Chichester by Lord Derby. He had received the degree of D.D. in 1837. His friendship towards the Traςtarians exposed him to considerable persecution, but his simple manly character and zealous devotion to parochial work gained him the support of widely divergent classes. Throughout life he held steadily by sober high-church principles, and the earnest, elevated tone of his mind is exemplified in such sermons as “Hear the Church !” which was preached before the court in 1837, and subsequently passed through many large editions. The vigorous practical turn of his Christianity is attested by the erection in the parish of Leeds, during his incumbency, of 21 new churches, 32 parsonages, and over 60 schools, in addition to the rebuilding of the parish church at a cost of £28,000. His literary works, which are numerous, attain the limit of their design in advancing some incidental plea or in contributing to the student’s resources.. The principal are An Ecclesiastical Biography, containing the Lives of Ancient Fathers and Modern Divines (8 vols., 1845-52), A Church Dictionary (Sth ed., 1859), The Means of Rendering more Effectual the Education of the People (10th ed., 1851), The Cross of Christ (1873), The Church and its Ordinances (sermons, 4 vols., 1876), and Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury (12 vols., 1860-76). He died 20th October 1875. A memorial church has been •erected in his honour at Leeds; it is a 13th century Gothic structure, designed by Sir G. G. Scott (cost £25,000), and was consecrated 29th January 1880.
