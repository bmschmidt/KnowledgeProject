HODGKINSON, Eaton (1789-1861), a distinguished engineer, was the sou of a farmer, and was born at Anderton near Northwich, Cheshire, 26th February 1789. He received his first stimulus to the study of mathematics at the grammar school of Northwich, and this interest was further quickened by the instructions of Dr Dalton at Manchester, whither he had removed in 1811, and where, instead of following his original purpose to study for the church, he was assisting his widowed mother to establish a business. For several years he carried on mechanical researches and experiments, but his first discovery of importance was that of a new form of iron girder, by which a gain of two-fifths in strength was obtained over that formerly in use. After this he carried on investigations of a similar character in conjunction with Sir William Fairbairn, who greatly profited by his suggestions and assistance in some of his more important inventions. In 1840 Hodgkinson communicated a paper to the Royal Society on Experimental Researches on the Strength of Pillars of Cast-iron and other Haterials in recognition of which he in 1841 received the royal medal, and was also elected a fellow. His formulae for solid and hollow pillars soon obtained general adoption in all engineering class-books. Subsequently he was employed by Stephenson to verify the experiments of Fairbairn on wrought-iron tubes, with a view to the construction of the Britannia Bridge; and for his co-operation in this work he received a silver medal at the Paris Exhibition of 1855. In 1847 he was appointed professor of the mechanical principles of engineering in University College, London. In 1848 he was chosen president of the Manchester Philosophical Society, of which he had been a member since 1826, and to which, both previously and subsequently, he contributed many of the more important results of his discoveries. For several years he took an active part in the discussions of the Institution of Civil Engineers, of which he was elected an honorary member in 1851. He died at Eaglesfield House, near Manchester, 18th June 1861. The name of Hodgkinson will always be associated with those of Fairbairn and Stephenson, and without his assistance it may safely be affirmed that the most brilliant achievements of both would have been impossible.
