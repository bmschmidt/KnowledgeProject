HORMISDAS, pope from 514-523, in succession to Symmachus, was a native of Campania. Although on his election overtures were at once made by Anastasius I., emperor of the East, for the reunion of the Eastern and Western Churches, which had been separated since the excomunication of Acacius in 484, the zeal or intolerance of the pope delayed it till he was able to procure it on his own terms, in 519, from the orthodox emperor Justin. Horraisdas paid much attention to the instruction of his clergy in psalmody. He was succeeded in 523 by John I. Eighty of his letters are preserved in Labbe’s Sacrosancta Concilia, vol. V. (1728), and are also to be found in vol. lxiii. of Migne’s Patrologioe Cursus Completus (Latin series).
