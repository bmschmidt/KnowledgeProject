HUANUCO, or Guanuco, the chief town of the Peruvian department of the same name, is situated on the left bank of the river Huallaga near its junction with the Higueras, in a beautiful valley nearly 6000 feet above sealevel, and 180 miles north-west of Lima. The streets are laid out regularly, but the houses are mean-looking. As nearly every house is surrounded by a garden the limits of the town embrace a large area. Sweetmeats for the Lima market are almost the only manufacture, most of the inhabitants being engaged in mining and farming. Huanuco was founded in 1539 by Gomez Alvarado, and was shortly afterwards raised to a bishopric. In 1812 during an insurrection of the Indians of Panao it was plundered. The population in 1876 was 5263.
