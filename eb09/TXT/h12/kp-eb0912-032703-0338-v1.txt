HUARAZ, chief town of the Peruvian department of Ancachs, and of a district to which it gives its name, is situated on the left bank of the river Santa, in a fertile valley of the Andes, about 190 miles N.N.W. of Lima. There is some export trade in cattle, wheat, sugar, and fruit; and in the vicinity considerable quantities of gold, silver, and copper are mined. A state railway 172 miles long, of which 82 miles are completed, is designed to connect Huaraz with Chimbote on the coast. Near the town there are ruins in the second or Cyclopean style of Inca architecture, sufficiently like the remains at Tiahuanca to allow us to assign Huaraz as the northern limit of the prehistoric Incarial empire, of which Tiahuanca was the southern boundary. Population in 1876, 4851.
