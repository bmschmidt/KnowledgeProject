HUNT, William Henry (1790-1864), water-colour painter, was born near Long Acre, London, March 28, 1790. Overcoming the usual parental objections, he was apprenticed about 1805 to John Varley, the landscape-painter, with whom he remained five or six years, exhibiting three oil pictures at the Royal Academy in 1807. He was early connected with the society of painters in water-colour, of which body, then in a transition state, he was elected associate in 1824, and full member in 1827. To its exhibitions he was until the year of his death one of the most prolific contributors. Many years of Hunt’s uneventful and industrious life were passed at Hastings. He died of apoplexy, February 10, 1864.

Hunt was one of the creators of the English school of water-colour painting. His subjects, especially those of his later life, are extremely simple; but, by the delicacy, humour, and fine power.of their treatment, they take rank second to works of the highest art only. Considered technically, his works exhibit all the resources of the water-colour painter’s craft, from the purest transparent tinting to the boldest use of body-colour, rough paper, and scraping for texture. His sense of colour is perhaps as true as that of any English artist. “He was,” says Ruskin, “take him for all in all, the finest painter of still life that ever existed.” Several fine and characteristic examples of Hunt’s work, as the Boy and Goat, Brown Study, and Plums, Primroses, and Birds’ Nests, are in the water-colour galleries at South Kensington.
