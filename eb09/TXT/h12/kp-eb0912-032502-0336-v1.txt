HOXTER (Latin, Huxaria), a town of Prussia, capital of a circle in the government district of Minden, province of Westphalia, is situated on the Weser at its confluence with the Grube and the Schelpe, and on a branch line of the Westphalian Railway, 2∣ miles S.W. of Holzminden. It is the seat of a provincial office and of a circle court, and possesses an Evangelical and a Catholic church, a synagogue, a gymnasium, a building-school, and a hospital. The Weser is crossed by a stone bridge about 500 feet in length, erected in 1833. On the Brunsberg adjoining the town there is an old watch-tower said to be the remains of a fortress built by Bruno, brother of Wittekind. Near Höxter is the castle, formerly the Benedictine monastery, of Corvey (see Corvey). The principal manufactures of the town are linen, cotton, cement, and gum, and there is also a considerable shipping trade. The papulation in 1875 was 5645.

Höxter in the time of Charlemagne was a villa regia, and was the scene of a battle between him and (he Saxons. Under the protection of the monastery of Corvey, founded in 816, it gradually increased in prosperity. Ultimately it asserted its independence and joined the Hansa League. It suffered severely during the [9:12:326] Thirty Years’ War, being captured four several times. After the peace of Westphalia it was united to Brunswick; in 1802 it was transferred to Orange-Nassau, and in 1807 to Westphalia, after the dismemberment of which in 1814 it came into the possession of Prussia.
