HORGEN, a village in the Swiss canton of Zurich, capital of the district of Horgen, is situated on the left bank of the Zurich Lake, 1500 feet above sea-level, and 9 miles south of Zurich. It is surrounded by meadows and vineyards, and possesses many handsome houses, and a beautiful church with frescos by Barzaghi. The town is one of the centres of the Zurich silk industry and vine culture, and the meeting-place of the boats which ply on the north [9:12:167] and south banks of the lake. The population in 1870 was 5199, of whom 4744 were Protestants.
