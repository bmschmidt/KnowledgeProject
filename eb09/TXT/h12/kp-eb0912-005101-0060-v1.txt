HOHENELBE (Bohemian, Vrchlabi âˆ– the chief town of a government district in Bohemia, is beautifully situated on both banks of the Elbe, crossed there by five bridges, on the southern spurs of the Riesengebirge, and on the north-west Austrian railway, 16 miles north-east of Gitschin. The houses with lofty gables and arcades supported by wooden columns have a picturesque appearance; and among the principal buildings are the decanal church, the castle surrounded by a fine park, the Augustine monastery, the citizen school, and the trade school. Linen and cotton are the staple manufactures, and there are also bleachworks, dye-works, and a paper-mill. A splendid view is obtained from the Heidelberg, which rises to the height of 3120 feet immediately behind the town. The population in 1869 was 5316.
