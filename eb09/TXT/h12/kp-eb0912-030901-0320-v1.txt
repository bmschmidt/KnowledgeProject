HOT SPRINGS, a post village in Hot Springs county, Arkansas, United States, is situated on a tributary of the Washita river, 55 miles S.W. of Little Rock. It is much resorted to by strangers on account of its hot springs, which are about sixty in number, and together have a daily flow of about 500,000 gallons. They vary in temperature from 93° to 150° Fahr., and their beneficial effects depend chiefly upon external application. The principal diseases in which they are efficacious are affections of the skin, malarial fever, and rheumatism. The number of persons who make use of them is about 20,000 annually. The town is well supplied with hotels and churches. The population, which in 1870 was 1276, was 5179 in 1880.
