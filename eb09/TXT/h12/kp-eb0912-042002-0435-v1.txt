HYADES, five stars forming the head of the larger constellation, the Bull. Their rising along with the sun marks the opening of the rainy season, hence their name Hyades —the Rainy. As mythological figures they were said to be daughters of Atlas, who as à reward for some pious act were translated to heaven. The nature of the deed is variously stated.: sometimes it is their long-continued grief for their brother Hyas, who was slain by a snake (or boar or lion); at other times it is their having acted as nurses of Dionysus Hyes. In the latter case they are counted as nymphs of Nysa. When their charge was threatened by Lycurgus they fled with him to Thetis or to Ino in Thebes. They are also described as nymphs of Dodona, who acted as nurses of the infant Zeus. In any case their character as clouds and rain-givers is obvious. Their number is sometimes given as two, also as three, especially in Attica, which leads Brunn to see them in the pediment of the Parthenon in the figures usually spoken of as “The Fates.”
