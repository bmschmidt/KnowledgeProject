HOR, Mount ("'ζ ’ p "*∏, Ωp τo opoç), a lofty and conspicuous double-topped mountain in Arabia Petraea, forming part of the great Jurassic chain of Shera or Seir. It stands on the eastern edge of the great valley of the Arabah, which extends from the head of the Gulf of Akabah to the valley of the Jordan, and it is referred to in Scripture as “on the border” or “at the edge” of the land of Edom (Numb. XX. 23, xκxiii. 37). According to the most recent measurements, its height is 4800 feet above the level of the sea. Mount Hor was the first halting-place of the Israelites after they had turned from Kadesh on their way southwards towards Zalmonah and the Red Sea, in order to encompass the land of Edom; and it was while the host was encamped at Kadesh that Aaron ascended this mountain to die. This last event is commemorated in the modern name of the mountain, Djebel Nebi Harûn, “the hill of the prophet Aaron,” whose “tomb,” a small square Saracenic structure, now occupies one of the summits. Another Mount Hor (to δρο<s to δpος, LXX.) is mentioned in Scripture in the passage which (Numb, xxxiv. 7, 8) defines the northern boundary of the prospective conquests of the Israelites. It is probably to be identified with Lebanon.
