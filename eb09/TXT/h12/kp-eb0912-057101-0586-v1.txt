HYMEN, or Hymenaeus, was originally the name of the song sung at marriages among the Greeks. As usual the name gradually produced the idea of an actual person whose adventures gave rise to the custom of this song. He occurs often in association with Linus and Ialemus, who represent similar personifications, and is generally called a son of Apollo and a Muse. In Attic legend he was a beautiful youth who, being in love with a girl, followed her in a procession to Eleusis disguised as a woman, and saved the whole band from pirates. As reward he obtained the girl in marriage, and his happy married life caused him ever afterwards to be invoked in marriage songs. At other times the tale is of an opposite character; Hymen was unfortunate either by dying on his marriage day or in some other way, and he was invoked to propitiate him and avert a similar fate. He occurs often in the train of Aphrodite, along with Eros, Himerus, Pothus, &c. According to Orphic legend he was restored to life by Asclepius.
