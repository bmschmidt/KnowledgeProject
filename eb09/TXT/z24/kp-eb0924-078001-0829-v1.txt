ZENTA, a market town of Hungary, in the county of BÃ¡cs-Bodrog, on the right bank of the river Theiss, 20 miles south of Szegedin, is historically known for the decisive victory won in its vicinity by Prince Eugene over the Turks in 1696. The population, which is purely agricultural, numbered 21,200 in 1880, and 16,000 in 1886.
