ROMFORD an old market-town of Essex, is situated on the small river Rom, and on the Great Eastern Railway about 12 miles east-north-east of London. The ancient church of St Edward the Confessor was replaced in 1850 by a structure in the Late Decorated style. The large brewery of Inde, Coope, & Co. is situated in the town, and there are extensive market gardens in the neighbourhood. A grant of a market was obtained in 1247, and this is still of importance as regards both cattle and corn. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 1159 acres) in

1871 was 6512, and in 1881 it was 7176.
