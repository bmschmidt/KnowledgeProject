RAWMARSH a large village and urban sanitary district in the West Riding of Yorkshire, is situated on the ridge of a hill above the valley of the Don and on the Midland Railway, 2 miles north of Rotherham and 12 south-west of Doncaster. It possesses extensive iron-works and steel rolling-mills, and there are collieries in the neighbourhood. The church of St Lawrence was rebuilt in 1839 with the exception of the old Norman tower. There are several almshouses and other charities. At the time of the Conquest the manor was granted to Walter dâ€™Eincourt, and in the 12th century it was divided among the three daughters of his subinfeudatory Paganus, who is supposed to have been the founder of the church. The population of the urban sanitary district (area, 2578 acres) in 1871 was 6869, and in 1881 it was 10,179.
