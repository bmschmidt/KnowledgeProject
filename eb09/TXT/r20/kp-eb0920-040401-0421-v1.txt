REPLEVIN. Since the article Distress ( q.v .) Avas written the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1883, has made some changes in the law of replevin in England. The period of five days during which the tenant or owner of goods may replevy by 2 Will, & Mary c. 5, ยง 1, is extended in the case of holdings within the Act to fifteen days, on the tenant or owner making a request in writing to that effect and giving security for additional costs. A summary remedy in the nature of replevin is given, a court of summary jurisdiction having a jurisdiction concurrent with that of the county court conferred upon it in the case of distress on a holding \\ r ithin the Act.
