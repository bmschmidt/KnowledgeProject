RED WING a city of the United States, capital of Goodhue county, Minnesota, occupies a commanding site on a plateau encircled by high bluffs (nearly 300 feet high), on the west bank of the Mississippi, 41 miles south of St Paul on the La Crosse division of the Chicago and St Paul Railroad; it is also the eastern terminus of the Cannon Valley branch of the same railway. Red Wing has an opera-house and a music-hall; it trades in lumber, manufactures earthenware, waggons and carriages, furniture, flour, leather, and boots and shoes, and exports large quantities of wheat. The population was 4260 in 1870 and 5876 in 1880; in 1885 it was estimated at 8000, including 1050 employ√©s in manufactories.
