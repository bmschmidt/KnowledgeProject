RICHTER Ernst Friedrich Eduard (1808-1879), writer on musical theory and composition, was born at Grosschönau in Saxony, on October 24, 1808. He first studied music at Zittau, and afterwards at Leipsic, where he attained so high a reputation that in 1843 he was appointed professor of harmony and counterpoint at the conservatorium of music, then newly founded by Mendelssohn. On the death of Hauptmann, January 3, 1868, he was elected cantor of the Thomasschule, which office he retained until his death, April 9, 1879. He is best known by three theoretical works — Lehrbτwh der Harmonie, Lehre vom Contrapunct, and Lehre von der Fuge— originally written for the use of his pupils at the Conservatorium, but now everywhere accepted as valuable text-books, and well known to English students through the excellent translation by Mr Franklin Taylor.
