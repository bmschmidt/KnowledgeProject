ROMANUS I. (Lecapenus), who shared the imperial throne with Constantine VII. (</.v.) and exercised all the real power from 919 to 944, was admiral of the Byzantine fleet on the Danube when, hearing of the defeat of the army at Achelous (17th August 917), he resolved to sail for Constantinople. Popular caprice as well as his influence over his sailors aided his ambition, and, after the marriage of his daughter Helena to Constantine, he was first proclaimed “basileopater” in April 919 and afterwards crowned colleague of his son-in-law on 17th December of the same year. His reign, which was undistinguished and uneventful, was terminated by his own sons Stephen and Constantine, who in 944 carried him off to the island of Prote and compelled him to become a monk. He died in 948.
