REICHENBACH a cotton-manufacturing town of Prussian Silesia, with 7225 inhabitants (1880) and an old castle, lies 30 miles to the south-south-west of Breslau, and demands mention chiefly from its connexion with several important historical events. In 1762 Frederick the Great gained a victory here over the Austrians; by the Reichen-bach convention of 1790 England and the other powers guaranteed the subsistence of the Turkish empire; and in 1813 a treaty, afterwards ratified at Prague, was concluded here between Austria and the allies.
