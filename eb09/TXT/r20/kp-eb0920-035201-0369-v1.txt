REID Sir William (1797-1858), administrator and man of science, was born in 1797 at the manse of Kin-glassie, Fifeshire, Scotland, and entered the army in 1809 as a lieutenant of royal engineers. He saw active service in the Peninsula under Wellington, and afterwards took part in the bombardment of Algiers in 1816. It was while governor of Bermuda that in 1838 he published the work by which he is now known, The Law of Storms, which obtained a wide popularity and did good service in furthering the progress of this department of meteorology. In 1851 he was chairman of the executive committee of the Great Exhibition; on the completion of the work he was made a K.C.B. and appointed governor of Malta. He died in October 1858, shortly after his return to England.
