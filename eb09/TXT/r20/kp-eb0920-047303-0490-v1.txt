RESHAL i.e., Rabbenu Shelomoh Loria (or Luria, vulgo Lurye), was one of the famous “Five ^[1.] Sages” (Rabbis) of the 16th century. His father’s name was

R. Yehiel of Ostroff (S. W. Russia), a descendant of Rashi ^[2.] ( q.v. ). He is also known under the name of Rashal, or Maharshal ( i.e. , Morenu Harab R. Shelomoh Loria). He himself was chief rabbi of Lublin, where he died in 1573. His works are of importance on account of the numerous, though only incidental, notices they contain in connexion with the history of Jewish literature. We name six of these works—one edition of each

(1) Hokhmath Shelomoh, discussions on the Babylonian Talmud, Rashi, the Tosaphoth, &c. This work is now an integral part of the Talmud editions. (2) Yamshel Shelomoh·.—(a) on Yomtob (or Besah), Lublin, 1636, and reprints; (b) on Yebamoth, Altona, 1739; (c) on Kethuboth (first four perakim), Stettin, 1862; (d) on Kiddu-shin, Berlin, 1766; (e) on Gittin, Berlin, 1761, and reprint; (f) on Bobo Kammo, Prague, 1616, and reprint; (g) on Hullin, Cracow, 1646, and reprints. All these are in folio. (3) Yeri'oth Shelomoh, supercommentary on Rashi on the Pentateuch, with special reference to Mizrahi’s supercommentary, Prague, 1608, 4to. (4) 'Atereth Shelomoh, on the Illicüa et Licita of R. Yishak of Düren, Basel. 1599, and reprint, folio. (5) 'Ammτιde Shelomoh, on the Sephcr Hammisvoth of R. Mosheh of Coucy, Basel, 1599, 4to. (6) Re-sponsa, Lublin, 1574, 4to, and reprints in folio. (S. M. S.-S.)
