RAGUSA a city of Italy in the province of Syracuse (Sicily), 16 miles east of Vittoria and 10 north-north-Avest of Modica, lies on the right side of the valley of the Ragusa or Erminio (Herminius). It consists of an upper toAvn Avith 24,183 inhabitants and a lotver toAATi with 6260 (1881), the two communes having a total population of 30,720. The church of Santa Maria della Scala is in part modern, but in part of considerable antiquity and interest ; and San Giorgio contains the tomb of Bernardo Caprera (ob. 1423), who tried to seize the crown of Sicily. Ragusa possesses a large cotton-factory. Stone impreg nated with petroleum is quarried in the Grotta Oleosa in the neighbourhood, and after the oil is burned out becomes an article of export under the name of pietra nera. The city, which Avas destroyed by earthquake in 1693, is of considerable antiquity, as is proved by the numerous ancient tombs existing in the district; but whether it is to be identified Avith Hybla Herma is matter of opinion.

The name, of unknoAvn origin, appears as Rhaugia, Rhaugium,

Rhausium, Ragusium, Lavusa, Labuda, Labussedum, &c.
