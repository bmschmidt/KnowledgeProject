RATRAMNUS a theological controversialist of some mark, who flourished in the 9th century, was a monk of the Benedictine abbey of Corbie near Amiens, but beyond this fact almost nothing of his personal history has been preserved. He is now best known by his treatise on the Eucharist {De corpore et sanguine Domini liber), in which he controverted the doctrine of transubstantiation as taught in a similar work by his contemporary Radbertus Pascliasius (see above, p. 210). In the controversy about election, when appealed to by Charles the Bald, he wrote two books De prsedestinatione Dei, in which he maintained the doctrine of a twofold predestination, nor did the fate of Gottschalk deter him from supporting the view of that unfortunate theologian against Hincmar as to the orthodoxy of the expression “trina Deltas.” Ratramnus perhaps won most glory in his own day by his Contra Graecorum opposita, in four books (868), a much valued contribution to the controversy between the Eastern and Western Churches which had been raised by the publication of the encyclical letter of Pliotius in 867.
