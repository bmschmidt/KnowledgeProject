ROGER of Wendover, who was a monk in the abbey of St Albans, and who died prior of Belvoir in 1237, was long regarded as the sole author of a Latin chronicle entitled Flores Historiarum, being a history of the world from the creation down to the year 1235. Recent investigation, however, has disclosed that only the portion from 1189 onwards is from his pen, and that the remainder must be attributed to John de Cella, who was abbot of St Albans from 1195 to 1214. See vol. xv. p. 634.
