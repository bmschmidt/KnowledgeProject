RIPLEY a well-built market town of Derbyshire, situated near the river Derwent and the Cromford Canal, and on a branch line of the Midland Railway 10 miles north of Derby and 10 south of Chesterfield. The principal public building is the market-hall erected in 1880. In the neighbourhood there are extensive collieries, and coke is largely manufactured. Besides the large concern of the Butterley Iron Company, which includes foundries, blast furnaces, and boiler works, the town possesses silk and cotton mills. The charter for the market was granted by Henry III. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 1211 acres) in 1871 was 5639, and in 1881 it was 6087.
