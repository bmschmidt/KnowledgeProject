RAPHAEL (רפאל, “God heals ”) first appears in litera-ture in the book of Tobit, where in human disguise and under the name of Azarias (“God helps ”) he accompanies Tobias in his adventurous journey and conquers the demon Asmodaeus. He is said to be “one of the seven angels [archangels] who present the prayers of the saints and enter into the presence of the glory of the Holy One.” In the book of Enoch Raphael is the angel of the spirits of man, and it is his business to gather the souls of the dead in the place where they are reserved till the day of judg-ment,—a conception which seems to imply a derivation from רפאים, “ghosts.” In later Midrash Raphael appears as the angel commissioned to put down the evil spirits that vexed the sons of Noah with plagues and sicknesses after the flood, and he it was who taught men the use of simples and furnished materials for the “Book of Noah,” the earliest treatise on materia medica (Rönsch, Buch der Jubiläen , p. 385 sq.).
