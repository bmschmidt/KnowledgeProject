RAVAILLAC François (1578-1610), the assassin of Henry IV. of France, was born near Angoulême in 1578. He was of humble origin, and began life as a valet de chambre, but afterwards became a petty solicitor and also teacher of a school. He was not able, however, to keep clear of debt, and after having been imprisoned for some time by his creditors he sought admission to the recently founded order of Feuillants, but after a short probation was dismissed as a visionary. An application for admission to the Society of Jesus was equally unsuccessful in 1606. His various disappointments tended to foster a violently fanatical temperament, and widely-spread rumours that the king was intending to make war upon the pope suggested to him the idea of assassination, which he deliberately and successfully carried out on 14th May 1610. In the course of his trial he was frequently put to the torture, but persistently (and it is now believed truly) denied that he had been prompted by any one or had any accomplices. Sentence of death was carried out with revolting barbarity on 27 th May.
