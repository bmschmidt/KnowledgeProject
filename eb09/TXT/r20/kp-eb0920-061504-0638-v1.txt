ROCKHAMPTON a town of Queensland, is situated some 40 miles up the Fitzroy river, nearly on the Tropic of Capricorn. The streets are well formed and kept, bordered by trees, with ever-flowing water down the channels. Embosomed in hills, it has a climate, in spite of heat, of singular salubrity, the death-rate being only about half that of London. The population in 1884 -was about 11,000. Rockhampton is the gateway to a fine pastoral interior and is a port of export for wool. The hills in its neighbourhood are rich in metallic wealth; and Mount Morgan, 30 miles from Rockhampton, seems likely to eclipse the production of Victoria and New South Wales. If anything be needed to complete the prospective importance of Rockhampton, it is the growing development of sugar plantations at no great distance from the town.
