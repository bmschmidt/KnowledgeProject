ROMANUS III. (Argyrus), emperor of the East, was an accomplished but otherwise undistinguished member of the Byzantine aristocracy when, summoned to the palace of the dying Constantine VIII., he was informed that ho had been selected to marry one of the imperial princesses and succeed the emperor. His hesitation as already a married man was removed by his wife, who generously took the veil; and his union with Zoe and their joint coronation were celebrated on 19th November 1028. Two days later Constantine died. A serious defeat which Romanus sustained in person at Azaz in Syria, when marching to take possession of Aleppo, considerably impaired the popularity among his subjects which he had sought to purchase by lavish concession to various classes, and soon afterwards he began to show symptoms of disease, attributed by many to slow poison administered by connivance of the empress. His death took place on 11th April 1034, and he was forthwith succeeded by Michael IV. (q.v.).
