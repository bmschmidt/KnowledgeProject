RHADAMANTHUS in Greek mythology, a son of Zeus and Europa and brother of Minos, king of Crete. At first he helped his brother to rule his island empire. His justice earned him the admiration of his subjects and the jealousy of his brother, wherefore he fled to Boeotia, where he wedded Alcmene. On account of his inflexible integrity he was made one of the judges of the dead in the other world. According to Plato, Rhadamanthus judged the souls of Asiatics, while Aeacus judged those of Europeans, and when they could not agree Minos had a casting vote.
