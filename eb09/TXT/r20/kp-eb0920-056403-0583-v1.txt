RIONERO IN VOLTURE a city of Italy, in the province of Potenza, 4 miles from Atelia, is pleasantly situated at the foot of Monte Voiture, has the repute of being the best built and best kept of the towns of the Basilicata, and has long been distinguished by the industrious character of its inhabitants (11,383 in 1881). It does not seem to be older than the first half of the 17th century. In 1851 it suffered severely from the earthquake.
