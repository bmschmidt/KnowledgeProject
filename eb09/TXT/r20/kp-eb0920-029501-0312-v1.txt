RAUPACH Ernst Benjamin Salomo (1784-1852), German dramatic writer, was born on the 21st of April 1784 at Straupitz, a village near Liegnitz in Silesia. He attended the gymnasium at Liegnitz and afterwards studied theology at Halle. He spent a good many years in Russia as a teacher, and in 1816 was made a professor in the university of St Petersburg. In 1822 he left Russia, and after travelling for some time in Italy settled as a writer for the stage in Berlin, where he remained during the rest of his life. He died at Berlin on the 18th of March 1852.

Raupach was not a man of imaginative genius, but he had remarkable skill in the invention of effective dramatic situations, and was master of a vigorous rhetorical style. These qualities secured for him a prominent place among the most popular dramatic writers of his day. He wrote both tragedies ana comedies, and was the author of a series of dramas representing the great events of the age of the Hohenstaufen.
