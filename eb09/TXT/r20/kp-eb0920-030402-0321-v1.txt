REALEJO a town and harbour on the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, situated in the neighbourhood of 12Â° 28' N. lat. The harbour is spacious and well sheltered, and altogether the best which Nicaragua possesses on that coast; it is protected by a peninsula and two considerable islands, Cardon and Asserradores or Corinto. The town lies 9 miles inland, and as a port is now superseded by the new town of Corinto, founded about 1849, and since 1881 connected with Leon and the interior by a railway. Realejo was the terminus adopted by Bedford Pirn for his scheme of an interoceanic canal; but the route actually sanctioned reaches the coast of the Pacific at Brito, some distance to the south.
