(3) Rio Grande do Sul, the outlet of the Lagδa dos Patos, wrongly supposed by the early explorers to be the mouth of a great river, gives its name to a city and province of Brazil (see below). (4) Rio Grande, a river of Western Africa, enters the sea opposite the Bissagos Archipelago (see Senegambia).
