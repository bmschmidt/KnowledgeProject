RASTRICK an urban sanitary district in the West Riding of Yorkshire, is situated on an acclivity near the Calder, and on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway 5 miles south-east of Halifax and 3Â½ north of Huddersfield. It possesses woollen and silk manufactures, and there are stone quarries in the neighbourhood. The ancient chapel of St Matthew was replaced in 1798 by a church in the Grecian style, which was restored in 1879. A school was founded in 1701 by Mrs Mary Law, who also endowed a charity for poor widows. The population of the urban sanitary district (area, 1371 acres) in 1871 was 5896, and in 1881 it was 8039.
