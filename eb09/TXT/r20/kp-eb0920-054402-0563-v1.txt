RICHELIEU Louis François Armand du Plessis, Duc de, marshal of France and grand-nephew of Cardinal Richelieu, was born in Paris, 13th March 1696, and died in the same city 8th August 1788. Besides his reputation as the most scandalous Lovelace of a scandalous age, he attained, in spite of a deplorably defective education, distinction as a diplomatist and general. As ambassador to Vienna (1725-1729) he settled in 1727 the preliminaries of peace; in 1745 he helped to gain the victory of Fontenoy; three years afterwards he made a brilliant defence of Genoa; in 1756 he expelled the English from Minorca by the capture of the San Felipe fortress; and in 1757-1758 he closed his military career by those pillaging campaigns in Hanover which procured him the sobriquet of Petit Père de la Maraude. In his early days he was thrice imprisoned in the Bastille,— in 1711 at the instance of his stepfather, in 1716 in consequence of a duel, and in 1719 for his share in Alberoni’s conspiracy against the Regent. He was thrice married: first, against his will, at the age of fourteen to Mademoiselle de Noailles; secondly, in 1734, by the intrigues (according to the witty Frenchman’s own account) of Voltaire, to Mademoiselle de Guise; and thirdly, when he was eighty-four years old, to an Irish lady. Marshal Richelieu’s Mémoires published by Soulavie in nine volumes (1790) are partially spurious.
