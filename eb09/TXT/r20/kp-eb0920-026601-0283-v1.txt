RAMESWARAM, a small island situated between Ceylon and India, at the entrance of Palk Strait in the Gulf of Manaar, in 9° 18' N. lat. and 79° 22' E. long. It is about 14 miles long by 5 wide, is low and sandy, and for the most part uncultivated. The estimated population of the island is about 14,000. It contains one of the most venerated Hindu shrines, founded, according to tradition, by Rama himself, which for centuries has been the resort of thousands of pilgrims from all parts of India. To the south of this great temple there is a freshwater lake about 3 miles in circumference. At the western extremity of the island is the small but busy port of Pambam, which gives its name to the channel between India and Ceylon.

Rameswaram island is the first link in the chain of islets and rocks forming Adam’s Bridge. Geological evidence shows that this gap was once bridged by a continuous isthmus, which, according to the temple records, was breached by a violent storm in 1480. Operations for removing the obstacles in the channel, and for deepening and widening it, were begun in 1838. The main channel has a minimum depth of 14 feet; its length is 4232 feet and its breadth 80 feet. A second channel to the south, called the Kilkarai Passage, is 2100 feet long, 150 feet wide, and is dredged to a depth of 12 feet.
