GUARDI, Francesco (1712-1793), a Venetian painter, was a pupil of Canaletto, and followed his style so closely that his pictures are very frequently attributed to his more celebrated master. Nevertheless, the diversity, when once perceived, is sufficiently marked,—Canaletto being morefirm, solid, distinct, well-grounded, and on the whole the higher master, while Guardi is noticeable for spirited touch, sparkling colour, and picturesquely sketched figures—in these respects being fully equal to Canaletto. Guardi sometimes coloured Canaletto’s designs. He had extraordinary facility, three or four days being enough for producing an entire work. The number of his performances is large in proportion to this facility, and to the love of gain which characterized our painter. Many of his works are to be found in England; seven in the Louvre; four, of exceptional merit, in the Manfrini Palace, Venice.
