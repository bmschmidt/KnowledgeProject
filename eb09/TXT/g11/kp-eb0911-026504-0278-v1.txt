GUISBOROUGH, or Gisborough, a market-town of England, North Riding of Yorkshire, is situated in a narrow but fertile valley at the foot of the Cleveland Hills, 4 miles from the mouth of the Tees and 10 miles E.S.E. of Middlesborough. It consists chiefly of one wide and handsome street, having many good houses. The principal buildings are the parish church, which though partly rebuilt in 1791 and thoroughly renovated in 1875, has some remains of an ancient structure; the free grammar school, founded in 1561; the town-hall, recently much improved and enlarged; the mechanicsâ€™ institute, the hospital for old men and women, and the hospital for accidents erected lately by Admiral Chaloner. The ruins of the Austin priory, founded in 1129, are beautifully situated near the eastern extremity of the town. The accumulation of rubbish has been recently removed from its foundations and floors, and a large number of interesting relics discovered. Among the historic personages who were buried within its walls was Robert the Bruce,, lord of Annandale, the competitor for the throne of Scotland with John Baliol, and the grandfather of King Robert Bruce. The town within late years has been rapidly increasing, on account of the iron mines in its neighbourhood: and it has also tanneries and breweries. Alum works were established in the reign of Queen Elizabeth by Sir Thomas Chaloner, who introduced the manufacture of alum into England from Italy; but they have been long discontinued. About a mile south-east of the town there is a sulphurous spring discovered in 1822, efficacious in cutaneous, rheumatic, and bilious complaints. The population of the town in 1871 was 5202, and in 1879 about 6500.
