GRAZALEMA (the Roman Lacidulermium}, a town of Spain, in the province of Cadiz, is situated on the great road from Cadiz to Ronda, 60 miles E.N.E. of Cadiz. It stands in a very strong position on a rocky hill, and to capture it was reckoned one of the chief feats of the esforzÎ±do Rodrigo Ponce de Leon. It possesses three hermitages, a parish church, and a convent. The manufactures are chiefly woollen, linen, leather, and soap, and there is considerable trade in sheep and swine from the neighbouring sierra of the same name. Inscriptions and other Roman antiquities still exist in the town. The population is about 6000.
