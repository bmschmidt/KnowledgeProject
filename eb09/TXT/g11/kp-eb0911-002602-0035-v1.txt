GRACKLE (Latin, Graeculus or Graculus), a word which has been much used in ornithology, but generally in a vague sense, though restricted to members of the families Stumidoe belonging to the Old World, and Iderùloe belonging to the New. Of the former those to which it has been most commonly applied are the species variously known as Mynas, Mainas, and Minors of India and the adjacent countries, and especially the Grαculα religiosa of Linnaeus, who, according to Jerdon and others, was very probably led to confer this epithet upon it by confounding it with the Sturnus or Acridοtheres tristis, ^[1. By some writers the birds of the genera AcridolJιcrcs and Temeηwhus are considered to be the true Mynas, and the species of Grαculα are called “Hill Mynas” by way of distinction.] which is regarded by the Hindus as sacred to Ram Deo, one of their deities, while the true Gracula religiosa does not seem to be anywhere held in veneration. This last is about 10 inches in length, clothed in a plumage of glossy black, with purple and green reflexions, and a conspicuous patch of white on the quillfeathers of the wings. The bill is orange and the legs yellow, but the bird’s most characteristic feature is afforded by the curious wattles of bright yellow, which, beginning behind the eyes, run backwards in form of a lappet on each side, and then return in a narrow stripe to the top of the head. Beneath each eye also is a bare patch of the same colour. This species is common in southern India, and is represented further to the north, in Ceylon, Burmah, and some of the [9:11:27] Malay Islands by cognate forms. They are all frugivorous, and, being easily tamed and learning to pronounce words very distinctly, are favourite cage-birds.^[2. For a valuable monograph on the various species of Grαculα and its allies see Prof. Schlegel’s Bijdrage tot de Keηηis van het Geschlackt Beo (Nederlandsch TιjdschriTt voor de Bierkunde, i. pp. 1-9).]

In the New World the name Grackle has been applied to several species of the genera Scolecophagus and Quiscalus, though these are more commonly called in the United States and Canada “Blackbirds,” and some of them “Boat-tails.” They all belong to the family Icteridoe. The best known of these are the Rusty Grackle, S. ferrugineus, which pervades almost the whole of North America, aud Q. purpureus, the Purple Grackle or Crow-Blackbird, of more limited range, for though abundant enough in 1n03t parts to the east of the Rocky Mountains, it seems not to appear on the Pacific side. There is also Brewer’s or the Blue-headed Grackle, Ä cyaηocephalus, which has a more western range, not occurring to the eastward of Kansas and Minnesota. A fourth species, Q. major, is also found to inhabit the Atlantic States as far aβ North Carolina. All these birds are of exceedingly omnivorous habit, and though undoubtedly destroying large numbers of pernicious insects are in many places held in bad repute from the mischief they do to the corn-crops, (a. n )
