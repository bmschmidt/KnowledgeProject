GRONOVIUS, or GRONOV, Johann Friedrich (1613—1671), scholar and critic, was born at Hamburg, 20th September 1613. He went through his early studies with great distinction at Bremen, and afterwards attended the universities of Leipsic, Jena, and Altorf, whence he extended his travels into France and Italy. In 1643 he was appointed professor of rhetoric and history at Deventer, and in 1658 he succeeded Daniel Heinsius in the Greek chair at Leyden, where he died on the 28th of December 1671.

Besides editing, with notes, Statius, Plautus, Livy, Pliny, Tacitus, Aulus Gellius, and Seneca’s tragedies, he was the author of numerous works which have been exhaustively catalogued by Chauffepié and others. They include De Sestertiis, sive subsecivorum Pecuniae veteris Graecae et Romanae Libri IV (1643), and notes upon Seneca, Phaedrus, &c., which were subsequently utilized by his son Jacobus Gronovius in his editions of those authors.
