GYARMAT, a Magyar term signifying colony, and applied to several places in Hungary. Of these the following two towns have the largest number of inhabitants.

Balassa-Gyakmat, capital of the Cis-Danubian county of Négrâd, is situated on the Ipoly (Eipel), about 40 miles N.N.E. of Budapest, 48° 6' N. lat., 19° 16' E. long. It is the seat of a royal court of law and of the assizes, and has Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches, also a Jews’ synagogue, a fine county hall, a house of correction, a religious institute for girls, and tax, post, and telegraph offices. In 1870 the population was 6435, Magyars and Slavs by nationality.

Füzes-Gyarmat, a market-town in the Trans-Tibiscan county of Békés, is somewhat unfavourably situated in the extensive marshy tract of country known as the Sârrét, 47° 5' N. lat., 21° 13' E. long. The town has few noteworthy buildings, with the exception of the Calvinist church and some elegant private residences. The chief products of the rich, dark, alluvial βoil of the neighbourhood are wheat, tobacco, hay, grapes, and other fruits. Horned cattle, pigs, and sheep (both merino and Hungarian) are bred on the wide-spreading pasture-lands, and numerous water-fowl and wading birds, especially herons, inhabit the reed-covered marshes. The water used for drinking purposes is, however, frequently muddy and warm, and unpleasant to the taste. In 1870 the population was 5735, of whom the great majority were Magyars.
