GYULA, chief town of the Trans-Tibiscan county of Békés, Hungary, is favourably situated on the Fehér (White) Körös, and has a well-built station on the Nagy-Vârad (Grosswardein) and Eszék line of the Alföld-Fiume Railway, in 46° 38' N. lat., 21° 17' E. long. The outer ditch of the old ruined fortress, the tower of which serves as a prison, divides Gyula into two parts, named respectively Magyar-Vâros (Hungarian-town) and Német-Vâros (German-town). Stone bridges facilitate communication over the canals, which flow from the Körös, and intersect the streets. Among the principal buildings are Roman Catholic, Old United Greek, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, and a Jews’ synagogue, also a fine castle with gardens, a county hall, an ancient Turkish bath, many handsome private residences, and several oil-mills. Gyula is, moreover, the seat of the county assemblies and administration, of a royal court of justice, of the assizes, and of a board of taxes, and has post and telegraph offices, and a savings-bank. The inhabitants are employed partly in industrial and commercial pursuits, partly in farming and cattle-breeding. The fairs are much resorted to for the purchase of corn, horned cattle, sheep, pigs, wooden wares, and gall-nuts. The chief agricultural products of the surrounding country are wheat, barley, oats, and maize; there is also a good supply of garden fruit, grapes, and vegetables. In 1870 the population amounted to 18,495, consisting chiefly of Magyars, Wallachs, and Germans.
