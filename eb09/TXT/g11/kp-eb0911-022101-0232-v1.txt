GROTON, a post town of New London county, Connecticut, U.S., is situated on the rivers Mystic and Pequonnock, opposite New London, and on the east side of the river Thames at its junction w ith Long Island Sound. There are granite quarries in the neighbourhood, and the town possesses manufactures of cotton goods, britannia ware, carriages, and sashes and blinds, and brass and iron foundries. There is also a considerable coasting trade, and shipping and fishing are carried on to a small extent. On the heights behind the town stands Fort Griswold, which surrendered to the British troops, September 6, 1781. The majority of its defenders, including the commander Colonel Ledyard, were put to death after they had surrendered; and a granite monument was erected in the town to their memory in 1830. The population in 1870 was 5124.
