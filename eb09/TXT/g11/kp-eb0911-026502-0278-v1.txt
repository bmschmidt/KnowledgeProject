GUINGAMP, a town of France, capital of an arrondissement in the department of Côtes-du-Nord, is situated in a large and rich valley on the right bank of the Trieux, 20 miles W.N.W. of St Brieuc. It was formerly surrounded by walls, portions of which still exist. It has a library, a museum, a prison, and a hospital dating from the 17th century, enlarged in 1830, and having within its grounds an old oak of immense size. There are also several old buildings of interest, including the beautiful church of Notre Dame du Bon-Secours, portions of which date from the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries respectively, and which has been lately restored; four pillars of the tower of the chapel of Saint Leonard, dating from the 11th century; and the Ursuline convent, dating from the 17th century, now used as a cavalry depot. The beautiful fouutain in the Place de Plomb, constructed by Italian artists in the 15th century, was replaced in 1743 by the present structure. The town has manufactures of ginghams (to which it gives the name), linen fabrics, thread, leather, and hats; and there is some trade in wine, brandy, cattle, and agricultural produce. Guingamp originally belonged to the dukes of Penthièvre, and was inherited from them by King Louis Philippe. The papulation in 1876 was 7895.
