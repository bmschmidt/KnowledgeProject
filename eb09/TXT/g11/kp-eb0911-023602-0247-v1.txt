GUARATINGUETA, a town of Brazil, in the province of Sâo Paulo, situated near the right bank of the Parahiba, about 40 miles N.E. of the city of Sâo Paulo. It was founded in 1651 by the Captain Mor Dionizio da Costa. The houses are almost all constructed of mud, and there are few buildings of any note except the churches, of which the chief is dedicated to St Anthony. A considerable traffic is fostered by the fertile character of the surrounding district and the situation of Guaratingueta on the road between Sào Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Population 7400. According to Spix an i Martius the name of the town is equivalent to “the place where the sun turns,” and refers to its vicinity to the tropic of Capricorn. See Milliet de Saint-Adolphe, Dicciσn. Geogr. do imperio do Brazil, 1870.
