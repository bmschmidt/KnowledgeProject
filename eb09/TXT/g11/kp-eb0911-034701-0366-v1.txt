GYERGYÓ-SZENT-MIKLÓS, a market-town of Hungary, in the Transylvanian county of Csik, is situated in a mountainous but well-wooded district, 96 miles E. of Klausenburg, and about 25 W. of the Moldavian frontier, 46' 42' N. lat., 25° 33' E. long. Among the more important buildings are a Roman and a Greek Catholic church, a fine public school, a royal court of justice, and the post and telegraph offices. There are also cattle and timber trading houses, an office of woods, a financial commission agency, aud a police station. Cattle and sheep are reared in great numbers in the surrounding country, which is noted also for its cheeses, and for the preparation of gin. The number of inhabitants at the commencement of 1870 was 5645, consisting of Magyars, Wallachs, and Magyarized Armenians, the descendants of a band of wanderers who settled here in 1668.
