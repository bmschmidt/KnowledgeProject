GUNTOOR, a town in Kistna district, Madras, situated on the Grand Trunk road, about 46 miles from Masulipatam, 17° 42' N. 1at., 80° 29' E. long.; population 18,033. It is the headquarters of the sub-collector and the district judge of Kistna; and there is a considerable trade in grain and cotton. Guntoor was formerly the capital of a Circar (Sarkâr) under the Mahometans; it was ceded to the French by the nizâm in 1753. At the time of the cession of the Circars to the English in 1766, Guntoor was specially exempted during the life of Basâlat Jang, whose personal jdgιr it was. In 1788 it came into British possession, and was finally confirmed in 1803.
