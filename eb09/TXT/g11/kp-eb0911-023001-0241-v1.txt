GUADIX, a city of Spain, in the province of Granada, situated on an elevated plateau on the northern slope of the Sierra Nevada, and above the left bank of the river Guadix. It is surrounded by ancient walls, and was formerly dominated by a Moorish castle, now in ruins. It is said to have been the first episcopal see erected in Spain; it still is a bishopric, suffragan to Granada, but the cathedral is architecturally unimportant. The town was once famous for its cutlery; but its modern manufactures (chiefly earthenware, hempen goods, and hats) are inconsiderable. It has some trade in wool, cotton, flax, corn, and liqueurs. The population is estimated at 10,150. The warm mineral springs of Graena, much frequented by Spaniards during the summer season, at , e situated 4âˆ£ miles to the westward.
