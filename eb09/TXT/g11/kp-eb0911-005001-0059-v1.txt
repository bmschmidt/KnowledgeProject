GRANMICHELE, or Grammichele, a market-town of Sicily, in the province of Catania, about 8 miles from Caltagirone on the road to Catania. It lies on the side of a hill, the summit of which is crowned by a castle which, along with the town itself, was formerly a fief of the Brancatelli Butera family. Beautiful marble is found in the vicinity, and the inhabitants, who in 1871 numbered 10,058, trade in oil.
