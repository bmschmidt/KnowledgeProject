GOYA, a town of the Argentine Republic, in the province of Corrientes, near the junction of a small stream with the Paranâ, about 100 miles S. of Corrientes. The streets are about 60 feet wide, and the houses, built of brick, are often two stories high. One side of the handsome plaza is occupied by a large church erected by local subscription, and in the centre there is a pyramid 50 feet high. Hides, wool, cheese, and oranges are the principal articles of trade, the cheese especially findiug a good market at Buenos Ayres and elsewhere. The town was founded in 1807 by the national Government, and is said to have derived its name from Goya or Gregoria, the wife of the Portuguese cattlefarmer who was formerly settled on the spot. The population, which includes a large foreign element,—Italians, Bisques, and French,—amounted to 10,907 in 1869. See Mulhall’s Handbook of the River Plate.
