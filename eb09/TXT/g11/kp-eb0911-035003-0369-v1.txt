GYÖNGYÖS, the second town in importance of Heves county, Hungary, is situated at the foot of the Mâtra, south-west of Eger (Erlau), and is connected by a branch liue with the Budapest-Miskolcz royal state railway, 47° 47' N. lat., 19° 59' E. long. Gyöngyös is the seat of a court of justice, and of a board of taxes, and contains three churches, a large monastic establishment belonging to the Franciscans, a gymnasium, manufactories of leather, hats, and woollen cloth, and distilleries. The town carries on a brisk trade, especially in the Vissontaer and Egri (Erlauer) red wines, which are produced in great Quantities in the [9:11:351] neighbourhood. In 1870 the population was 15,830, mostly Magyars by nationality. The Hungarians defeated the Austrians at Gyöngyös on the 3d April 1849.
