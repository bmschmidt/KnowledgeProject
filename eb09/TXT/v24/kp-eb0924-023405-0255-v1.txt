VINCENT, George (1796-1831 ?), English landscape and marine painter, was born at Norwich in June 1796. He studied art under “Old” Crome, and at the age of fifteen began to contribute to the Norwich exhibition. From 1814 till 1823 he exhibited occasionally at the Royal Academy, and also in the Water-Colour Exhibition and the British Institution. In 1819 he removed from Norwich to London, and he was a contributor to the Suffolk Street gallery from its foundation in 1824 till 1830. He possessed great artistic abilities; but unfortunately he fell into dissipation, and his works became slight and hastily executed. Finally he dropped out of sight, and he is believed to have died about 1831. His most important work, a View of Greenwich Hospital, was shown in [9:24:235] the International Exhibition of 1862. His London from the Surrey Side of Waterloo Bridge is also a fine work.
