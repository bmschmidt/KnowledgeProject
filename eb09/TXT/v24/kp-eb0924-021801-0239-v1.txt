VICTORIA, capital of British Columbia and the principal town of Vancouver Island, in the south-east corner of which it is finely situated (48° 25' 20" N. lat., 123° 22' 24" W. long.), on a small arm of the sea, its harbour, however, only admitting vessels drawing 18 feet. The city has some fine streets, handsome villas and public buildings, Government offices, and churches. There are several schools, public and private, a free library, a theatre, a mechanics’ institute, and a public park. The water supply is good. The town, which is connected by cable with the mainland, is a favourite holiday resort for the Columbians. Till 1858 Victoria was a post of the Hudson Bay Company. The city was incorporated in 1862; and, according to the census of 1886, the population was 14,000, including Chinese and Indians, spread over an area of 4 square miles.
