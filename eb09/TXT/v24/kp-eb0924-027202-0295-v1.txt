VOGHERA (Vicus Prix), a town of Italy, in the province of Pavia, and 19 miles by rail to the south-southwest of that city, on the Staffora, formerly the Iria (a tributary of the Po), here crossed by a fine bridge. The fortifications erected by the Visconti in the Middle Ages have given place to a series of shady promenades. The large church of San Lorenzo dates its foundation from the 11th century, but was remodelled in the baroco style about the beginning of the 17th. The neighbourhood is fertile and produces much silk, in which, as well as in corn and wine, an active trade is carried on. The population in 1881 was 10,785.
