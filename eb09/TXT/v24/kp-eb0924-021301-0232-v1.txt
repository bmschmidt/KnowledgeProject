VICTOR I., St, bishop of Rome from about 190 to 202, succeeded Eleutherus and was followed by Zephyrinus. His name is chiefly associated with a display of intolerance towards the bishops of Asia Minor for the view they took in the Quartodeciman controversy (see Easter ; also Popedom, vol. xix. p. 489); he also excommunicated Theodotus of Byzantium on account of his doctrine as to the Person of Christ (see Monarchianism).
