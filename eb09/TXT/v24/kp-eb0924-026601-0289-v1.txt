VITTORIA, an inland town of Sicily, in the Italian province of Syracuse, about 18 miles by road east-southeast from Terranova, stands in the midst of a rich vine and olive district, which also produces silk, rice, and honey. The population in 1881 was 21,755. It is quite a modern town,â€”founded towards the beginning of the 17th century. The principal church (San Giovanni) dates from 1854.
