VENLO, a frontier town of Holland, in the province of Limburg, on the right bank of the Meuse (here crossed by a bridge), is an important railway junction; Cologne lies 60 miles to the south-east and Maestricht 43 miles to the south-west. The population, which is somewhat closely packed, was 8494 in 1876 and 10,550 in 1887. None of the public buildings has any special interest attaching to it. The leading industries are distilling, brewing, tanning, spinning, needle-making, and tobacco manufacture. There is considerable trade by river with Rotterdam. Venlo was at one time a place of strength, but the fortifications were dismantled in 1868.
