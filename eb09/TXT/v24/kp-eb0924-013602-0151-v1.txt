VELEZ-M√ÅLAGA, a town of Spain, in the province of Malaga, and 15 miles east-north-east from that town, is finely situated in a fertile valley at the foot of steep mountains (Sierra Tejada), within a mile of the mouth of the small river Velez. Formerly it was a place of considerable commercial importance, but its prosperity has much declined in recent years, and it suffered severely in the earthquakes of 1884. It is associated with many [9:24:137] romantic events in the history of the Moorish wars, to which period its old castle belongs. The vegetation of the neighbourhood is most luxuriant, including the aloe, palm, sugar-cane, prickly pear, orange, vine, olive, and sweet potato. The inhabitants are chiefly employed in the various industries connected with the cultivation and export of the products of these. There is also a tunny fishery. The population within the municipal boundaries in 1877 was 24,332.
