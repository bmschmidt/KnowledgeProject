VEGLIA (Slavonic, Krk), an island in the Gulf of Quarnero, Adriatic Sea, belonging to the Austrian district of Istria, is separated from the mainland by the narrow channel of Morlacca or Maltempo and from the island of Cherso on the south-west by that of Mezzo. It is 24 miles long and about 14 miles across at its widest part. The surface is mostly rugged and mountainous; but the central, southern, and western districts are fertile, producing wine, grain, oil, timber, and various kinds of fruit, besides pasturage for numerous live-stock. Silk, marble, and salt are also produced; and fishing is carried on along the coast. In 1880 the island contained 18,089 inhabitants; the capital is Veglia, a town on the south-west side, with 1580 inhabitants and a good harbour.
