VALS, or Vals-lès-Bains, a village of France, in the department of Ardèche, with a population of 2186 in 1886, is noted chiefly for its alkaline waters, which are similar to those of Vichy (see vol. xvi. p. 435). Within the commune, which in 1886 had a population of 3911, paper is manufactured to a small extent, and some silk is spun.
