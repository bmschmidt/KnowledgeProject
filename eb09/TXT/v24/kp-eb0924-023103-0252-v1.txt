VILLENA, a town of Spain, in the province of Alicante, is situated 37 miles by rail to the north-west of that town, on the right bank of the little river Vinalapo. It has narrow winding streets, and is crowned by a picturesque-looking old castle. The slopes of the surrounding hills are clothed with vines, and there are also some extensive salt lagoons. The annual fair of Villena (29th Sept.-5th Oct.), dealing in the produce of the neighbourhood, is still of considerable importance. The industries (soap-making, weaving, distilling) are not extensive. The population within the municipal boundaries in 1877 was 11,424.
