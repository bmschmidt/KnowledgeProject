VOTKINSK, an iron-work in the Urals, in the Russian government of Vyatka, 47 miles north of Sarapul, and 8 miles from the Kama, was founded in 1756. Its population reached 15,480 in 1885. Together with the Kamsk iron-work, Votkinsk was till lately one of the chief Government establishments for the construction of steamers for the Caspian flotilla, as well as of locomotives for the Siberian railway, and it has long been renowned for its excellent tarantasses and other smaller iron-wares, as well as for its knitted goods. No large orders having been received from the Government, a number of workmen recently united into an “artel” or co-operative society for the manufacture of agricultural machinery, already known throughout Russia for its excellence and cheapness.
