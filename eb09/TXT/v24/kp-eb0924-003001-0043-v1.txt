VÁCZ (Germ. Waitzen), a market town in Hungary, on the left bank of the Danube, 20 miles north of Buda-Pesth. It gives its name to a Roman Catholic bishopric (established by Stephen, first king of Hungary, in 1000) and various schools, convents, and charities connected therewith, and has a state deaf and dumb institute and a central Government prison. The cathedral, a magnificent structure, is an imitation of St Peter’s at Rome, with mediaeval relics and pictures. The majority of the inhabitants are engaged in agriculture and cattle-breeding; but exportation of grapes from the neighbouring hilly district is also largely carried on. Vácz is a station on the Austrian-Hungarian railway system. The population, mostly Magyars by nationality, was 13,199 in 1880, and in 1887 was estimated to number nearly 17,000.
