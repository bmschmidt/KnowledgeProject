MOZARAB, Spanish Moz√†rdbe, is a corruption of the Arabic Musta'rib, coll. Musta t riba, which denotes persons not Arab by race who have assimilated themselves to the Arabs. This name was applied by the Moslems in Spain to the Christian communities existing among them, in Cordova, Seville, Toledo, and other large cities, in the exercise of their own laws and religion. The ancient liturgy (see vol. xiv. p. 707) used by the Christians of Toledo, the first great body of this kind who were freed from the Moslem yoke, is commonly known as Mozarabic.
