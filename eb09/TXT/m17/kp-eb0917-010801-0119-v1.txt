MUSKEGON, a city of the United States, the county seat of Muskegon county, Michigan, at the upper end of Muskegon Lake, a fine sheet of water formed by the Muskegon river before it falls into Lake Michigan. The staple trade is in lumber, which is floated down the river, worked up by its saw-mills and planing-mills, and exported by boat and rail. The cut of lumber in the season of 1882 was 650,000,000 feet. There are also car, engine, and boiler works, and various manufactories of wooden ware. The population increased from 6002 in 1870 to 11,262 in 1880. Settled in 1836, and laid out in 1853, Muskegon was incorporated as a village in 1861 and as a city in 1870.
