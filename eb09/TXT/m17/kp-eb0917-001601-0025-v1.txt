MÜLHEIM-AM-RHEIN, the chief town of a circle in the district of Cologne, Prussia, lies on the right bank of the Rhine, 2 miles below Cologne. It is a pretty and well-built town, with important manufactures of silk, velvet, ribbons, sail-cloth, belting for machinery, leather articles, yarn, and chemicals. It also contains a rollingmill, boiler-works, telegraph-works, malt manufactories, several breweries, and a shipbuilding yard. Mülheim carries on a brisk trade by rail and river, serving as an outlet for the manufactures of Bensberg and Gladbach, and for the wines of the upper Rhine, Nahe, and Moselle. Its educational institutions include a flourishing weaving school and a “real school” of the first class. The most striking building is the modern Gothic church. Though of ancient foundation, Mülheim did not receive a municipal charter till 1587. Its industrial prosperity is in great part due to the influx of Protestants expelled from Cologne at the beginning of the 17th century. The population in 1880 was 20,420.
