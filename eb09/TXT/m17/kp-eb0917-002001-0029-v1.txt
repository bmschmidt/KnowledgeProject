MULTIPLEPOINDING is the technical term for a form of action in Scotch law by which conflicting claims to the same fund or property are determined. The action is brought either by the holder or by a claimant in his name. All who have any claims in the fund or property in question are ordered to appear and give in their claims; the court then prefers them according to their respective rights, and the holder of the fund or property in dispute on payment or delivery is absolved from any further claim in regard to it.
