MUROM, a district town of Russia in the province of Vladimir, on the craggy left bank of the Oka close by its junction with the Tesha, 107 miles by rail south-east of Vladimir. Murom is the chief entrepot for grain from the basin of the lower Oka and carries on an active trade with Moscow and Nijni-Novgorod, partly by the Oka, partly by rail, a branch line to Kovroff connecting it with the railway between the towns just mentioned. Murom is still famed, as in ancient times, for kitchen-gardens, raising especially cucumbers and seed for canary-birds. Its once famous tanneries have lost their importance, but the manufacture of linen has greatly increased; it has also steam flour-mills, distilleries, manufactories of soap, &c., and of iron implements. There are also several distilleries in the district. The population is 11,000.
