MULLINGAR, a market-town of Ireland, capital of Westmeath, is situated near the Brosna and on the Royal canal, 44 miles west by north of Dublin. The principal buildings are the parish church with tower and spire, the Roman Catholic church, the court-house, the barracks, and the infirmary. Tanning, brewing, and the manufacture of coarse woollens are carried on. The population in 1881 was 4787. Mullingar was one of the ancient palatinate towns. It possessed an Augustine convent founded in 1227, and a [9:17:19] Dominican convent founded in 1239, but both were dissolved by Elizabeth. The town was the headquarters of William III. before the siege of Athlone. It formerly returned two members to parliament, but was disfranchised at the Union.
