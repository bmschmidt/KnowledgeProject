OPHIR (n'DiK), a place famous among the Hebrews for its gold from the time of Solomon, whose Red Sea fleet, in conjunction with the Phoenicians, went to Ophir and brought thence a vast treasure of gold with precious stones and “almug” wood (1 Kings ix. 28, x. 11). It is quite plain from Gen. x. 29 that Ophir belonged to southern Arabia, from which the Phoenicians still derived gold and precious stones in the time of Ezekiel (xxvii. 22). All attempts to place Ophir in India or on the east coast of Africa (Sofâla) are at variance with Gen. x. It is true that Indian products were also brought to Solomon (1 Kings x. 22), but these are not said to have come from Ophir, and therefore we cannot even be sure that Ophir was the emporium where the Indian trade and the Western met, as they did in southern Arabia in later times,—unless, indeed, the “almug” or “algum” wood is, as has been conjectured, the Indian sandalwood.
