OLIVETANS, a monastic order, that of Our Lady of Monte Oliveto, following the Benedictine rule, was founded about the year 1313 by Bernardo Tolomei of Siena (see Monachism). The mother-house at Monte Oliveto Maggiore, about 19 miles to the south of Siena, is a favourable specimen of a great Benedictine monastery; the church and library contain some fine inlaid work by Fra Giovanni da Verona (1502-1505), and the court has celebrated frescos by Luca Signorelli and Ant. Bazzi (Soddoma).
