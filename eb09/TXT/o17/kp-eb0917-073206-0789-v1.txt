OGDEN, a flourishing city of the United States, in [9:17:733] Weber county, Utah, 37 miles by rail north of Salt Lake City, at the confluence of the Weber and Ogden rivers. It is one of the most important railway junctions of the Western States; the Union Pacific, the Central Pacific, and the Utah Central Railroads, as well as a line which will ultimately join the Northern Pacific at Garrison, all meet at this point. The ground-plan of the city is spacious, the drainage good, and the climate exceedingly healthy. In manufactures and general industry it bids fair to rival Salt Lake City. Conspicuous among its buildings are the court-house with its white cupola, and the central school, which is one of the best in Utah. The population was 3127 in 1870, and 6069 in 1880.
