O’BRIEN, William Smith (1803-1864), the head of the “Young Ireland” party, was born on 17th October 1803, and received his education at Harrow and at Cambridge. He entered parliament in 1826 as member for Ennis, and from 1835 to 1848 represented the county of Limerick. Although he spoke in 1828 in favour of Catholic emancipation, he for many years continued to differ on other points from the general policy of O’Connell. He, however, opposed the Irish Arms Act of 1843, and in January 1844 became an active member of the Repeal Association. Though he was destitute of oratorical gifts, his chivalrous devotion to the welfare of his country secured him enthusiastic attachment as a popular leader. In July 1846 he with the “Young Ireland” party left the Repeal Association, and in the beginning of 1847 he established the Irish Confederation. The French Revolution of 1848 stimulated his hopes of success, and incited him to more extreme efforts against the English rule. In May 1848 he was tried at Dublin for sedition, but the jury disagreed. In the following July he established a war directory, and attempted to make a rising among the peasantry of Ballin-garry, but although he was at first joined by a large following the movement wanted cohesion, and the vacillating crowd dispersed as soon as news reached them of the approach of the dragoons. O’Brien was arrested at Thurles, tried, and sentenced to death. The sentence was commuted to transportation for life. In July 1854 he received his liberty on condition of never revisiting the United Kingdom; and in May 1856 he obtained a full pardon. Henceforth he kept aloof from all political movements. In 1856 he published Principles of Government, or Meditations in Exile. He died at Bangor, North Wales, 18th June 1864.
