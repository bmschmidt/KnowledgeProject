ONTENIENTE, an old town of Spain, in the province of Valencia, stands on an elevation on the right bank of the Clariano or Onteniente, a sub-tributary of the Jucar, about 11 miles south-south-west from JÃ¢tiva. It has three churches, a good town-hall, and a palace of the dukes of Almodovar. Linen and woollen cloth, paper, brandy, and earthenware are manufactured; and there is also some trade in the cereals, wine, and oil produced in the neighbouring district, which is very fertile. In 1877 the ayuntamiento had a population of 11,727.
