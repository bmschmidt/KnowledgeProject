ORANGE, a city of the United States, in Essex county, New Jersey, 16 miles west of New York by two lines of railway, and connected by tramway with Newark, 3â…œ miles distant. Beautifully situated on rolling ground about 190 feet above the sea, Orange has become a favourite place of residence for New York business men. To the west lies Llewelyn Park, an area of 750 acres, studded with villas and laid out in common; and the summit of Orange Mountain (650 feet), a little farther west, is also occupied with villas. Hat-making is largely carried on in the city. The population was 9348 in 1870 and 13,207 in 1880. In 1860 the township of Orange received a town charter; and in 1872 the town, diminished by East Orange and parts of South and West Orange, was raised to the rank of a city.
