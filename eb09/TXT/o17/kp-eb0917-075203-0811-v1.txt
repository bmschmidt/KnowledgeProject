OLAUS MAGNUS or MAGNI (Magnus, i.e., Store, being the family name, and not a personal epithet) was born in 1490 and died at Rome in 1558. Like his elder brother, Johannes Magnus, he obtained several ecclesiastical preferments (a canonry at Upsala and at Linkoping), and was employed on various diplomatic services; but on - the success of the Reformation in Sweden his attachment to the old church led him to accompany his brother into exile. Settling at Rome, he ultimately became his brotherâ€™s successor in the titular archbishopric of Upsala. Olaus Magnus is best remembered as the author of Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus (Rome, 1555), a work which long remained for the rest of Europe the chief authority on Swedish matters and is still a valuable repertory of much curious information in regard to Scandinavian customs and folk-lore.
