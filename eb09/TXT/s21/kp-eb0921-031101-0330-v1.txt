SARNO, a city of Italy, in the province of Salerno, 30 miles east of Naples by rail, lies at the foot of the Apennines near the sources of the Sarno, a stream connected by canal with Pompeii and the sea. Besides the cathedral, a basilica erected in 1625 at some distance from the city, Sarno has several interesting churches and the ruins of a mediaeval castle. Paper, cotton, silk, linen, and hemp are manufactured. The population of the town in 1881 was 11,445. Previous to its incorporation with the domains of the crown of Naples, Sarno gave its name to a countship held in succession by the Orsini, Cappola, Suttavilla, and Colonna families.
