SCHWELM, a town of Westphalia, in Prussia, is situated on the river of the same name, 22 miles east of DÃ¼sseldorf and 27 north-east of Cologne. Lying close to the Harkort iron and sulphur mines, within the populous and rich mineral district on the lower Rhine, it carries on ironfounding, wire-drawing, and the manufacture of machinery of various kinds, besides an active trade in iron, steel, and brass goods. Scarcely less important are its manufactures of ribbons, damask, cord, and paper. In the neighbourhood are chalybeate springs, resorted to by invalids. The population in 1880 was 12,127, one-fourth of whom were Roman Catholics. Schweim is said to have existed as early as 1085, though it did not receive town-rights until 1590.
