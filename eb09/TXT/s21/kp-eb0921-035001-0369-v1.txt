SAXIFRAGE (Saxifraga), a genus of plants which gives its name to the order of which it is a member. There are nearly 200 species distributed in the temperate and arctic parts of the northern hemisphere, frequently at considerable heights on the mountains. They are mostly herbs with perennial rootstocks, leaves in tufts, or, on the flower-stalks, scattered. The arrangement of the flowers is very various, as also are the size and colour of the flowers themselves. They have a calyx with a short tube, five petals, ten (or rarely five) stamens springing, like the petals, from the edge of the tube of the calyx. The pistil is partly adherent â€˜to the calyx-tube, and is divided above into two styles. The ovules are numerous, attached to axile placentas. The seed-vessel is capsular. Many species are natives of Britain, some alpine plants of great beauty (S. oppositifolia, S. nivalis, S. aizoides, &c.), and others, like S. granulata, frequenting meadows and low ground, while S. tridactylites may be found on almost any dry wall. Many species are in cultivation, including the Bergenias or Megaseas with their large fleshy leaves and copious panicles of rosy or pink flowers, the numerous alpine species, such as S. pyramidalis, S. Cotyledon, Ac., with tall panicles studded with white flowers, and many others.
