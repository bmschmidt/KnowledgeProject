SCHEVENINGEN, a fishing village and watering-place in Holland, on the North Sea, about two miles from The Hague, with which it is connected by a shaded avenue with a tramway. There is a fine sandy beach below the line of dunes that separate the village from the sea. The terrace crowning the dunes serves as a promenade. Population in 1879, 7713. Scheveningen has a considerable herring fleet. In a naval engagement off the coast in 1673 De Ruyter defeated the combined forces of the French and English.
