SAN REMO, a town and seaport of northern Italy, at the head of a circondario in the province of Porto Maurizio on the Western Riviera, 16¾ miles by rail east of Mentone and 84 1/4 south-west of Genoa. Climbing the slope of a steep hill, it looks south over a small bay of the Gulf of Genoa, and, protected towards the north by hills rising gradually from 500 to 8000 feet, has the reputation of being in climate one of the most favoured places on the whole coast. The narrow stair-like streets of the old town, with their lofty houses, arched gateways, and flying buttresses, form a fine contrast to the modern districts of villas and hotels w’hich have sprung up since about 1860. Besides the Gothic cathedral of San Siro, the buildings of most interest are the Madonna della Costa, crowning the highest part of the old town, the town-house, and the hospital for cutaneous diseases founded by Charles Albert. The port, formed by two moles, both lengthened since 1880, was at one time much more important, its annual movement having sunk from about 1000 in 1866 to 388 small vessels in 1884. The population of the commune (10,012 in 1861) was 16,055 in 1881,—12,285 in the city proper, and 1717 in the suburbs Poggio and Verezzo.

San Remo, identified by Girolamo Rossi (Storia della Cittá) with a Greek Leucothea and a Roman Matistra, was Christianized by St Ormisdas and his pupil St Sirus. Rebuilt after the expulsion of the Saracens from Liguria, it took the name of San Romolo from its 6th-century bishop whose death-day, 13th October, is still a local fete. In what way Romulus was supplanted by Remus is not clearly ascertained. In 1544 the town was attacked by Barbarossa, and in 1625 by the French and Savoyards. The Genoese, against whose encroachments it had long defended its independence, subjugated it in 1753; and in 1797 it was incorporated in the district of Palms of the Ligurian republic.
