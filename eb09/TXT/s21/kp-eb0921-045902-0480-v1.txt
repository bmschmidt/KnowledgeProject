SCHUMACHER, Heinrich Christian (1780-1850), astronomer, born at Bramstedt in Holstein, 3d September 1780, was director of the Mannheim observatory from 1813 to 1815, and then became professor of astronomy in Copenhagen. From 1817 he directed the triangulation of Holstein, to which a few years later was added a complete geodetic survey of Denmark; the latter was left incomplete by Schumacher, but was finished after his death. For the sake of the survey an observatory was established at Altona (see Observatory) and Schumacher resided there permanently, chiefly occupied with the publication of Ephemerides (11 parts, 1822-32) and of the journal Astronomische Nachrichten, of which he lived to edit thirty-one volumes, and which still continues to be the principal astronomical journal. Schumacher died at Altona on 28th December 1850.
