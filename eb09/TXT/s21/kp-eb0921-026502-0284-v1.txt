SANGERHAUSEN, an ancient town of Prussian Saxony, is situated on the Gonna, near the south base of the Harz Mountains, and 30 miles to the west of Halle. In 1880 it contained 9136 inhabitants, chiefly occupied in the manufacture of beetroot sugar, machinery, buttons, &c., in agriculture, and in the coal and copper mines of the neighbourhood. Sangerhausen is one of the oldest towns in Thuringia, being mentioned in a document of the 10th century. The Romanesque church of St Ulrich is said to have been founded by Louis the “Springer,’ margrave of Thuringia, in 1079.[9:21:266]
