ST KILDA, a watering-place in Victoria, Australia, on the east shore of Hobson’s Bay, 3½ miles south of Melbourne, with w’hich it is connected by a railway. The borough had an area of 1886 acres and a population of 11,662 in 1881. The sea-beach is bordered by an esplanade; there is a large public park; and portions of the sea have been fenced-in to protect bathers from sharks. A town-hall, an assembly hall, a library, and the large Episcopal church of All Saints are among the public buildings.
