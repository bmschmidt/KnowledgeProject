SHENDY, a town on the right bank of the Nile, about 130 miles south of Berber and 100 north of Khartum, which, while its present population does not exceed 2500, was previous to its destruction by the Egyptians in 1822 a place of some 50,000 inhabitants and a station on the great caravan route between Senn√¢r and Egypt and Mecca. The terrible massacre perpetrated by the Egyptians was in revenge for the treacherous assassination by the native chiefs at Shendy of Ismail Pasha and his suite, who were first drugged and then burned to ashes with their huts. Shendy was the capital of a considerable district, and lies only 20 miles south of the ruins of Meroe.
