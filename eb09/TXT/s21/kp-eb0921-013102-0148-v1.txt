SACKING and SACK MANUFACTURE. Sacking is a stout close-woven fabric, properly of flax, but now very largely made of jute. The chief centres of the manufacture are Dundee and Forfar in Scotland. Sacks, however, are made of many qualities and from different fibres, according to the purposes to which they are devoted. A large proportion of flour sacks, those particularly of American origin, are made of stout cotton. Numerous attempts have been made to manufacture seamless sacks; but none have met with success. The invention of a sewing-machine for the “overhead” seaming of sacks has been successfully solved in the machine of Laing and other inventors.
