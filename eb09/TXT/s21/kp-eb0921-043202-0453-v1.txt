SCHÖNEBECK, a town of Prussian Saxony, on the left bank of the Elbe, 9 miles above Magdeburg. It contains manufactories of chemicals, machinery, percussion caps, starch, white lead, and various other articles, but is chiefly noted for its extensive salt springs and works, which produce about 70,000 tons of salt per annum. Large beds of rock-salt also occur in the neighbourhood, in which shafts have been sunk to a depth of more than 1200 feet. There is a harbour on the Elbe here, and a brisk trade is carried on in grain and timber. In 1885 Schönebeck contained 13,316 inhabitants (including the adjoining communities of Salze, Elmen, and Frohse, about 20,000).
