SAURIN, Jacques (1677-1730), one of the group of great French preachers of the 17th century (see France, vol. ix. p. 662), was born at Nîmes on January 6th 1677, studied at Geneva, settled in London in 1701 as one of the pastors of the Walloon church, and died at The Hague, on December 30, 1730, whither he had gone to defend himself before the synod against a trumped-up charge of heterodoxy. Besides collections of Sermons, on miscellaneous texts, he wrote Discours sur les événements les plus mémorables du Vieux et du Nouveau Testament (Amsterdam, 1720-28), a work which, as continued by Beausobre and Roques, became popular under the name of Sawiris Bible.
