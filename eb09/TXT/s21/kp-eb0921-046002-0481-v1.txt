SCHWALBACH, or Langenschwalbach, a favourite German health resort, in the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau, is pleasantly situated in the deep valley of the Münzenbach near its junction with the Aar, 12 miles northwest from Wiesbaden, with which it has regular communication by diligence. Besides a large kursaal, the town has four churches, a synagogue, a real school, and a higher school for girls. The three principal springs, which are largely impregnated in varying proportions with iron and carbonic acid (compare Mineral Waters), are connected by promenades. The permanent population of the town was 2811 in 1880, and the number of visitors reaches about 5000 annually.

About 4 ½ miles to the south of Schwalbach is Schlangenbad (360 inhabitants), the thermal springs of which are efficacious in nervous complaints and attract about 2000 visitors (chiefly ladies) every year The water is used externally only.
