ST MARTIN, one of the Lesser Antilles (West Indies), part of which (20 square miles) belongs to France and forms a dependency of Guadeloupe, while the remainder (18 square miles) belongs to Holland and along with Saba, &c., is a dependency of Curaçao. Situated in 18° N. lat. and 63° W. long., it ascends to a height of 1380 feet above the sea, and has a comparatively small cultivable area. The great saltpans of the Dutch portion produced in 1882 276,434 tons of salt, and there are similar saltpans in the French portion. Sugar and live-stock (horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs) are also exported. The chief settlement and anchorage in the French portion is Marigot, in the Dutch Philippsburg. The population in 1882 was 7083 (French portion 3724, Dutch 3359). Occupied by French freebooters in 1638 and by the Spaniards between 1640 and 1648, St Martin was divided between the French and Dutch in this latter year.
