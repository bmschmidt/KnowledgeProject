ST CHAMOND, a manufacturing town of France, in the department of Loire, 7½ miles east-north-east of St Etienne, at the confluence of the Janon with the Gier (an affluent of the Rhone), and on the railway from St Étienne to Lyons. Besides working a considerable number of coal-mines, St diamond employs twelve mills in the silk manufacture, and from 12,000 to 15,000 looms (mostly driven by hydraulic machinery) in lace-making, and has a variety of other manufactures. The population was 14,149 in 1881.

St diamond, founded in the 7th century by St Ennemond or diamond, archbishop of Lyons, became the chief town of the Jarret, a little principality formed by the valley of the Gier. Silk-milling was introduced in the town in the middle of the 16th century by Gayotti, a native of Bologna, and perfected towards the beginning of the 19th by Richard Chambovet. Remains are found at St diamond of a Roman aqueduct, which conveyed the waters of the Janon along the valley of the Gier to Lyons.
