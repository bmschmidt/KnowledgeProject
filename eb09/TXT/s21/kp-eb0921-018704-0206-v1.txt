ST NICOLAS, a town of Belgium, in the district of Dendermonde, in the province of East Flanders, 19Â½ miles from Ghent by the railway to Antwerp. It is a well-built, modern-looking place, with a very spacious market-place, famous as the spot where Philip the Fair swore in 1497 to maintain the privileges of Waesland, of which St Nicolas was the capital. From a comparatively small village, with only 5000 inhabitants in 1661, it has grown into a large manufacturing centre, with wool and cotton mills, needle-factories, &c., and a population (in 1876) of 24,729. The more conspicuous buildings are the town-hall and two of the churches.
