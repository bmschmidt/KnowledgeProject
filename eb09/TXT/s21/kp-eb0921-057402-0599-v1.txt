SCYMNUS of Chios, a Greek geographer of uncertain date, known to us only by a few references in later writers, but perhaps identical with the Scymnus Chius of a Delphic inscription of the beginning of the 2d century b.c. ,^[1. See Rhode, in Rhein. Mus., 1879, p. 153 sg.] was commonly taken to be the author of an imperfect anonymous Paraphrasis in verse describing the northern coast of the Mediterranean, which in the first edition (Augsburg, 1600) was ascribed to Marcianus of Heraclea. Meineke showed conclusively that this piece cannot be by Scymnus. It is dedicated to a King Nicomedes, probably Nicomedes III. of Bithynia, and so would date from the beginning of the 1st century b.c. See MÃ¼ller, Geog. Gr. Min., vol. i., where the poem is edited with sufficient prolegomena.
