SHIPLEY, a town of England, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, is situated on the south bank of the Aire, in the neighbourhood of a picturesque pastoral country, at the junction of the Leeds and Bradford Railway with the Bradford, Skipton, and Colne line, 3 miles north of Bradford. The church of St Paul, an elegant structure in the Gothic style erected in 1820, was altered and improved in 1876. The manufacture of worsted is the principal industry, and there are large stone quarries in the neighbourhood. A local board was established in 1853. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 1406 acres) in 1871 was 11,757 and in 1881 it was 15,093.
