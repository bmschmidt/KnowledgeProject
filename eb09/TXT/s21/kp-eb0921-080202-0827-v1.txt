SHERMAN, a city of the United States, in Grayson county, Texas, 73 miles north of Dallas, is a substantially built and flourishing place, with a court-house and a college. Its population, only 1439 in 1870, was 6093 in 1880 and has since increased to about 8000. The surrounding country is a cotton and grain district.
