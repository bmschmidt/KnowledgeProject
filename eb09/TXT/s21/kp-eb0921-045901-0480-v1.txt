SCHULTZE, Max Johann Siegmund (1825-1874), German microscopic anatomist, was born at Freiburg in Breisgau (Baden) on 25th March 1825. He studied at Greifswald and Berlin, and was appointed extraordinary professor at Halle in 1854 and five years later ordinary professor of anatomy and histology at Bonn. He died at Bonn 16th January 1874. His contributions to biology were numerous and varied. He founded and edited the important Archiv für mikroskopische Anatomie, to which he contributed many papers, and advanced the subject generally, by refining on its technical methods. He also contributed to the knowledge of the Protozoa (see Foraminifera, Protozoa). He will be longest remembered, however, by his reform of the cell theory. Uniting Dujardin’s conception of animal sarcode with Von Mohl’s of vegetable protoplasma, he pointed out clearly their identity, and included them under the common name of protoplasm. He thus reorganized the theory as established by Schwann, diminished the importance of the cell-wall and nucleus, and laid down the modern definition of the cell as “a nucleated mass of protoplasm with or without a cell-wall” (see Protoplasm and Schwann). An obituary notice of Schultze is given in Arch, mikr. Anat., 1875.
