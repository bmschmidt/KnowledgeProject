SCALA NOVA, Scala Nuova, or (Turkish) Kush-adassi, also known as New Ephesus, a harbour on the west coast of Asia Minor, in the vilayet of Aidin, opposite the island of Samos. Before the opening of the Smyrna-Aidin railway its excellent roadstead was largely frequented by vessels trading with the Anatolian coast, and it has often been proposed to connect it with this system by a branch line, and thus enable it to compete with Smyrna as a trading centre. The population is estimated at 7000 to 10,000, of whom about 3000 are Greeks.
