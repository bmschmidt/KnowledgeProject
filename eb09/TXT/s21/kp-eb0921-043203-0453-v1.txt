SCHÖNEBERG, a so-called Prussian “village,” in the province of Brandenburg, is now really a suburb of Berlin, which it adjoins on the south-west. It contains the royal botanic garden, a large maison de santé, and manufactories of paper collars, enamels, railway rolling-stock, and chemicals. The population in 1880 was 11,180. The foundation of Alt-Schöneberg is ascribed to Albert the Bear (12th century), while Neu-Schöneberg was founded by Frederick the Great in 1750 to accommodate some Bohemian weavers, exiled for their religion (cf. Rixdorf).
