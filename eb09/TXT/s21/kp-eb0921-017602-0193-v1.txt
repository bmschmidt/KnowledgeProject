ST JOSEPH, a city of the United States, capital of Buchanan county, Missouri, on the right bank of the Missouri, 260 miles west by north of St Louis. It is an important railway junction, possessing since 1873 a great road and railway bridge over the river constructed of iron, in the extent of its wholesale business it ranks as the third city in the State; and among its manufacturing establishments are flour-mills, starch-works, boot and shoe factories, pork-packing establishments, waggon-factories, a distillery, &c. Besides a city-hall and market-house, it contains a court-house (1875), an opera-house, a State lunatic asylum (1874), an agricultural and mechanical exposition association, a Roman Catholic cathedral, and five public libraries. The population was 8932 in 1860, 19,565

(1512 coloured) in 1870, and 32,431 (3227 coloured) in

1880.

Founded in 1843 by Joseph Robidoux, a French Roman Catholic, who had settled in the district some years previously as a trader, St Joseph in 1846 was made the county seat, and before 1857, when it received its first city charter, became well known as the great point of departure for emigrants bound for California and the West. During the Civil War, when it was fortified by the Federals, its natural development was considerably checked, but this revived as soon as the struggle was over.
