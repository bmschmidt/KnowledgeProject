SALE, an urban sanitary district of Cheshire, England, on the Bridgewater Canal and the Mersey, about 5 miles south of Manchester. At the beginning of the 19th century the greater part of the township was still waste and unenclosed. It owes its increase in population to the neighbourhood of Manchester and contains a number of handsome villas belonging to the wealthier classes. The Moorsland pleasure-grounds in the neighbourhood cover 10 1/2 acres. There are national and British schools and a literary institute. Market gardening is extensively carried on. The population of the urban sanitary district (area, 2006 acres) in 1871 was 5573, and in 1881 it was 7915.
