SATIN-WOOD, a beautiful light-coloured hard wood having a rich silky lustre, sometimes finely mottled or grained, the produce of a large tree, Chloroxylon Swietenia, native of India and Ceylon. A similar wood, known under the same name, is obtained in the West Indies, the tree yielding which is said to be Maba guianensis. Satinwood was in request for rich furniture about the end of the 18th century, the fashion then being to ornament panels of it with painted medallions and floral scrolls and borders. Now it is used for inlaying and small veneers, and most largely in covering the backs of hair and clothes-brushes and in making small articles of turnery.
