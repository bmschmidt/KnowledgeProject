SEPULCHRE, Canons Regular of the Holy, an order founded in 1114 by Arnold, patriarch of Jerusalem (or according to another account in 1099 by Godfrey of Bouillon), on the rule of St Augustine. It admitted women as well as men and soon spread rapidly over Europe. In the 17th century it received a new rule from Urban VIII. Shortly after this the canons became extinct; but the canonesses are still to be found in France, Baden, and the Netherlands. They live a strictly monastic life and devote themselves mainly to the work of education.
