SEYNE, La, a town of France, in the department of Var, 5 miles south-west of Toulon, with a population of 9788 in 1881. It owes its importance mainly to its shipbuilding, the Société des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée having here one of the finest building yards in

J Europe, in which more than 2000 workmen are employed; contracts are executed for private shipowners, for the great Messageries Maritimes Company, and for various Governments. The port, which has communication by steamer and omnibus with that of Toulon, is 6 acres in extent, and admits vessels of the largest tonnage.
