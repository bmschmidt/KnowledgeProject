SAPPAN WOOD is one of several red dyewoods of commerce, all belonging to the Leguminous genus Caesalpinia, or to the closely allied genus Peltopharum. It is a native of tropical Asia and the Indian Archipelago, but, as it is one of the most esteemed of the red dyewoods, its cultivation has been promoted in the West Indies and Brazil. The wood is somewhat lighter in colour than Brazil wood and its other allies, but the same tinctorial principle, brazilin, appears to be common to all. See Brazil Wood, vol. iv. p. 241.
