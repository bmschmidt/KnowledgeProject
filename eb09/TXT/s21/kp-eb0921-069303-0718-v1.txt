SESSA, a town of the kingdom of Italy, province of Terra di Lavoro, situated among hills on the site of the ancient Suessa Aurunca, on a small affluent of the Garigliano, is 17 miles east of Gaeta and half a mile from Sant’ Agata. The hill on which Sessa is situated is a mass of volcanic tufa, in which have been discovered painted chambers erroneously supposed to have belonged to a city covered by a volcanic eruption. The town contains many ancient remains, particularly the ruins of Ponte Aurunca and of an amphitheatre. It is the see of a bishop, has an interesting basilica with three naves, a gymnasium, a technical school, and a seminary. The cathedral contains inscriptions, a mosaic pavement, and a good ambo decorated with mosaics resting on columns. In the principal street are memorial stones with inscriptions in honour of Charles V., surmounted by an old crucifix with a mosaic cross. Exclusive of the environs, the town has a population of 6130. The hills of Sessa are celebrated for their vines, the “Ager Falernus” of the Romans.
