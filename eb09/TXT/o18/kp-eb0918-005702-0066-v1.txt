OSSETT-CUM-GAWTHORPE, a township and urban sanitary district in the West Riding of Yorkshire, including the contiguous hamlets of Ossett, South Ossett, and Gawthorpe, is situated about 3 miles west-north-west of Wakefield, and 1∣ north-west from the Horbury station on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. The Great Northern Railway has two stations in the township. The church of the Holy Trinity, a fine cruciform structure in the Early Decorated style, was erected in 1865 at a cost of £20,000. There are woollen cloth and mungo mills, and in the neighbourhood extensive collieries. The population of the township (3105 acres) in 1871 was 9190, and in 1881 it was 10,957.
