OTHO of Freising, German historian, was the son of Leopold IV., margrave of Austria, and of Agnes, the daughter of the emperor Henry IV. He became a priest, and was made provost of the monastery of Neuburg, which had been founded by his father. Soon afterwards he went to Paris to prosecute his studies; and on his way back he joined the Cistercian order in the monastery of Morimont, in Burgundy, of which he became abbot. In 1137 he was elected bishop of Freising, and this position he held until his death on September 22, 1158.

He was the author of two important works, a universal history, in which he brought the record down to 1146, and a history of the reign of the emperor Frederick I. The first of these works was continued (to 1209) by Otho of St Blasien, the second by Ragewin. Otho was not a very accurate historian, but he was much more than a mere chronicler, his materials being clearly and effectively arranged, and his narrative giving evidence of a penetrating and philosophical judgment. A critical edition of his writings was presented for the first time in the Monumenta Germanise, and this was afterwards separately published with the title, Ottonis Episcopi Frisingensis Opera, 1867.
