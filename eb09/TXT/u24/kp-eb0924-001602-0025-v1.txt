USHANT (Fr. Ouessant), the most westerly of the islands off the coast of France, 26 miles west-north-west from Brest, belongs administratively to the department of Finistère. It is about 4½ miles in length, and almost entirely granitic, with steep and rugged coasts, accessible only at a few points. The island affords pasturage to a few sheep and horses, and contains some small villages, the chief being St Michel. The inhabitants are principally pilots and fishermen. The total population in 1886 was 2307.
