UTRECHT, a province of Holland, bounded north by North Holland and the Zuyder Zee, east by Guelderland, south by Guelderland and South Holland, and west by South Holland, has an area of 534 square miles and a population (1886) of 212,454. It belongs chiefly to the basin of the Rhine: the Neder Rijn, which skirts its southern border, after sending off the Kromme Rijn at Wijk, becomes the Lek, and the Kromme Rijn, in its turn, after sending off the Vecht at Utrecht to the Zuyder Zee, assumes the name of the Oude Rijn. The northeastern portion of the province is drained by the Eem, which falls into the Zuyder Zee. In the west the province is flat and in many places below sea-level; towards the east, where the Veluwe begins, it is more undulating, and at Zeist reaches a height of 164 feet. The more productive region is in the west; towards the east the soil becomes sandy and heath-clad. Nearly half (46âˆ™5 per cent.) of the total area is under grass; the chief agricultural products are corn (buckwheat) and tobacco; bee-keeping is extensively carried on in the east, and there is a bee market at Veenendaal. The province is traversed by railways to Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Leyden, and The Hague, Bois-le-duc, Arnheim, Zutphen, and Zwolle, all converging in Utrecht; it is also amply provided with navigable water-ways. Of the total population 62 per cent. are returned as Protestant, 37 per cent. as Roman Catholic, and 1 as Jewish. Besides Utrecht (see below), the capital, only one other town, Amersfoort, has a population exceeding 5000 (15,178 in 1887); but in density of population Utrecht ranks third among the provinces of Holland.
