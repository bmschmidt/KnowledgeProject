LISTON, Robert (1794—1847), an eminent Scottish surgeon, was born on the 28th of October 1794, at Eccle-fechan, where his father was parish minister. He commenced the study of anatomy under Dr Barclay in Edinburgh University in 1810, and soon became a skilful anatomist. After eight years’ study, he began his career as a lecturer on anatomy and surgery in the Edinburgh School of Medicine; and in 1827 he was elected one of the surgeons to the Royal Infirmary. In 1835 he was invited to fill the chair of clinical surgery in University College, London. He held the appointment until his death, on the 7th of December 1847. Liston was a teacher more by what he did than by what he said. He taught simplicity in all operative procedures; fertile in expedients, of great nerve, and of powerful frame, his name is remembered at the present day as a bold and rapid operator. He inspired all around with confidence, and every one present at his operations felt that the knife in his hands, however rapidly he worked, was guided with skill founded upon knowledge. He was the author of The Elements of Surgery and Practical Surgery, and made several improvements in methods of amputation, and in the dressing of wounds.
