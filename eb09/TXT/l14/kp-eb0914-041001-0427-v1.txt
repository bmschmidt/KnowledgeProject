LEER, a seaport and the chief town of a circle in the province of Hanover, Prussia, lies on the right bank of the Leda near its confluence with the Ems, 16⅛ miles south of Aurich in 53° 13' N. lat., and 7° 27' E. long. The aspect of the town is generally pleasing, the streets being broad, well-paved, and adorned with many elegant buildings, among which are Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, and several public schools. The principal manufactories are for linen and woollen fabrics, hosiery, paper, cigars, soap, vinegar, and earthenware. There are, moreover, two iron-foundries, several distilleries, tanneries, and shipbuilding yards, besides many large warehouses. The transit trade from the regions traversed by the Westphalian and Oldenburg railways is considerable. The principal exports are cattle, horses, cheese, butter, honey, wax, flour, paper, hardware, and Westphalian coal. Vessels drawing 16 feet of water can approach the quays. The population in 1880 was 10,074.
