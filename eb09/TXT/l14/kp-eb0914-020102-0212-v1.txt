LAFAYETTE, the capital of Tippecanoe county, Indiana, U.S., is situated at the head of navigation on the Wabash river, and near the battle-ground of Tippecanoe, where, in 1811, General Harrison, afterwards president, defeated a large force of Indians. The city—which is much the largest of the twenty-four towns in the United States named in honour of General La Fayette—is beautifully situated in the centre of a rich agricultural region and amid an amphitheatre of hills, which are covered with suburban homes. La Fayette has eight lines of railway communication aud ten graded turnpikes extending in various directions. The La Fayette car-works employ eight hundred men. There are four national banks, three daily and nine weekly newspapers, five large boot and shoe manufactories, four breweries, one distillery, four large cooperage establishments, a paper mill, porkhouses for summer and winter curing, a horning mill, iron-works, together with numerous foundries and smaller manufacturing enterprises. The city is supplied with gas and waterworks, aud sulphur water, valuable for drinking and bathing purposes, flows from an artesian well in the public square. It is the seat of Purdue university, an agricultural college, richly endowed by a congressional land grant, and named in honour of John Purdue, who gave it $150,000. Population in 1880, 14,860.
