LASCAR, an Anglo-Persian term (from lashkar, an army), which formerly meant a non-combatant, or public follower of the ordnance department. Later on it came to mean any supernumeraries, and especially the native sailors engaged to supplement the crews of European vessels in the Eastern waters. The term is at present applied generally to the seafaring populations of the Indian seaboard manning British vessels sailing between England and the East. The Peninsular and Oriental and other large steamship companies now employ the lascars almost exclusively, preferring them to European crews on account of their greater docility, temperance, and obedience to orders. Nearly all are Mohammedans, and, besides their several native tongues, speak among themselves a sort of lingua franca based on Hindustani, with a considerable admixture of English, Arabic, and other elements. The word lascar is still applied somewhat in its former sense to tentpitchers, inferior artillerymen, coolies, or sutlers.
