LANGENSALZA, chief town of a circle in the government district of Erfurt, in the province of Saxony, Prussia, is situated on the Salza, about 20 miles north-east of Erfurt. It has an old castle, several schools of various grades, and three hospitals; and near it are the remains of the old monastery of Homburg. The manufacture of cloth is the chief industry, but lice, starch, and chemicals are also produced. The population of the town in 1875 numbered 9855. There is a sulphur bath iu the neighbourhood. Near Langensalza the Prussians and Hanoverians had a long and bloody engagement, June 27-29, 1866, which ultimately resulted in the capitulation of the latter.
