LANCASTER, Sir James, an eminent English seaman of the Elizabethan period. In his early years he was in Portugal as soldier and merchant; in 1591 he made a voyage on his own account to the East Indies; in 1594-95 he had command of an expedition which made an attack on Pernambuco; andin 1600 he was placed at the head of the first fleet sent out by the newly-founded East India Company. During his later years he acted as one of the directors of the company. He died in 1620.

The original journals of Lancaster’s principal voyage, during which he visited Java and Sumatra, have unfortunately been lost; and we only possess the narrative drawn up from them with questionable perspicacity by Purchas. The various portions of Hakluyt and Purchas relating to Lancaster have been edited for the Hakluyt Society by C. R. Markham (1879). The name of Lancaster Sound was bestowed by Baffin in honour of Sir James, on the strait trending westward from Baffin’s Bay.
