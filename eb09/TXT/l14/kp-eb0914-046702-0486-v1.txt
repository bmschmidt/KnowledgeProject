LEOPOLD I. (1790-1865), king of the Belgians, was the fourth son of Francis, duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and thus the uncle of Queen Victoria of England. His youth was chiefly spent in the Russian military service; he commanded a battalion at LÃ¼tzen, Bautzen, and Leipsic, entered Paris with the allied sovereigns, and accompanied them to England. In May 1816 he married the Princess Charlotte, only child of the Prince Regent (who died in the following year), having previously been created duke of Kendal in the English peerage. In 1830 he declined the crown of Greece, but was elected to the throne of Belgium in June 1831. For the subsequent events of his life see Belgium, vol. iii. p. 528 sq.
