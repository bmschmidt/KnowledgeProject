LA PORTE, chief city of La Porte county, Indiana, U.S., is situated at the intersection of three railways, 12 miles south of Lake Michigan, and about 60 miles southeast of Chicago. Surrounded by a fertile agricultural region, it carries on a considerable trade, and has manufactories of agricultural implements, foundries, and various mills. The vicinity has become a favourite summer residence, on account of its beautiful lakes, which in winter supply large quantities of clear ice for the Chicago and southern markets. The population in 1880 was 6195.
