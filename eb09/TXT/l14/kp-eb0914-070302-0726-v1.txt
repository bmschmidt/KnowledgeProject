LITTLE FALLS, a village and township in Herkimer county, New York, on the Erie canal, 73j miles westnorth-west of Albany by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, at a point where the Mohawk river passes by a series of rapids through a picturesque defile. The water-power is turned to account in the manufacture of paper, woollen and cotton goods, starch, &c. The village, which lies partly in the township of Manheim, had a population of 6910 in 1880. Little Falls has the largest cheese market in the United States.
