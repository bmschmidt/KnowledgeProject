LOGANSPORT, capital of Cass county, Indiana, U.S., is situated at the confluence of the Wabash and the Eel rivers, and on the Wabash and Erie canal, 75 miles north-west of Indianapolis. It is an important railway junction, and the trading-centre of an extensive agricultural districtâ€”dealing in grain, pork, and timber (poplar and black walnut). The Pittsburg, Cincinnati, and St Louis railroad maintains at this point large carriage-works, occupying 25 acres, and employing 600 men. The population was 11,198 in 1880.
