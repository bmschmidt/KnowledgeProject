LANCIANO, the chief town of a circle in the province of Chieti, Italy, is situated on three hills, about 5 miles from the Adriatic coast. It is one of the most beautiful cities in the Abruzzi Citeriore, and has broad regular streets, and several fine buildings. The cathedral, an imposing structure with a fine clock-tower, is built upon bridges that span the gorge of the Feltrino, and is dedicated to our Lady of the Bridge. The churches of Santa Lucia and Santa Maria Maggiore, built on the sites of heathen temples, and the theatre, also deserve notice. Although the industry and trade of the town have declined, a considerable miscellany of manufactures is still carried on. The textile industry, dealing with flax, hemp, silk, wool, and cotton, is the leading one; iron-working, rope-making, and the manufacture of wax, soap, cream of tartar, <fcc., follow. There are four yearly fairs. In 1872 the population was 8758; including the suburbs it was 15,342, or, embracing the commune, 17,340.

Lanciano claims a respectable antiquity, for, although Plinyâ€™s Anxia or Anxa Frentanorum is to be placed about a mile from the present town, there is no doubt that under the early empire the present site was occupied by a town, as the oldest of the bridges on which the cathedral stands was erected by the senate and people of Anxanum, under Diocletian. During the Middle Ages Lanciano was of considerable importance, and enjoyed various privileges, chiefly of a commercial nature.
