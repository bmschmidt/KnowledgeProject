LA DIXMERIE, Nicolas Bkicaire de (1730-1791), French man of letters, was a native of Champagne, and was born about 1730. While still young he removed to Paris, where the rest of his life was spent in considerable [9:14:199] literary activity. He died suddenly on November 26, 1791. His numerous works include Contes Philosophiques et Moraux characterized by Sabatier as “less agreeable than those of Marmontel, but more moral, more varied, and showing a keener sensibility ;” Les deux âges du G<rilt et du Genie sous Louis Z IV. et sous Louis XV. , a parallel and contrast, in which the decision is given in favour of the latter; H Espagne littéraire (1774); Éloge de Voltaire (1779) and Éloge de Montaigne (1781).
