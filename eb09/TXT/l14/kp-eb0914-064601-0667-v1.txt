LIMBURG, or Limbourg, one of the eleven provinces of Holland, is bounded on the W. by Belgium (Limburg) and North Brabant, on the N. by North Brabant and Guelderland, on the E. by Rhenish Prussia, and on the S. by Belgium (Liége), and has an area of 851 square miles, with a population in 1876 of 235,135 (97 per cent, being Roman Catholics). The surface, which is flat, is partly covered with heaths and fens; of the latter the most considerable is the “peel” or marsh in the north, which extends into North Brabant. The province is traversed by the Maas, of which the chief affluents here are the Geule, the Geleen, and the Roer, all on the right; means of water communication are also supplied by the Zuid Willem’s canal and its branches. The agricultural products are similar to those of Belgian Limburg; bee-keeping is also engaged in. Coal occurs within the province, and there is a mine at Kerkrade. The arrondissements are two in number,—Maestricht and Roermonde,—Maestricht being the capital. For the history of the province see the preceding article.
