LAMBALLE, Marie Thérèse Louise de Savoie-Carignan, Princesse de (1749-1792), daughter of Louis Victor of Carignan, was born at Turin, 8th September 1749. In 1767 she was married to Stanislaus, prince of Lamballe, and son of the duke of Penthièvre. After his death in [9:14:236] the following year an unsuccessful attempt was made to arrange a marriage between her and Louis XV. She then retired from the court; but, having accidentally made the acquaintance of Marie-Antoinette, she was after the accession of Louis XVI. appointed by the queen superintendent of the royal household, and enjoyed her closest intimacy and friendship. In 1792 she shared for a week her imprisonment in the Temple, but on the 19th August she was transferred to La Force, and, having refused the oath against the monarchy, she was on September 3d delivered over to the fury of the populace, after which her head was placed on a pike and carried before the windows of the imprisoned queen.
