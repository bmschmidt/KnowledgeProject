LEBEDIN, a district town of the Kharkoff government in European Russia, 102 miles north-west of the government town, near the Olshana and Buravka, two small tributaries of the Dnieper. Its population has increased from 15,137 in 1863 to 17,019 in 1879. There arc four annual fairs, and a good trade in grain and cattle.

Lebedin dates from the middle of the 17th century. In 1709 it was the headquarters of the operations of Peter the Great against Mazeppa, and the scene of the execution of nine hundred of that hetmanâ€™s followers, whose common grave is still marked by a mound 70 feet square.
