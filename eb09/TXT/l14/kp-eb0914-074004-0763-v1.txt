LLANGOLLEN, a picturesque market-town of Denbighshire, North Wales, and a favourite summer resort, is beautifully situated in a fine vale surrounded by lofty mountains, on the right bank of the Dee, and on a branch line of the Great Western Railway, 9 miles south-west of Wrexham, and 22 south-west of Chester. The river is crossed by a peculiarly constructed bridge of five arches built in 1345. The church, dedicated to St Collen, is a plain but ancient structure, partly in the Early English style. Opposite the town, on the summit of a conical hill.

are the remains of a very ancient fortress, the Castell Dinas Bran. The beautiful abbey of Valle Crucis, in a neighbouring dell, is one of the finest ecclesiastical ruins in Wales. Near it there is an ancient British monument, the “Pillar of Eliseg.” The principal secular buildings of the town are the town-hall and the court-house. The industries include the manufacture of linen and wool, and in the vicinity there are collieries, lime-works, and ironworks. The population of the urban sanitary district in 1871 was 2798, and in 1881 it was 3124.
