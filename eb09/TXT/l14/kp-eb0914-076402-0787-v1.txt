LOCLE, Le, a large town-like village of Switzerland, in the canton of Neuchâtel, 10 miles W.N.W. from Neuchâtel. Along with La Chaux de Fonds, 5 miles north-east, it is the seat of the most extensive watch-making industry in the world; and it also carries on the domestic manufacture of lace. The valley in which Le Locle is situated used to be subject to inundation, but in 1802-6 a tunnel was constructed by which the surplus waters of the Bied discharge into the Doubs. About a mile to the west of the town the stream plunges into a deep chasm, and on the almost vertical face of the rock are what are usually called the subterranean mills of Cui des Roches, situated one above the other, to turn the water-power to account. The population of the commune was 10,464 in 1880.
