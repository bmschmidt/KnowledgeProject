LA FARINA, Giuseppe (1815-1863), Italian author and politician, was born at Messina in 1815. On account of the part taken by him in the insurrection of 1837 he found it necessary to quit Sicily, but returning in 1839 he conducted various newspapers of liberal tendencies, until his efforts were completely interdicted, when he removed to Florence. In 1840 he had published Messina ed i suoi Monumenti, and after his removal to Florence he brought out La Germania coi suoi Monumenti, 1842; HItalia coi suoi Monumenti, 1842; La Svizzera Stomca ed Artisticα, 1842-43; La China, 4 vols., 1843-47; and Storia d’Italia, 7 vols., 1846-5 4. He also in 1847 established a democratic journal HAlba in the interests of Italian freedom and unity, but on the outbreak of the revolution in Sicily in 1848 he returned thither and was elected one of the committee of war. In the following year he was chosen to represent Messina in parliament, where he moved the deposition of King Ferdinand and the adoption of a new constitution. In April 1849 the provisional government, in which La Farina was minister successively of public instruction, of public works, and of the interior, resolved, notwithstanding his strong advocacy of resistance, to submit, to the royal authority, and he removed to France. In 1850 he published Istoria della Rivoluzione Siciliana, and in 1851-52, in 6 vols., Storia dj Italia dal 1815 al 1850. He also began in 1851 Rivista Enciclo-pedica Italiana, and in 1856 Piccolo Carrière TItalia, an organ which had great influence in propagating the political sentiments of the Societa Nazionale Italiana, of which he ultimately was chosen president. During the remainder of his life he was a devoted supporter of Victor Emmanuel, and in 1860 he was chosen a member of the first Italian parliament. He died 5th September 1863.
