LAI-YANG, a city in the Chinese province of Shan-tung, situated in 37° N. lat. and 120° 55' E. long., about the middle of the eastern peninsula, on the highway running south from Che-foo to Kin-Kea or Teng-tsi harbour. It is surrounded by well-kept walls of great antiquity, and its main streets are spanned by large pailows or monumental arches, some of which date from the time of the emperor Tai-ting-te of the Yuen dynasty (1324). There are extensive suburbs both in the north and south, and the total population is estimated at 50,000. The so-called Ailanthus silk produced by Saturnia cynthia is woven at Lai-yang into a strong fabric; and the manufacture of the peculiar kind of wax obtained from the la-shoo or wax tree insect is largely carried on in the vicinity.
