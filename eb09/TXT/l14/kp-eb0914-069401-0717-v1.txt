LISKEARD, anciently Liscarret, a market-town and municipal and parliamentary borough in the county of Cornwall, England, is picturesquely situated, partly in a hollow and partly on a rocky eminence, 12 miles east of Bodmin, and 265 west-south-west of London by rail. The church of St Martin, in the Perpendicular style, with a tower of earlier date which possesses a Norman arch, is the largest ecclesiastical building in the county, except the church of Bodmin. A town-hall in the Italian style was erected in 1859. A grammar school was founded at a very early period, and there are several other schools and charities. There are manufactures of leather, but the prosperity of the town is dependent chiefly on agriculture, and the neighbouring tin, lead, and copper mines. Liskeard returns one member to parliament. It received its first charter in 1240, from Richard, earl of Cornwall, brother of Henry III., but its principal charter in 1586, from Queen Elizabeth. The population of the municipal borough (area 810 acres) in 1871 was 4700, and in 1881 it was 4479, that of the parliamentary borough (area 8387 acres) in the same years being 6576 and 5591.
