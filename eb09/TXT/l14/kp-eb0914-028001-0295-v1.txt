LANDSBERG-AN-DER-WARTHE, chief town of a circle in the government district of Frankfort, in the province of Brandenburg, Prussia, is situated at the confluence of the Warthe and Kladow, 80 miles north-east of Berlin by rail. It has a gymnasium of the first class, a hospital, and a poorhouse, besides the other ordinary educational, charitable, and administrative provisions. The productive industry of Landsberg centres in the engine and boiler works and iron-foundries; but the other manufactures include a considerable miscellany, whose chief items are tobacco, cloth, carriages, wools, and spirits. An active trade is carried on in the manufactures of the town, and in the produce of the surrounding country. Landsberg dates its origin from about the middle of the 13th century. In 1875 its population was 21,379.
