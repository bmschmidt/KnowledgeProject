LAMPSACUS, an ancient Greek colony in Mysia, Asia Minor, known as Pityusa or Pityussa before its colonization by Ionian Greeks from Phocaea and Miletus, was situated on the Hellespont, opposite Callipolis in Thrace. It possessed a good harbour; and the neighbourhood was famous for its wine, so that, having fallen into the hands of the Persians during the Ionian revolt, it was assigned by their king to Themistocles to provide him with wine, as Percote did with meat, and Magnesia with bread. After the battle of Mycale (479 B.c.), Lampsacus joined the Athenians, but, having revolted from them soon afterwards, [9:14:250] had to be reduced by force. In the Roman wars against Antiochus of Syria, its inhabitants were received as allies of Rome. Lampsacus was the chief seat of the worship of Priapus; and it is related that Alexander the Great was with difficulty restrained from destroying the city on account of the immorality fostered by the obscene rites of that god. The modern Lamsaki is probably not on the site of Lampsacus, but must be near it.
