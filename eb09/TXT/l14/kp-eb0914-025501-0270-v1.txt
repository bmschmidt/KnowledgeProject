LANCASTER, the shire city of Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, U.S., is situated on the Conestoga river, 68 miles west of Philadelphia by rail. It was founded in 1730 and incorporated as a borough in 1742, was the State capital from 1799 to 1812, and in 1812 became a city. It is laid out on the rectangular plan, and is unusually well built. The city is the seat of numerous charitable and educational institutions. Among the latter is Franklin and Marshall College, the chief educational establishment of the Reformed Church, which also maintains a theological seminary in connexion with it. The court-house is an imposing edifice, erected in 1853 at a cost of $166,000. The county jail is a massive sandstone structure, with a tower 110 feet high, built at a cost of $110,000 in 1851. Lancaster is the centre of one of the wealthiest agricultural regions in the United States. Its cotton, iron, and other mills are numerous and large, and it contains one of the most extensive watch factories in the country. Its tobacco trade requires nearly 100 large warehouses for its accommodation. A valuable trade in coal, lumber, leather, and grain is also carried on. James Buchanan, the fifteenth president of the United States, lived in Lancaster, and is buried there. The population in 1880 numbered 25,846.
