LACONDAMINE, Charles Marie de (1701-1774), French geographer and mathematician, born at Paris, January 28, 1701, was trained for the military profession, but turned his attention to science and geographical exploration. He was a member with Godin and Bυuguer of the expedition sent to Peru in 1735 to determine the length of a degree of the meridian in the neighbourhood of the equator (see vol. vii. 598), and on his homeward route made the first scientific exploration of the river Amazon. He returned to Paris in 1745, and published the results of his measurements and travels with a map of the Amazon in Mem. de V Académie des Sciences, 1745 (English translation 1745-47). La Condamiue continued to interest himself in metrical problems, and on a visit to Rome made careful measurements of the ancient buildings with a view to a precise determination of the length of the Roman foot. The journal of his voyage to the equator was published at Paris in 1751. He also wrote in favour of inoculation. He died February 4, 1774.
