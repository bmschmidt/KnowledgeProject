LIPETSK, a district town of Russia, in the government of Tamboff, 95 miles west of the chief town of the government, and 23 miles north-west of Gryazi railway junction, at the confluence of Lyesnoy Voronesh and Lipovka rivers. The town is built of wood, and the streets are unpaved, but it is a commercial centre of some importance. There are several beetroot-sugar and leather works, tallow-melting houses, and distilleries. There is a brisk business at the weekly fairs, and the merchants carry on active trade in horses, cattle, tallow, skins, and honey, sent by rail to the northern provinces, and in timber, shipped down to the province of the Don Cossacks. The Lipetsk mineral springs came into repute in the time of Peter I., who caused them to be surrounded by galleries, and laid down three gardens; they continue to attract visitors during the summer. Lipetsk received municipal institutions in 1779. Population 14,500.
