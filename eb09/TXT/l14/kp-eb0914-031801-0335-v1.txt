LA SALLE, chief city of La Salle county, Illinois, U.S., is situated on the right bank of the Illinois river, navigable up to this point, about 80 miles south-west of Chicago, with which it is connected by the Illinois and Michigan Canal as well as by rail. La Salle is a rising commercial city, with manufactories of glass, sulphuric acid, and sodaash, and some export of ice, as well as extensive zinc rolling millsâ€”the only works of the kind in the United States. The supply of bituminous coal in the vicinity is large, the output of the mines being 1,000,000 tons annually. The population in 1880 was 7847.
