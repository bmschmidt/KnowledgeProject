LLANDUDNO, a watering-place in Carnarvonshire, North Wales, situated on the Irish Sea, and at the mouth of the Conway, in a finely sheltered bay, 50 miles west of Chester by rail. It lies between Great Orme’s Head and Little Orme’s Head, two lofty promontories which rise precipitously from the sea to the height of several hundred feet. Round Great Orme’s Head a public drive has been made, from which very picturesque views are obtained. The rock is greatly frequented by many varieties of sea birds, and is also the habitat of many rare plants. The old parish church of St Tudno, situated on a cliff overlooking the sea, has been replaced by a later structure (St George’s), and the Church of Holy Trinity in the First Pointed style was erected in 1865. The chief attractions of the town are its picturesque and sheltered situation, and the fine facilities it affords for sea bathing. In the neighbouring copper-mines various mineralogical specimens of interest have been found. On the summit of the head there are the remains of old circular buildings, some portions of an old fortress, and a rocking stone. The population of the urban sanitary district in 1871 was 2762, and in 1881 it was 4838, but these figures do not represent its summer population, which is nearly twice as great.
