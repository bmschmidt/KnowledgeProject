LINCOLN, a city of the United States, county seat^of Lancaster county, Nebraska, and capital of the State. It is pleasantly situated about 50 miles west of the "Missouri river, at the junction of several railroads, in the midst of a highly fertile and healthful region of undulating prairie, and near rich salt springs. Lincoln is the seat of the following State institutions :â€”university, State prison, insane asylum, and home for the friendless. The prison and the asylum grounds, occupying several hundred acres, are 3 miles from the centre of the city, and 2 miles from each other. The United States Government has lately completed, at a cost of $200,000, a massive building for collection of revenue, United States courts, and postoffice. With its broad streets, its public park, and the State House and other grounds, the healthful ventilation of Lincoln is amply provided for. It has three daily papers, four banks, one of the largest printing and publishing houses west of the Mississippi, and several prosperous wholesale stores. Although but thirteen years old, it has a population (1880) of 13,003.
