LEIGH, a market and manufacturing town of Lancashire, England, is situated on several branch railway lines, 7∣ miles south-west of Bolton. The ancient parish church was, with the exception of the old tower, rebuilt in 1873 in the Perpendicular style, at a cost of over £10,000. The grammar school, the date of whose foundation is unknown, received its principal endowments in 1655, 1662, and 1681. A union workhouse was erected in 1851 at a cost of £10,000. The staple manufactures of the town are silk and cotton, but there are also glass-works, foundries, breweries, and flour-mills, with extensive collieries. The local government board was formed in 1875 by the amalgamation of those previously existing for the townships of West Leigh, Bedford, and Pennington. The population of the district was 17,623 in 1871, and 21,733 in 1881. The town includes also a portion of the township of Atherton.
