LENNEP, a small town of Rhenish Prussia in. the district of DÃ¼sseldorf, is situated 18 miles east of Diisseldorf and 9 miles south of Barmen, at a height of 1050 feet above the level of the sea. It lies in the heart of one of the busiest industrial districts in Germany, and carries on important manufactures of the finer kinds of cloth, wool, yarn, felt, and other articles. It is the seat of a small chamber of commerce, and possesses a large and well-equipped hospital. Lennep, which was the residence of the counts of Berg from 1226 to 1300, owes the foundation of its prosperity to an influx of Cologne weavers during the 14th century. Population (1880) 8077, about onefourth of whom are Roman Catholics.
