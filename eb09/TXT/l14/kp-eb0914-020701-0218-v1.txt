LAFOSSE, Charles de, (1640-1716), French painter, was one of the most noted and least servile pupils of Lebrun, under whose direction he shared in the chief of the great decorative works undertaken in the reign of Louis XIV. He was born at Paris in 1640, and left France for Italy in 1G62. He then spent two years in Rome and three in Venice, and the influence of his prolonged studies of Veronese is evident in his Finding of Moses (Louvre), and in his Rape of Proserpine (Louvre), which he presented to the Academy as his diploma picture in 1673. He was at once named assistant professor, and in 1674 the full responsibilities of the office devolved on him, but his engagements did not prevent his accepting in 1689 the invitation of Lord Montagu to decorate Montagu House, He visited London twice, remaining on the second occasion—together with Rousseau and Monnoyer—more than two years. William III. vainly strove to detain him in England by the proposal that he should decorate Hampton Court, for Lebrun was dead, and Mansart pressed Lafosse to return to Paris to take in hand the cupola of the Invalides. The decorations of Montagu House are destroyed, those of Versailles are restored, and the dome of the Invalides (engraved, Picart and Cochin)—for to his vexation the rest of the surface fell into other hands—is now the only work existing which •gives a full measure of his talent. During his latter years Lafosse executed many other important decorations in public buildings and private houses, notably in that of Crozat, under whose roof he died on 13th December 1716.
