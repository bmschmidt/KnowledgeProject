LIVINGSTON, Robert R. (1746-1813), American statesman, brother of Edward Livingston noticed above, was born at New York, November 27, 1746. He graduated at King’s College, New York, at the age of nineteen, became a practitioner of law, and, in 1773, recorder of the city, but was soon displaced by loyalist influence because of his sympathies with the revolution. In 1776 he was a member of the committee of congress which drew up the Declaration of Independence, and in 1777 was a prominent member of the convention at Kingston, which framed the first constitution of New York. Upon the adoption of that instrument in the same year he became the first chancellor of the Stιte, which office he held until 1801, whence he is best known as “Chancellor” Livingston. He administered the oath of office to Washington at his first inauguration to the presidency in New York, April 30, 1789. In 1801 he was appointed by President Jackson as minister to France, and in 1803 effected in behalf of his Government the purchase from France of the vast territory then known as Louisiana, comprising the entire territory between the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains, from the Spanish to the British possessions. This was, perhaps, the most important transfer of territory by purchase ever made, but none of those who participated in it realized its importance. Napoleon’s agent obtained ten million francs more than he had been instructed to accept for the cession, and Jefferson and Livingston were at the time bitterly censured for rashly concluding so useless a purchase. In 1804 Livingston withdrew from public life, and after spending a year in travel in Europe, returned to New York, where ho occupied his remaining years in promoting various improvements in agriculture. He also assisted Fulton in his invention of the steamboat. He died in February 1813.
