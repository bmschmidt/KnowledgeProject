LABIENUS, Titus, Julius Caesar’s propraetor in Gaul, first attracted his leader’s favour in a civil capacity. In 63 B.c. he appeared at Caesar’s instigation as the prosecutor of Rabirius for perduellio; and in the same year, being tribune of the plebs, he carried a plebiscitum that indirectly secured for Caesar the dignity of pontifex maximus. The military talent of Labienus was respectable, though not brilliant; but of all the officers trained under Caesar in his Gallic campaigns he was the most trusted. His chief exploits in Gaul were the defeat of the Treviri under Indutiomarus in 54 B.c., his expedition against Lutetia (Paris) in 52 b.c., and his victory over Camologenus and the Aedui in the same year. In 50 b.c. he was left in command of Gallia Cisalpina, while Caesar returned to the north; but, on the outbreak next year of the civil war between Caesar and Pompey, Labienus was one of the first to desert Caesar. His motive is perhaps to be looked for, not so much iu a deliberate calculation of chances, as in an overweening sense of his own importance, not adequately recognized by Caesar. He was rapturously welcomed on the Pompeian side; but he brought no great strength with him. The veterans remained true to Caesar, and even the town of Cingulum, on which Labienus had lavished much of his wealth, opened its gates to the future dictator. The ill fortune of Labienus under Pompey was as marked as his success had been under Caesar’s auspices. From the defeat at Pharsalia to which he had contributed by affecting to despise his late comrades, he fled to Africa. There, indeed, he was able by mere force of numbers to inflict a slight check upon Caesar at Ruspina in 45 B.c.; but when the defeat at Thapsus ruined the Pompeian party in Africa, Labienus withdrew to join the younger Pompey in Spain. At Munda, on March 17, 45 b.c., he again met Caesar, and in the ensuing defeat of his party fell sword in hand.
