YEISK, a district town of the Russian province of Kuban (Caucasus), was founded in 1848 at the mouth of the Yeia, on a narrow sandbank which separates the shallow Bay of Yeisk from the Sea of Azoff, 108 miles to the south-west of Rostoff-on-the-Don. Notwithstanding its shallow roadstead, which has a depth of 14 feet only at 2 miles from the shore, Yeisk has grown with great rapidity, and in 1884 had 23,725 inhabitants. Corn, linseed, and wool are exported to a considerable extent (1,730,000 cwts. of corn and flax and 10,000 cwts. of wool in 1885), and the port was visited in 1886 by 69 ships (30,000 tons) engaged in foreign trade and by 697 (80,800 tons) engaged in the coasting trade. There are large woolcleansing factories, oil-works, and tanneries.
