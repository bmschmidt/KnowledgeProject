YOH-CHOW FU, a prefectural city in the Chinese province of Hoo-nan (“south of the lakes ”), stands on high ground on the east side of the outlet of Tung-ting Lake, in 29° 18' N. lat. and 113° 2' E. long. The district in which Yoh-chow Fu stands is the ancient habitat of the aboriginal San Miao tribes, who were subsequently deported into north-western China, and who, judging from some of the non-Chinese festival customs of the people, would appear to have left traditions behind them. The present city, which was built in 1371, is about 3 miles in circumference and is entered by four gates. The walls are high and well built, but were not strong enough to keep out the Taiping rebels in 1853. Situated between Tung-ting Lake and the Yang-tze-kiang, Yoh-chow Fu forms a depot for the native products of the province which are destined for export, and for foreign goods on their way inland. In 1885 foreign goods to the value of 28,228 taels were sent from Hankow to Yoh-chow Fu, the principal items being grey shirting, oil, and lead. The city is 4250 Chinese miles from Peking, and contains a population of about 60,000.
