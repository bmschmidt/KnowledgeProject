YOUNGSTOWN, a city and the county seat of Mahoning county, Ohio, United States, is situated upon the Mahoning river, a tributary of the Ohio. The prevailing industries of the surrounding country are agriculture and coal-mining. Youngstown is directly connected with six railway lines. Owing to the contour of the site, the city is laid out very irregularly. The population in 1880 was 15,435 (8075 in 1870). The industries of Youngstown are connected chiefly with the manufacture of iron: there are several furnaces and rolling-mills, and manufactories of rails and stoves and of agricultural tools and machines.

Youngstown was laid out in 1797, being one of the first settlements made in that part of Ohio known as the Western Reserve. Since the rebellion it has grown with great rapidity.
