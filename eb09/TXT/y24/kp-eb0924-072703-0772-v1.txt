YAMBO, or Yembo, more properly Yanbo', a town of Arabia on the Red Sea, in 24° 4' N. lat. Having the best harbour on this coast, it has taken the place of Al-Jâr (which lay to the south and is now ruined) as the port of Medina, and is visited by steamships in connexion with the pilgrim traffic and for the import of grain. The town is surrounded by dilapidated walls, and the fixed population probably does not exceed 4000 (Von Maltzan). The Johaina Arabs are the dominant element, though there is a Turkish officer and guard who maintain a certain authority within the walls. Six or seven hours’ journey inland at the base of the mountains (Jebel Radwâ) is the fruitful valley of Yanbo' al-Nakhl, with palm-groves, several hamlets of the Johaina, and country houses of the merchants of the port. This inland town, or group of villages, is the Yanbo' of the old Arab geographers, and lies on the route of the Egyptian pilgrim caravan, one night’s journey from the famous battlefield of Bedr. The port is sometimes distinguished as Yanbo' al-Bahr (Yanbo' on the Sea).
