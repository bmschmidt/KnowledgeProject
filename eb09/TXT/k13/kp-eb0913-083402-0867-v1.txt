KAMUISHIN, or Kamyshin, a town of Russia, in the Saratoff government, on the right bank of the Volga, 120 miles south-south-west of Saratoff", on the highway to Astrakhan. The inhabitants carry on a good river-trade in wood, tar, grain, fish, tallow, and garden produce,â€”the Kamuishin melons especially being sent to various parts of Russia, and forming the raw material for a kind of syrup (nardelc) manufactured in the town. The population in 1861 was 8644; the St Petersburg calendar for 1873 gives the number as 15,698.

Kamuishin, it is said, was founded in 1668 on the left bank of the Kamuishinka, for the suppression of the brigandage carried on in the district. Peter I., intending to make a canal from the stream to the Ilovyla, erected a fort on its right bank; and in 1710 the inhabitants of the older settlement removed to the same side, and the town took the name of Dmitrievsk. The present name dates from 1780, when the place became the chief town of a district.
