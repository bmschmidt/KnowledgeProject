KÁLPI, or Culpee, a town in Jalâun district, NorthWestern Provinces, India, situated on the right bank of the Jumna, 26° 7' 30" N. lat., 79° 47' 15" E. long. Population (1872), 15,570, viz., 11,414 Hindus and 4156 Mahometans. It was founded, according to tradition, by Bâsdeo or Vasudeva, who ruled at Kâmbai from 330 to 400 A.D. In 1196 it fell to Kutb-ud-din, the viceroy of Muhammad Ghori, and during the subsequent Mahometan period it played a large part in the annals of this part of India. About the middle of the last century it fell into the hands of the Marhattâs. It was captured by the British in the campaign of 1803, and since 1806 has remained in British* possession. In May 1858 Sir Hugh Rose (Lord Strathnairn) defeated there a large force of about 10,000 rebels under the râni of Jhânsï. Kâlpi was formerly a place of far greater importance than at present. It had a mint for copper coinage in the reign of Akbar; and the East India Company made it one of their principal stations for providing the “commercial investment.” A bridge of boats on the Jhânsi and Cawnpur road crosses the river during the summer months. Cotton and grain are exported to Cawnpur, Mirzâpur, and Calcutta; and paper and sugar candy are manufactured.
