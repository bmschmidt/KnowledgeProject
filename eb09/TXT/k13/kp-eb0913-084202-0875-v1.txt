KANKAKEE, the chief city and county seat of Kankakee county, Illinois, U.S., is situated on the north bank of the Kankakee river, 56 miles south of Chicago. It is the centre of a very rich and fertile farming district, and has a large trade in agricultural produce. It has fine water-power, and, being within easy reach of extensive coal-fields and deposits of bog-iron ore, does a large manufacturing business. The population of the city and township in 1880 was 5652.
