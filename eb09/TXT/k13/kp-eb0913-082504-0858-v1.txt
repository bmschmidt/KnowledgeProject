KAITHAL, or Kythal, an ancient town in Karnàl district, Punjab, India, 29° 48' 7" N. lat., 76° 26' 26" E. long. It is said to have been founded by the mythical hero Tudishthira, and is connected by tradition with the monkey-god Hanûmân. In 1767 it fell into the hands of the Sikh chieftain, Bhai Desu Sinh, whose descendants, the Bhais to Kaithal, ranked among the most important and powerful Cis-Sutlej chiefs. Their territories lapsed to the British in 1843. There is some trade in grain, salammoniac, live stock, and blankets; and saltpetre and lac ornaments and toys are manufactured. Population in 1868, 14,490.
