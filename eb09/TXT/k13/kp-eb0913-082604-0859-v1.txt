KALBE, or Calbe, an der Saale, chief town of a circle in the government district of Magdeburg, Prussia, is situated on the Saale, 3 miles from the Saale (Grizehne) station on the Leipsic and Magdeburg Railway. It contains a local court, a middle school, and several benevolent institutions. The industries of the place include woolspinning, and the manufacture of cloth, oil, paper, bricks, beet-root sugar, and tobacco. Cucumbers and onions are largely cultivated in the neighbourhood; and anthracite is excavated. In 1875 the population was 7982; with the adjacent Bernburger and Schlossvorstadt it was 11,115.
