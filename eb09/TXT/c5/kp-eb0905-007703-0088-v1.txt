CAPPERONIER, Claude (1671-1744), a classical scholar, was the son of a tanner at Montdidier. He studied at Amiens and Paris, and took orders in the Church of Rome, but devoted himself almost entirely to classical studies. He declined a professorship in the university of Basel, and was afterwards appointed to the Greek chair in the Coll√®ge de France. He published an edition of Quintilian, and left behind him at his death an edition of the ancient Latin Rhetoricians, which was published in 1756. His nephew, Jean Capperonier, was also a famous linguist.
