CHAPPE, Claude (1763-1805), a French engineer, and the inventor of the simple French telegraph, was born in Normandy in 1763. His invention consisted of an upright post, on the top of which was fastened a transverse bar, while at the ends of the latter two smaller arms moved on pivots. The positions of these four bars represented words or letters; and by means of machines placed at intervals such that each was distinctly visible from the next, messages could be conveyed through 50 leagues in a quarter of an hour. It was said that Chappe borrowed the design from Hooke and Amontons, and the charge so deeply affected him that, notwithstanding the success of his machine, which had been adopted by the Legislative Assembly in 1792, he was seized with deep melancholia, under which he committed suicide in 1805.
