CERIGO.TTO, an island of Greece, belonging to the Ionian group, and situated between Cerigo and Crete in 35° 50' N. lat. and 23° 20' E. long. It was anciently known as Aegilia, and is now called by its inhabitants Lius. With an area of about 10 square miles it supports a population of about 300, who are mainly Cretan refugees, and in favourable seasons exports a quantity of good wheat. It was long a favourite resort of Greek pirates.
