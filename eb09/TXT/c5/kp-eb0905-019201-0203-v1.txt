CASTEL, Louis Bertrand (1688-1757), a learned mathematician, was born at Montpellier in 1G88, and entered the order of the Jesuits in 1703. At first he was a student of literature, but he afterwards devoted himself entirely to mathematics and natural philosophy. He [9:5:193] wrote several scientific works, that which attracted most attention at the time being his Optique des Couleurs, or treatise on the melody of colours. He endeavoured to illustrate the subject by a clavecin oculaire, or ocular harpsichord; but the treatise and the illustration were quickly forgotten. He also published a critical account of the system of Sir Isaac Newton in French.
