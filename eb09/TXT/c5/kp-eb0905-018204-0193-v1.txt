CASSANDRA, in Grecian story, daughter of Priam and Hecuba, was beloved of Apollo, who promised to bestow on her the spirit of prophecy if she would comply with his desires. Cassandra accepted the proposal; but no sooner had she obtained the gift than she laughed at the tempter, and refused to fulfil her promise. Apollo revenged himself by ordaining that her predictions should be discredited; and hence it was in vain that she prophesied the ruin of Troy. On the capture of that city she was ravished by Ajax, the son of OÃ¯leus, in the Temple of Minerva. In the distribution of the booty, Cassandra fell to the lot of Agamemnon, who loved her deeply; but again her foresight was useless, for he would not believe her prediction that he should perish in his own country. The prophecy was fulfilled, for both were slain through the intrigues of Clytemnestra.
