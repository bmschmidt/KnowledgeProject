CINEAS, a Thessalian, the chief adviser of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. The most famous event of his life was the visit which he made to Rome for the purpose of concluding the war, after the defeat of the Romans by Pyrrhus at Heraclea (280 B.c.) He performed the feat of learning in one day the name of every man of importance in the city, and displayed besides the most marvellous tact and eloquence; but the effects of his persuasion being destroyed through the patriotic vehemence of the venerable Appius Claudius Caecus, he returned to his master with the report that Rome was a temple, and its senate an assembly of kings. Cineas also served as an ambassador in Sicily. He is perhaps the Cineas referred to by Cicero as the author of a work De Re Militari.
