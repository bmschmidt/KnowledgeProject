CANTON, a city of the United States, in Stark county, Ohio, about 118 miles north-east of Columbus, on the Nimishillen Creek. It forms the centre of a large agricultural district, and carries on a thriving trade. Coal and limestone are abundant in the neighbourhood, and the creek affords a good supply of water-power. There are several iron foundries and woollen factories in the town, as well as establishments for the manufacture of reaping-machines. Besides daily papers, two monthly periodicals are published. Population in 1870, 8660.
