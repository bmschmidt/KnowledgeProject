CICACOLE, a town of British India, in the presidency of Madras and district of Ganjam, about 58 miles N.E. of the town of Vizagapatam, on the left bank of the River Nagawalli or Naglandi, a few miles from its mouth. It is an irregular mud-built place, but possesses several mosques and bazaars of some importance. Its principal manufactures are cotton goods and excellent muslins. There is a military cantonment a short distance from the now dismantled fort, and a small English church occupies the comer of the parade ground. A school where English is taught is supported by the London Missionary Society. The town formerly gave its name to one of the five Northern Circars. Its population is about 12,800.
