CERRO DE PASCO, a town of Peru, in the department of Junin, on the table-land of Bombon, 14,280 feet above sea-level. The houses are ill-built, and there are no public buildings of importance. Living is dear, the neighbourhood is unfertile, and the climate is cold and stormy. The silver mines, discovered in 1630, are numerous, but not so productive as in past times. Population, consisting chiefly of Indians and a mongrel race, about 13,000.
