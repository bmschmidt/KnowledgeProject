CASALE, a town of northern Italy, in the north cf the province of Alessandria. It is situated in a plain on the right bank of the Po, 38 miles east from Turin, and at a height of 249 feet above sea-level. Its fortress, founded in 1590, was strengthened and improved in 1849 under the direction of General de la Marmara. The town has been frequently besieged. It was taken from the Spaniards in 1640, and forty-one years later was sold to France by the duke of Mantua. It was taken inT695, but was recovered from the allies by the French, Since then, it has been twice retaken by the latter. Casale is the see of a bishop; and its cathedral, a Lombard structure, is said to have been founded in 742. The church of San Domenico, another fine edifice, consecrated in 1513, contains a monument of remarkably elegant design to the memory of the Palaeologi, erected in 1835. Other objects of interest are the churches of S. Ambrosio aud of S. Ilario (once a pagan temple), the town-house, the clock-tower, and the library. The town also contains a college, theatre, and several palaces of the nobility. Some trade is done in fruit, wine, hemp, and the so-called “syrup of Casale.” The principal manufacture is that of silk. Population, 27,514.
