CHARLES IV., the Fair (1294-1328), king of France and Navarre, was the third son of Philip the Fair. In 1322 he succeeded his brother Philip V. on the throne of France and Navarre. The chief aim of his domestic policy was to free the country from the Lombards and from the exactions of the barons and the judges; and he did something to improve the condition of the Jews. He assisted his sister Isabella in her contest with her husband r Edward II. of England. In 1325, being supported by the Pope, Charles sought the imperial crown, but without the least success.
