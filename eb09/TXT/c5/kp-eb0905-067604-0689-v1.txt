CHLAMYDOPHORE (Chlamydophorus truncatus), an Edentate Mammal found at Mendoza, on the eastern slope of the Cordilleras, where it is known as the Pichiciago, but is so seldom seen as to be regarded with curiosity even by the natives. Its total length is from 5 to 6 inches, and its upper surface is covered with a flexible cuirass somewhat resembling the external armature of the Armadilloes—its nearest allies—but differing from the latter in being attached only by the middle of the back and the top of the head, the frontal bone of the skull being provided with two prominent knobs for this purpose. The dorsal shield, which contains 24 rows of square, cubical, or rhomboidal plates of a leathery texture, makes, at its posterior edge, an abrupt bend downwards, and is continued to the extremity of the tail, thus forming a posterior shield for the protection of the creature’s hindquarters while it is burrowing. The sides of the back beneath the shield, the under part of the body, and the limbs are covered with silky hair, of a dirty white colour, longer and finer than that of the mole. An examination of the Pichiciago skeleton proves it to be an exceedingly aberrant member of the Armadillo family, having structural affinities with other and widely different mammals. Thus it resembles the beaver in its flattened paddle-like tail, the mole in its short strong legs and powerful claws, the sloth in its teeth, and ruminants in the form of the lower jaw. It also resembles the ornithorhynchus and echidna—the lowest mammalian forms—in points wherein all three show affinity with birds; while in the form of the skull and pelvis it is unique among mammals. According to Dr Buckland it makes the nearest approach of living Edentata to the gigantic extinct Megatherium, It is a burrowing animal, living like the mole in the subterranean galleries which it scoops out with its sharp, powerful claws, assisted probably by the flattened tail, which is supplied with strong muscles, and thus well adapted for throwing out the earth which gradually accumulates under the creature. Like the mole its ears and eyes are exceedingly small and almost hidden by the long silky hair surrounding them. Another species has recently been discovered in Bolivia somewhat larger than the preceding, and differing from it in having the dorsal shield attached all over to the skin of the back.
