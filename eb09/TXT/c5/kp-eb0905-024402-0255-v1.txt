CATTERMOLE, George (1800-1868), an English painter, chiefly in water-colours, was born at Dickleburgh, near Diss, Norfolk; in August 1800. At the age of sixteen he began working as an architectural and topographical draughtsman; afterwards he contributed designs to be engraved in the annuals then so fashionable and popular; thence he progressed into water-colour painting, becoming an associate of the Water-Colour Society in 1822, and a full member in 1833. In 1851 he withdrew from active connection with this society, and with the practice of watercolour painting, and took to oil-colouring. His most fertile period was between 1833 and 1851, In 1855, as an exhibitor in the British Fine Art section of the Great Exhibition in Paris (water-colour branch), he received one of the five first-class gold medals awarded to British painters. He also enjoyed professional honours in Amsterdam and in Belgium. He died on the 24th July 1868. Among his leading works are The Murder of the Bishop of Liège (1δth century), The Armourer relating the Story of the Sword, The Assassination of the Regent Murray by Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh, and (in oil) A Terrible Secret. He was largely employed by publishers, illustrating the Waverley Novels and the Historical Annual of his brother the Rev. Richard Cattermole (his scenes from the wars of Cavaliers and Roundheads in this series are among his best engraved works), and many other volumes besides. He is stated to have been “unsettled in his habits, and uncertain in engagements.” Cattermole was a painter of no inconsiderable gifts, and of great facility in picturesque resource; he was defective in solidity of form and texture, and in realism or richness of colour. He excelled in rendering scenes of chivalry, of mediaevalism, and generally of the romantic aspects of the past. Indeed, his faculty in this way might almost be compared—though on a considerably lower level, and with less of the spell of originality—to that of Walter Scott. Just as Scott was fading from the region of mediaeval romanticism in letters, Cattermole entered upon it in fine art.
