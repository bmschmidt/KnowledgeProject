CLAZOMENAe, now Kelisman, a town of Ionia, and a member of the Ionian Dodecapolis, or Confederation of Twelve Cities, on the Gulf of Smyrna, about 20 miles from that city in a south-west direction. It stood originally on the isthmus connecting the mainland with the peninsula on which were Erythrae and other towns of note; but the inhabitants, alarmed by the encroachments of the Persians, abandoned the continent and removed to one of the small islands of the bay, and there established their city in security, This island was connected with the mainland by Alexander the Great by means of a pier, the remains of which are still visible. Though Clazomenae was not in existence before the arrival of the Ionians in Asia, its original founders were only partly Ionians, the great proportion being Phliasians and Cleonaeans. It remained for some time subject to the Athenians, but about the middle of the Peloponnesian war it revolted. After a brief resistance, however, it again acknowledged the Athenian supremacy, and repelled the Lacedaemonians when they attempted to gain possession of the town. Under the Romans Clazomenae was included in the province of Asia, and enjoyed an immunity from taxation. The site of the city can still be made out, in the neighbourhood of Vourla, but nearly every portion of its ruins has been removed. Anaxagoras the philosopher was born in Clazomenae, 499 B.C.
