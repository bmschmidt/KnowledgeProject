CHEDUBA, an island in the Bay of Bengal, situated ten miles from the coast of Aracan, between 18° 40' and 18° 56' N. lat., and between 93° 3Γ and 93° 50' E. long. It extends about 20 miles in length from north to south, and 17 miles from east to west, and its area of 250 square miles supports a population of 10,000. The channel between the island and the mainland is navigable for boats, but not for large vessels. The surface of the interior is richly diversified by hill and dale, and in the southern portion some of the heights exceed a thousand feet in elevation. There are various indications of former [9:5:455] volcanic activity, and along the coast are earthy cones covered with green-sward, from which issue springs of muddy water emitting bubbles of gas. Copper, iron, and silver ore have been discovered; but the island is chiefly noted for its petroleum wells, the oil derived from which is of excellent quality, and is extensively used in the composition of paint, as it preserves wood from the ravages of insects. Timber is not abundant, but the gamboge tree and the wood-oil tree are found of a good size. Tobacco, cotton, sugar-cane, hemp, and indigo are grown, and the staple article is rice, which is of superior quality, and the chief article of export. The inhabitants of the island are mainly Mughs. Cheduba fell to the Burmese in the latter part of the last century. From them it was captured in 1824 by the British, whose possession of it was confirmed in 1826 by the treaty concluded with the Burmese at Yandaboo.
