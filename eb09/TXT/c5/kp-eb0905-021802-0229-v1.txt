CATANZARO, a city of Italy, capital of the province of Calabria Ulteriore IL, stands on the slope of a lofty and rocky hill near the Gulf of Squillace, 30 miles S.S.E. of Cosenza. It is the seat of a bishopric, and has a cathedral, several churches and convents, a castle, built by Robert Guiscard, a royal academy of sciences, a diocesan school, a college, a theatre, a foundling and two other hospitals, and other charitable institutions. It has manufactures of silk, velvet, and woollen goods, and a considerable trade in corn and wine and walnut oil. The most important fact in its history is the successful defence it made in the 16th century against the French general Lautrec. In 1783 many of its principal buildings were destroyed by an earthquake. Population, 24,900.
