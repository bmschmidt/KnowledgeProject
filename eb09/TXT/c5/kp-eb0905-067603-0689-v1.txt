CHIVASSO, a city of Italy, in the province of Turin, at a railway junction, 15 miles north-east of the city of Turin. Situated on the left bank of the Po near the influx of the Oreo, it was formerly considered the key of Piedmont; but its fortifications were dismantled by the French in 1804, and it is now only enclosed by a single wall with two gates leading to two suburbs. The front of the church of San Pietro, a building of the 15th century, is decorated with ornaments and entire statues in terra cotta, of great elegance, but much defaced. Of the ancient palace of the counts of Montferrat an octagonal tower still remains. The principal trade of the town is in grain and wool; and its lampreys are in repute. On the opposite side of the Po, and a few miles down the stream, are the ruins of the Roman city of Industria, which were discovered in 1745. Population, 7800.
