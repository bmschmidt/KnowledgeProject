CAREW, Thomas (1589-1639), an English poet, was born about the year 1589. He studied at Oxford, and on the completion of his course was made gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles I. At court he was highly esteemed for the vivacity of his wit and the elegance of his manners; and his poetical tastes gained him the friendship of Ben Jonson, Sir William Davenant, and other celebrated literary men. He wrote several sonnets, amorous pieces, and masques, which were set to music by Henry Lawes and other eminent masters. Most of his smaller pieces are distinguished by peculiar sweetness and gracefulness, by light gaiety, and by felicitous expression. They are generally occasional poems, vers de société, addressed to ladies, and are sometimes exquisite of their kind. His longest and best known work is a masque called Coelum Britannicum, performed by the king and several of the nobles at Whitehall on Shrove Tuesday, 1633. Parts in this masque were taken by Lord Brackley and his brother, who acted in the following year in Mdton’s Cornus. The Coelum is founded on the Spaccio della Bestia of Bruno (q.v.), and is a work of very considerable poetic merit. Some of the introductory verses remind strongly of Milton. Carew died in the prime of life about the year 1639. The best edition of his works is that of W. C. Hazlitt.
