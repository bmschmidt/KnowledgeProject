CARMAGNOLA, Francesco Bussone, Count of (1390-1432), one of the most celebrated Condottieri of the early part of the 15th century, was bom at Carmagnola in 1390. He was first in the service of Filippo Maria Visconti, duke of Milan, who raised him to the rank of count and made him governor of Genoa. Having, however, lost Viscontiâ€™s favour, Carmagnola became general of the Venetian army, wrested Brescia from the hands of his old master, and inflicted a severe defeat upon him at Maclodio (1427). But in 1431, having failed to prevent the defeat of the Venetian fleet, and having been unsuccessful in an attempt to surprise Cremona, he incurred the suspicion of the senate, who, not daring to show their disapproval while he was surrounded by his soldiers, lured him to Venice, and there tortured and beheaded him (1432).
