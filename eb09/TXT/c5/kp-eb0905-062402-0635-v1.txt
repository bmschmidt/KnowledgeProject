CHILLIANWALLA, a town of British India in the Punjab, situated on the left bank of the River Jhelum, about 85 miles north-west of Lahore, in 32° 40' N. lat. and 73° 39' E. long. It is memorable as the scene of a sanguinary battle fought there on the 13th January 1849, between a British force commanded by Lord Gough and the Sikh army under Shere Singh. The loss of the British in killed and wounded amounted to 2269, of whom nearly 1000 were Europeans, while that of the Sikhs was estimated at 4000. An obelisk erected at Chillianwalla by the British Government preserves the names of the officers and men who fell in the action.
