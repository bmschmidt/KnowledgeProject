CHILEAN, a town of Chili, the capital of the province of Nubie, in a depression in the fertile plain between the rivers Nubie and Chillan, about 120 miles north-east of Concepcion, in 35° 56' S. lat. and 71° 37' W. long. The houses, with but few exceptions, consist of only a ground floor built round a rectangular court, and are constructed of sun-dried or baked bricks. The streets are about 22 yards wide and have open drains in the middle. The importance of the town consists in its being the centre of a large agricultural district of the greatest productiveness, which has a valuable outlet for its grain and cattle by means of the railway to Tomé. Hand-made lace is produced on designs which have become traditional in certain families. The district is also celebrated for its mineral baths. Chillan was originally founded by Ruiz de Gamboa in 1594, but it has since been frequently destroyed and rebuilt. In 1601 it was laid waste by the Moluche Indians, in 1657 by the Puelche Indians and an earthquake, by another earthquake in 1751, and in 1797 by the overflow of the River Nubie. This last catastrophe led the inhabitants to remove their city to a place called La Korea, where it was again levelled by the earthquake of 1835. Next year they began to build on the present site the now prosperous town, which has a population of 20,000.
