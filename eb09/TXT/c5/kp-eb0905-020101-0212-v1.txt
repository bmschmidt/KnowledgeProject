CASTRENSIS, Paulus, a distinguished professor of civil and canon law, who studied under Ba]dus at Perugia, and was a fellow pupil with Cardinal Zabarella. He was admitted to the degree of doctor of civil law in the university of Avignon. It is uncertain when he first undertook the duties of a professorial chair. A tradition, which has been handed down by Panzirolus, represents him to have taught law during a period of fifty-seven years. He was professor at Vienna in 1390, at Avignon in 1394, and at Padua in 1429; and he filled at different periods a professorial chair at Florence, at Bologna, and at Perugia, but at what precise periods is not known. He was for some time the vicar-general of Cardinal Zabarella at Florence, and his eminence as a teacher of canon law may be inferred from the language of one of his pupils, who styles him “famosissimus juris utriusque monarca.” His most complete treatise is his readings on the Digest, and it appears from a passage in his readings on the Digestum Vetus that he delivered them at a time when he had been actively engaged for forty-five years as a teacher of civil law. His death is generally assigned to 1436, but it appears from an entry in a MS. of the Digestum Vetus, which is extant at Munich, made by the hand of one of his pupils, who styles him “praeceptor meus,” that he died on the 20th July 1441.
