CLEMENT, François (1714—1793-), a French historian, was born at Brézé, near Dijon, and was educated at the Jesuit College at Dijon. At the age of seventeen he entered the society of the Benedictines at Saint Maur, and worked with such intense application that at the age of twenty-five he was obliged to take a protracted rest. He now resided in Paris, where he wrote the 11th and 12th vols, of the Histoire littéraire de la France. Clément also revised the Art de vérifier les dates (1783-92). The king appointed him on the committee which was engaged in publishing maps, acts, and other documents connected with French history, and the Academy of Subscriptions chose him as a member. He was engaged in preparing another edition of the Art de vérifier les dates, which was to include the period before the Christian era, when he died suddenly of apoplexy at the age of sixty-nine. (The work was afterwards brought down from 1770 to 1827 by Cy Courcelles and D'Urban.)
