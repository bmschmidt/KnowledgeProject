CASTELL, Edmund (c. 1606-1685), a learned English Orientalist, was born about 1606, at Hatley, in Cambridgeshire. At the age of fifteen he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, but he afterwards changed his residence to St John’s, where he enjoyed the use of a valuable library. His great work was the compiling of his Lexicon Ueptaglotton Hebraicum, Chaldaicum, Syriacum, Samaritanum, Aethiopicum, Arabicum,et Persicum (London, 1669). Over this book he spent eighteen years, working (if we may accept his own statement) from sixteen to eighteen hours a day; he employed fourteen assistants, and by an expenditure of £12,000 brought himself to poverty, for his lexicon, though full of the most unusual learning, did not find purchasers. His loss was partly compensated by a number of preferments, including a prebend at Canterbury, and the professorship of Arabic at Cambridge. Castell also lent the aid of his erudition to the preparation of Dr Walton’s well-known Polyglott Bible. His MSS. he bequeathed to the University of Cambridge.
