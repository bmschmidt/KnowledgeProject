CHILOE, an island off the coast of Chili, separated from the mainland on the N. by the narrow strait of Chacao, and on the E. by the archipelago of the Gulf of Ancud and Corcovado Bay. It is situated between 41° 45' and 43° 30' S. lat., and extends in length about 120 miles from N. to S.; its greatest breadth is about 50 miles, and its total area is estimated at 5200 square miles. The western or seaward coast is for the most part steep, and in some places rises to a height of 3000 feet; the eastern contrasts with it not only in its smaller elevation but also in the extreme irregularity of its outline. There are several lakes in the southern portion of the island, of which the most extensive bears the name of Lago de Cucao. The interior is mountainous and but partially explored. The whole island is divided into the five departments of Ancud or San Carlos, Chacao, Dalcahue, Castro, and Chonchi. Ancud, the capital and the bishop’s seat, is a regularly-built town, with a population of 7000. The total population of the province amounted in 1875 to 64,536. In 1558 the island and the neighbouring archipelago were discovered by Garcia de Mendoza, and not long afterwards were taken possession of by Spain. On the expulsion of the Spanish forces from the rest of Chili in 1818 they settled in Chiloé; but in 1826 the island likewise was abandoned, and since that period it has formed one of the Chilian provinces. The most valuable article of commerce is the timber of the [9:5:626] Chilian cedar, the Fitzroya pαtαgonicα, which is exported in small planks. The next article in importance is the potato, which is indigenous, and which is produced in annually increasing quantities as land is cleared of forest. Signs of coal-beds of considerable size and value have been discovered in the island. See Chili.
