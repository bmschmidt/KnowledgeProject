CHANDLER, Samuel, D.D. (1693-1766), a learned Dissenting minister, was born at Hungerford, in Berkshire, where his father was an eminent Nonconformist minister. He was sent to school at Gloucester, where he commenced a life-long friendship with Bishop Butler and Archbishop Seeker; and he afterwards studied at Leyden. His talents and learning were such that he was elected fellow of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, and was made D.D. of Edinburgh and Aberdeen. He also received offers of high preferment in the Established church. These he decidedly refused, remaining to the end of his life in the position of a Presbyterian minister. For some time he preached at Peckham, and for forty years he was pastor of the meetinghouse in the Old Jewry. During two or three years, having fallen into pecuniary distress through the failure of the South Sea Scheme, he kept a book-shop in the Poultry. On the death of George II. Chandler published a sermon in which he compared that king to King David. This view was attacked in a pamphlet entitled Ths History of ths Man after God's own Heart, in which the author complained of the parallel as an insult to the late king, and, following Bayle, exhibited king David as an example of perfidy, lust, and cruelty. Chandler condescended to reply in A Critical History of the Life of David, which is perhaps the best of his productions. This work was just completed when he died, on May 8, 1766. He left 4 vols, of sermons (1768), and commentaries on St Paulâ€™s Epistles to the Galatians, Ephesians, and Thessalonians (1777), several works on the evidences of Christianity, and a work on subscription to articles of faith (1748).
