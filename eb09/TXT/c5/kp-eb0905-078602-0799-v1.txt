CINQ-MARS, Henri Coiffier de Ruz√©, Marquis de (1620-1642), French courtier, was born in 1620. At the age of eighteen he was introduced to the court by Richelieu, who had been the patron of his father, and who intended him to fill the post of favourite to the king, Louis XIII. The design succeeded well, and Cinq-Mars became grand master of the wardrobe, and grand master of the horse. He developed into a gallant courtier, won the affection of the princess of Mantua, and claimed a seat in the royal council. But Richelieu opposed his ambition, and refused to countenance his pretensions. Cinq-Mars, therefore, in revenge,, entered into the conspiracy against him, of which the duke of Orleans was nominal head. Unfortunately aid had been, sought from Spain; and using this treason as an argument, Richelieu persuaded the weak and fickle king first to forbid Cinq-Mars to enter his presence, and then to permit his execution (1642).
