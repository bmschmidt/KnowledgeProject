CHEVIOT HILLS, a range extending a distance of about 35 miles along the confines of England and Scotland, mainly situated in Northumberland, but partly also in Roxburgh. The western portion consists principally of carboniferous strata, while the eastern is chiefly composed of igneous rocks. They attain their greatest height, of 2684 feet, in Cheviot Peak, which lies eight miles southwest of Wooler, in Northumberland; and next in elevation is Carter Fell, which slightly exceeds 2000 feet. The range is now chiefly famous for a valuable breed of sheep, which find abundant pasture on its smooth declivities; but in earlier days it was the scene of many an episode of border warfare, and its name is inseparably associated with the ballad of Chevy Chase.
