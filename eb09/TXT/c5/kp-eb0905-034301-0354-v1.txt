CENTUMVIRI, among the Romans, were judges appointed to decide common causes among the people, of whom three were chosen out of each tribe. The extent of their powers has not been exactly ascertained. It is not unlikely that they were originally intended to deal with questions concerning quiritian ownership, which determined the status of the citizens. Hollweg asserted that their jurisdiction was confined to civil cases; but this is doubtful. (See HolΓweg, Ueber die Competent des Centum-viralgerichts ; Tigerström, De Judicibus apud Romanos).
