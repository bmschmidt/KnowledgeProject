CASWALL, Henry, D.D. (1810-1870), was born at Yateley, Hampshire, and educated chiefly at the grammar school of Chigwell, Essex. At the age of eighteen he went to the United States, and graduated in arts at Kenyon College, Ohio. After being engaged for several years as a parish minister and a professor of theology in America, he returned to England in 1842, obtained a private Act of Parliament recognizing the validity of his ordination in the United States, was appointed to the vicarage of Kgheldean, Wiltshire, and became proctor in Convocation for the diocese of Sarum, and prebendary of Salisbury Cathedral. He received the honorary degree of Îœ. A. from the university of Oxford, and that of D.D. from Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut. Caswall went back to the United States about two years before his death, which occurred at Franklin, Pennsylvania, December 17, 1870. The main object of his life was to promote the consolidation and to increase the power of the great religious organization connected with the English Reformation. His principal work is America and the American Church, 1839; 2d edition, 1851. He also wrote two works on Mormonism; Scotland and the Scottish Church; The Western World Revisited, 1854; and The Martyr of the Pong as, a memoir of the Rev. H. J. Seacock.
