CASSEL, a town of France, in the department of Nord, and arrondissement of Hazebrouck, is situated 28 miles N.W. of Lille, on an isolated hill, 800 feet high, which commands a most extensive view in all directions. Portions of the three kingdoms of France, Belgium, and England can be seen, with 32 towns and 100 villages, including St Omer, Dunkirk, Ypres, and Ostend. The public buildings comprise a castle, a communal college, and a museum; and the ancient mansion known as La Noble Cour de Cassel is classed among the historic monuments of France. The manufactures of the town are lace, thread, stockings, pottery, leather, and oil; and it also trades in cattle. It is supposed to occupy the site of the Castellum Morinorum, and was certainly a Roman station, as the numerous [9:5:184] remains of the Gallo-Roman period sufficiently attest It is frequently mentioned in the wars of the Middle Ages, and was the scene of important battles in 1071, 1328, and 1677. In 1771 General Vandamme was born in the town. Population in 1872, 3250.
