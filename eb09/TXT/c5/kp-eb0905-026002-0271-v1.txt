CAVALCANTI, Guido, an Italian poet and philosopher of the 13th century, who died in 1300. He was the son of a philosopher whom Dante, in the Inferno, condemns to torment among the Epicureans and Atheists; but he himself was a friend of the great poet. By marriage with the daughter of Farinata Uberti, he became head of the Ghibellines; and when the people, weary of continual brawls, aroused themselves, and sought peace by banishing thô leaders of the rival parties, he was sent to Sarzana, where he caught a fever, of which he died. Cavalcanti has left a number of love sonnets and canzoni, which were honoured by the praise of Dante. Some are simple and graceful, but many are spoiled by a mixture of metaphysics borrowed from Plato, Aristotle, and the Christian Fathers. They are mostly in honour of a French lady, whom he calls Mandetta. His Canzone P Amore was extremely popular, and was frequently published; and his complete poetical works are contained in Giunti’s collection, Florence, 1527, Venice, 1531-2. He also wrote in prose on philosophy and oratory.
