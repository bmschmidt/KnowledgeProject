CARRICK-ON-SUIR, a town of Ireland in the south riding of the county of Tipperary, province of Munster, is situated on the Suir, 14 miles east of Clonmel, with a station on the Waterford and Limerick railway. It was formerly a walled town, and contains some very ancient buildings, such as the parish church and the castle, erected in 1309, which belongs to the Butler family. On the other side of the river, but connected by a bridge of the 14th century, stands the suburb of Carrickbeg, with an abbey founded in 1336. The woollen manufactures for which the town was formerly famous still give employment to about 400 people; and upwards of 1000 areat work in the linen and flax factories. A thriving export trade is carried on in agricultural produce, and slate is extensively quarried in the neighbourhood. Carrick-on-Suir became a place of importance soon after the English conquest of Ireland, and it still gives the title of earl to a branch of the Butler family. Population in 1871, 7792.
