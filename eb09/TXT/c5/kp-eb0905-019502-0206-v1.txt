CASTIGLIONE DELLE STIVIERE, a town of Italy, in the province of Brescia, 20 miles north-west of Mantua. It has a castle, a theatre, and two fine churches, and was formerly the capital of a small principality dependent on the duchy of Mantua. In 1796 the Austrians, under Wurmser, were defeated there by Marshal Augereau, who was afterwards rewarded by Napoleon with the title of duke of Castiglione. Population, 5237. This town must not be confounded with Castiglione Fioretino, a flourishing township, about 11 miles south of Arezzo by rail, which is chiefly engaged in the culture of the silk-worm.
