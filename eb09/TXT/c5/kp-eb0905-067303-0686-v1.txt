CHINCHILLA, a city of Spain, in the province of Murcia, picturesquely situated on an abrupt hill ten miles south-east of Albacete, in the immediate neighbourhood of the junction of the railway lines from Cartagena and Valencia to the capital. It is surrounded by walls rebuilt in 1837, and defended by a citadel; and in the principal church there are reservoirs capable of furnishing the city with water for several months. Earthenware and crucibles, coarse linen, and woollen cloths are manufactured. Population, 3500.
