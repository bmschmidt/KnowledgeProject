CHABRIAS, a celebrated Athenian general, who first assumed the command about the year 392 b.c. He defeated the Spartans at Aegina (388), and again at Naxos (376). With Iphicrates and Callistratus he commanded at Corcyra, and repulsed Epaminondas before the walls of Corinth. In 366, together with Callistratus, he was accused of treachery in advising the surrender of Oropus to the Thebans, and was then, it is said, defended by Plato. His unpopularity on account of this charge, and also on account of his ostentation and luxuriousness, led him to accept a foreign command under Tachos, king of Egypt, who had revolted from the Persians. On the breaking out of the Social War (357), he, however, joined Chares in the command of the Athenian fleet. At the siege of Chios his ship was disabled, but he refused to flee, and fell fighting bravely. He was famous for the invention of a manoeuvre, [9:5:371] which consisted in receiving a charge on the left knee, with the spears of the front ranks pointed against the enemy and the shields resting on the ground.
