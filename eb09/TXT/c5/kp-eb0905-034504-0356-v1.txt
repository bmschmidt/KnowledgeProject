CERIGNOLA, a town of Italy, in â…›he south of the Neapolitan province of Capitanata, 24 miles S.E. of Foggia, pleasantly situated on an eminence which commands an extensive view. The surrounding plain is well cultivated, and produces large quantities of almonds and cotton. Linen is manufactured by the inhabitants. Cerignola is divided into an old and new town, and contains a hospital, a college, and several convents. Here, on the 28th April 1503, the Spaniards, under Gonsalvo de Cordova, defeated [9:5:346] the French, when the leader of the latter, the Due de Nemours, was slain. In the neighbourhood, to the west of the Lago di Salpi, are the ruins of the ancient Apulian town Salapia. Population about 17,500.
