CAZORLA, a town of Spain, in the province of Jaen, on the Vega. It is generally well built, and contains two ancient castles (one of them Arabic), several hospitals, a spacious theatre, a very ancient church, and several convents. It was an important military station under the Moors, and has suffered frequently during the civil wars in Spain. In 1811 it was captured and partly burned by the French, and in 1837 it was distinguished in the Carlist contest. Population, 4980.
