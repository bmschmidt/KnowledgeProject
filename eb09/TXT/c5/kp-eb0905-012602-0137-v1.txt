CAROUGE, a town of Switzerland, in the canton of Geneva, and about two miles south of that city, with which it is connected by a horse-railway. It is situated in the midst of fine orchards and meadows; and the neighbourhood is thickly studded with villas. Cotton-spinning and the manufacturing of leather and pottery are the principal industries. About 1780 King Victor Amadeus of Savoy endeavoured to attract the workmen of Geneva to Carouge, and thus to render it the rival of the greater city; but the occupation of his country by the Revolutionary forces in 1792 prevented the success of the undertaking. The population in 1870 was 5871.
