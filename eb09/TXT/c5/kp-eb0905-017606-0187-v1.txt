CASPE, a city of Spain, in the province of Aragon, about 55 miles south-east of Saragossa on the banks of the River Guadaloupe, which runs into the Ebro a short distance below the town. Its prosperity isâ€™ due to the mines of iron and of coal which abound in its vicinity, and which have given rise to manufactories. It has a castle and several convents and hospitals, and is famous in history as the scene of the congress of the Aragonians, Catalonians, and Valencians in 1412, which elected Ferdinand of Castile to the throne. It was captured from the Moors by Alphonse II. in 1168, and bestowed on the knights of St John. Population in 1867, 9402.
