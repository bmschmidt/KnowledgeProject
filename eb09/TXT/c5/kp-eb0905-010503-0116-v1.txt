CARIMATA ISLANDS, a group iu the East Indian Archipelago, lying to the West of Borneo, between that island and Billiton, in the channel to which they give their [9:5:106] name. They are about sixty in number, but their united area is not more than 170 square miles. The most important are Great Caπmata (with a peak rising to about 2000 feet), Panumbangan, the Pelapis Islands, Lissing, Bessi, Maledang, Surutu, and Pulu Lima. Their principal productions are edible nests, honey, wax, gutta percha, turtles, trepang, and shellfish. At one time the cluster formed a small independent principality; but it afterwards became subject ’ to Matan, and it is now attached to Pontianak. Several of the islands are altogether uninhabited, and the whole population is very small. See Veth’s Woordenboek van Nederl. Indie.
