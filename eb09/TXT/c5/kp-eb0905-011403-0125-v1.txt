CARMAGNOLA, a town of Italy, near the right bank of the Po, in the province of Turin, and 16 miles by rail to the south of that city. It was formerly fortified, and the older portion is still surrounded with walls, while a fragment of its ancient castle is preserved in the form of a tower to the church of San Filippo. It contains five parish churches, several convents, and a hospital. A considerable trade is carried on, especially at the fair in June, in silk, flax, hemp, and cattle. Population in 1869, 12,799. Carmagnola, during the Middle Ages, belonged to the marquises of Saluzzo, and formed one of their frontier towns. In the 16th century it was fortified by the French, but it fell into the hands of the Savoyards in 1588, and was assigned to them at the peace of 1601. On its capture in 1792 by the army of the Revolution, its name became famous as the title of a republican dancing-song which finished every verse with the refrainâ€” Dansons la Carmagnole, Vive le son du canon. The word thus introduced to popularity was soon applied to a vest of common stuff and peculiar shape, which was recognized as the sign of a true Republican; and not long after it was jocularly used to designate the exaggerated reports that were published of the victories of the patriot army.
