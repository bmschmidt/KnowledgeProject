CLART, Giovanni Carlo Maria, chapel-masterat Pistoia, was born at Pisa in 1669. The time of his death is unknown. He was the most celebrated pupil of Colonna, chapel-master of S. Petronio, at Bologna. The works by which Clari distinguished himself pre-eminently are his vocal duets and trios, with a continued bass, published in 1720. In these beautiful and learned compositions the tonal responses and modulations are in the modern style. An edition of these duets and trios, with a pianoforte accompaniment, was published at Paris in 1823, by Mirecki, a Polish musician, and a pupil of Cherubini. In such esteem were these compositions held by Cherubini, that, in the course of his studies, he repeatedly transcribed them with his own hand, as models of excellence. Clari composed one opera, Il Savio Delirante, and for the church a Stabat and four other works.
