CASTEL VETRANO, a town of Sicily, near the southeast extremity of the island, 12 miles east of Mazzara, in the province of Trapani. It is well and regularly built, and has a population of about 20,000, many of whom are hereditary tenants of the dukes of Monteleone, who have a palace in the town. Near it are the ruins of the ancient city Selinus, which was destroyed by the Carthaginians 409 B.c.
