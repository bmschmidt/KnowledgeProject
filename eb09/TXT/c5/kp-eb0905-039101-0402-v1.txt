CHANDLER, Richard, D.D. (1738-1810), a British antiquary, was bom in 1738, at Elson in Hampshire, and was educated at Winchester school, and Queen’s College, Oxford. His first work consisted of fragments from the minor Greek poets, with notes (1759); and in 1763 he published a fine edition of the Arundelian marbles, Mαrmοrα Oxοηieηsia, with a Latin translation, and a number of suggestions for supplying the lacunae. In 1763 Chandler, together with Revett, the architect, and Pars, a painter, was sent by the Dilettanti Society to explore the antiquities of Ionia and Greece. After spending above a year in Asia Minor the travellers passed another year in Greece, examining Attica and the Peloponnesus, and returned to England in the end of 1766. The result of their joint investigations was the two magnificent folios of Ionian antiquities published in 1769. Chandler also published a very valuable collection of inscriptions, entitled Inscriptiones Antiquoe pleroeque nondum editoe, in Asia Minore et Groecia, proesertim Athenis, collectas (Oxford, 1774). In 1775 he published his Travels in Asia Minor ; in 1776 his Travels in Greece; andin 1800 his History of Iliτιm, in which he asserted the accuracy of Homer’s geography. His Life of Bishop Waynflete, Lord High Chancellor to Henry VI., did not appear tül after his death, in 1811. After his return from Greece, Chandler obtained several church preferments, including the rectory of Tylehurst, in Berkshire; and after marrying and travelling for some time in Switzerland and Italy, he settled down in England, where he died in 1810.
