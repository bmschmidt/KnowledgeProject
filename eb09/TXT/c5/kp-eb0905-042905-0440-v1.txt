It is much frequented in summer by visitors from Berlin. The castle, built in 1696 for the queen of Frederick I., the electress Sophia Charlotte, after whom the town was named, contains a collection of antiquities and paintings. In the castle grounds there is an extensive orangery, as also a granite mausoleum, the work of Schenkel, with monuments of Frederick William III. and Queen Louise by Rauch. The population in 1871 was 19,518.
