CARIGNANO, a town of northern Italy, in the province of Turin, and about 20 miles south of that city, is situated on the left bank of the Po, here crossed by a wooden bridge. It is surrounded by old walls, and has a handsome church, built in 1766, according to the design of Alfieri, a communal college, and several convents. The population, numbering about 8000, is chiefly engaged in the spinning of silk and the manufacture of confectionery, the principal department in the latter industry being the preparation of the citron rind.

Carignano, known in the early part of the Middle Ages as Car-nianum andCarganum, passed in 1418 into the hands of the counts of Savoy, who fortified it with rampart and ditch. In 1630 it was bestowed by Charles Emmanuel I. on his son Tommaso Francesco, who thus became known as prince of Carignano. The title continued in the possession of his family, until they were called to the throne in the person of Charles Albert. It was bestowed in 1834 on Eugene Emmanuel Joseph, who now holds the rank of admiral and commander-in-chief of the Italian National Guards.
