CATAMARCA, or, in its full form, San Fernando de Catamarca, the capital of the province of the same name in the Argentine Republic, is situated in 28 a 20' S. lat. and 66Â° 25' W. long. It is pretty regularly built, has a large square, with an obelisk in memory of the achievement of national independence, and numbers among its public buildings a small townhouse, a fort, a Franciscan monastery, and a Santa Teresa convent. The old establishment of the Mercedarios, for some time possessed by the Jesuits, now serves as a high school. The import trade, even of European goods, is considerable, as the town is a centre of distribution for an extensive and flourishing district. Dried figs, wine, brandy, and cotton are the principal articles of export; the copper, for which the province is so well known, is from another district. The present town of Catamarca only dates from 1685, when it replaced the old town of Chacra, the ruins of which are still to be seen a short distance to the north, at a spot which was found both unhealthy and exposed to inundation. Chacra had shortly before, in 1679, been appointed capital instead [9:5:218] of San Juan de Londres, which had been founded in 1558. Population about 6000.
