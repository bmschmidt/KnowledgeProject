CHERSONESE, Chersonesus, or Cherronesus (from χέρσος, mainland, and vησoς, island), is a word equivalent to peninsula. In ancient geography, the Chersonesus Thracica, Chersonesus Taurica or Scythica, and Chersonesus Cimbrica correspond respectively to the peninsula of the Dardanelles, the Crimea, and Jutland; and the Golden Chersonese (η χρυσή χepp6vησoς) is usually identified with the peninsula of Malacca. The Tauric Chersonese was further distinguished as the Great, in contrast to the Heracleotic or Little Chersonese at its south-western corner, where the town of Sebastopol now stands.
