CLAUDIUS, Marcus Aurelius, Gothicus, the second of the Roman emperors of the name of Claudius, was born in Hlyria or Dardania in the first half of the 3d century. On account of his military ability he was placed in command of an army by Decius; and Valerian appointed him general on the Illyrian frontier, and ruler of the provinces of the lower Danube. During the reign of Gallienus, he was called to Italy in order to crush Aureolus; and, on the death of the emperor (268 a.d.) he was chosen as his successor, in accordance, it was said, with his express desire. He enjoyed great popularity, and, as far as we can now judge, he appears to have been a man of considerable ability and strength of character. The account of his reign belongs to the history of Rome.
