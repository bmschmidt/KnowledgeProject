CAPO D’ISTRIA, a fortified seaport town of Austria, in the government of Trieste and circle of Istria. It stands on a small island in the Gulf of Trieste, 8 miles south of that city, in 45°.32' 20" N. lat. and,13° 42' 29" E. long., and is connected with the mainland by a causeway half a mile in length. It is the seat of a bishopric, and has a cathedral and about thirty other churches, a citadel, a gymnasium, a prison, and a theatre. It manufactures salt, sugar, leather, and soap; it also exports wine, oil, and fish. The harbour is large, but is little frequented except by fishing-boats. Population in 1869, 9169. Capo d’Istria is usually identified with the town of Aegida, mentioned by Pliny, which appears by an inscription to have afterwards received the name of Justinopolis from Justin II. At a later period it formed a free commonwealth, which was subjugated by the Venetians in the 10th century, fell into the hands of the Genoese in 1380, and was recaptured by the Venetians in 1487. As capital of Istria it passed into Austrian possession in 1797.
