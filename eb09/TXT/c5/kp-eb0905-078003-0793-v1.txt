CIMON, an Athenian statesman, was the son of Miltiades. His father died in disgrace, leaving the fine which had been imposed on him unpaid. After a time it was paid by Cimon, who, according to one account, also took his place in prison. Distinguished by military ability, by a gentle and agreeable temper, and by the most open-handed liberality, Cimon gradually rose to the front rank among his contemporaries. His victorious attacks on the Persians, his ostracism, his request for leave to fight at Tanagra, and his recall on the motion of his rival Pericles are matters of history. (See Greece.) He died while besieging Citium, 449 b.c.
