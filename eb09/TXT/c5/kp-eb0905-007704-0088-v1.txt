CAPRERA, or Cabrera, a small island of Italy, in the Mediterranean, two miles off the north-east coast of Sardinia, in 41° 12' 47" N. lat. and 9° 29' 14" E. long. It forms one of the Buccinarian group, and belongs to the province of Sassari. The most of its surface of 6700 acres is rocky and unfertile; and till the present century it was only occasionally visited. In 1854 Garibaldi acquired possession of a part of the island, and built himself a house, which has been his principal place of residence since that date. See Vecchj, Garibaldi at C aprer a, 1862.
