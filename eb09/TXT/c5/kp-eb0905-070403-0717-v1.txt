CHRISTOPOULOUS, Athanasias (1772-1847), a modern Greek poet, was the son of a Greek priest settled [9:5:705] in Wallachia. He studied at Buda and Padua, and became teacher of the children of the Wallachian prince Mourousi. After the fall of that prince in 1811, he was employed by Prince Caradja, who had been appointed hospodar of Moldavia and Wallachia, in drawing up a code of laws for that country. On the removal of Caradja, he retired into private life and gave himself to literature. He wrote drinking songs and love ditties which are very popular among the Greeks. He is also the author of a tragedy, of Parallela (a comparison of various systems of government), of translations of Homer and Herodotus, and of some philological works on the connection between ancient and modern Greek.
