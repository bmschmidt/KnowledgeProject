CASTEL-A-MARE, or Castellamare, a city and seaport of Italy, on the Gulf of Naples, 15 miles by rail southeast of the city of that name. It is situated on the lower slopes of Monte Santâ€™ Angelo (the ancient Mons Gaurus), and along a sheltered beach, commanding an extensive view of the Bay of Naples from Vesuvius to Misenum. It stands near the site of the ancient Stabioe, which was destroyed by Sulla in the social war, but continued to exist as a small place till 79 ad., when it was overwhelmed along with Pompeii and Herculaneum by the great eruption of Vesuvius, and became for ever celebrated as the death-scene of the elder Pliny. The castle, from which the city takes its name, was erected by Frederick II., surrounded by walls and towers in the 13th century by Charles I. of Anjou, and strengthened by additional fortifications by Alphonse I. of Aragon. Castel-a-mare is the seat of a bishopric, and has a royal palace, a cathedral, several churches and convents, a military hospital, barracks, a handsome quay, a royal arsenal, and a dockyard, where the large ships of the Neapolitan navy were formerly built. In shipbuilding it still ranks second of the Italian towns; and there are manufactures of linen, silk and cotton goods, and leather. The port is small, and divided by two forts. The hill immediately above the town is covered with villas and casinos. The royal casino of Quisisana, originally built by Charles II. of Anjou, was restored by Ferdinand I. of Naples. It is more remarkable for its fine prospect than for its magnificence as a palace. Population about 26,000.
