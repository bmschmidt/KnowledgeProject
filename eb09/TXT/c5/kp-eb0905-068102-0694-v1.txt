CHOISEUL, César, Due de (1598-1675), commonly known as Marshal du Plessis, was born at Paris in 1598. He commanded a regiment at the siege of Rochelle, and defended Oléron and Ré against the English. He was employed by Richelieu against the Spaniards, both as general and envoy, and in both capacities he met with considerable success. He was engaged under Mazarin in the war of the Fronde against Turenne, whom he defeated at Rethel; and he was also concerned in the negotiations of Louis XIV. with Charles II. of England. He became duke in 1665, and died in 1675.
