CHICHELY, or Chichele, Henry (1362-1443), an English primate, was born at Higham Ferrers, in Northamptonshire, in 1362. After studying at Oxford, he was sent on various embassies to the Papal and French courts; in 1409, he was representative of England in the Council of Pisa, which deposed Gregory and Benedict, and elevated Alexander V. to the papacy; and, in 1414, he became archbishop of Canterbury. He was distinguished for his zeal in the cause of the English Church, which he defended against the pretension of the Pope to dispose of ecclesiastical preferments. He was also, on the other hand, a determined opponent of Wycliffe. He spent much of his wealth in the establishment of All Soulâ€™s College, Oxford, and in adorning Canterbury Cathedral and Lambeth Palace.
