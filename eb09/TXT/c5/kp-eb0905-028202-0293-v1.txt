CEBES of Thebes, a disciple of Socrates, mentioned by Plato in the Phoedo, and by Xenophon as distinguished both for his virtue and for his love of truth, was the author of a once popular didactic dialogue, the Híva£ or Tabula Cebetis. This work, which professes to be an explanation of an allegorical picture, commences with the Platonic doctrine that men enter the earth from a pre-existent state. There they have been taught how to guide their course in this world; but the draught of oblivion of which all must drink—though not all in equal degree—causes them to forget the instruction. Many allurements entice them to vice, but by patience and endurance they may attain virtue and happiness. The sciences—grammar, geography, arithmetic, geometry, and music—are declared not to be the true discipline, but yet to be useful, especially as a kind of restraining bridle for the young. From certain passages, which are pιobably interpolations, some have supposed the work to be the production of a Stoic of the same name, who lived under Μ. Aurelius. The Tabula Cebetis has been translated into all the European languages. An Arabic version, with the Greek text, and a Latin translation, was published by Salmasius in 1640. It is usually printed together with Epictetus, as at Strasburg, 1806, and Paris, 1826. Cebes was also, according to Suidas and Laertius, the author of the t Eβδoμη and the Φpυvικoς, which have been entirely lost.
