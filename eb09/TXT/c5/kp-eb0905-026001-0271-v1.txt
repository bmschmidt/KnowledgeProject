CAVAILLON, a town of France and important railway junction in the department of Vaucluse, on the right bank of the Durance, about 13 miles south-east of Avignon. The town is ill-built and dirty, and carries on a considerable trade in dried fruits, madder, and other productions of the fertile district in which it is situated. It has a fine townhouse, an old church of the 12th century, dedicated to the Virgin and St Veran, and the mutilated remains of a triumphal arch which probably belongs to the time of Constantine. Numerous minor relics of the Roman period have been found to the south of the present town, on the site of the ancient Cabellio, a place of some note in the territory of the Cavares. In mediaeval and modern history the town has for the most part followed the fortunes of the Comtat Venaissin, in which it was included; and down to the Revolution it was the see of a bishop, and had a large number of monastic establishments. Population in 1872, 3906 in the town, and 8034 in the commune.
