CARYL, Joseph (1602-1673), a learned Nonconformist clergyman, was born in London in 1602. He was educated at Exeter College, Oxford, and after leaving the university became preacher at Lincolnâ€™s Inn. By order of the Parliament he attended Charles I. in Holmby House, and in 1650 he was sent with Owen to accompany Cromwell to Scotland. After the Restoration he continued to officiate in an Independent congregation in London till his death in 1673. Caryl is now remembered only for his learned but ponderous commentary on Job, originally published in twelve volumes 4 to, afterwards in two huge volumes folio.
