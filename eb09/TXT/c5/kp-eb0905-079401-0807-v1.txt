CITEAUX, or Cisteaux, a village in France, in the department of Côte d’Or, about 7 miles east of the town of Nuits, and 12 from Dijon. It is celebrated for the great abbey founded by Robert de Molesme in 1098, which became the head-quarters of the Cistercian order (see last article). The buildings are now occupied as a reformatory for juvenile criminals; and in the neighbourhood is an extensive agricultural college.
