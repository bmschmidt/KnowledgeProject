CATHOLIC (Gr. καθολικός, general, universal), a designation adopted at a very early period by the Christian church to indicate its world wide universality in contrast with the national particularism of Judaism. It has also been used by ecclesiastical writers, from Ignatius downwards, to denote the church as the depository of universally-received doctrine (quod semper, quod ubique, et quod ab omnibus) in contrast with heretical sects. In the latter or exclusive sense it is still claimed on the ground of historic continuity by the Roman Catholic Church; but the claim, in so far as it is exclusive, is, of course, not recognized by other Christian denominations.
