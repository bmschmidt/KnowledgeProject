CHILLICOTHE, a city of the United States, capital of the county of Ross in Ohio, on the west bank of the River Scioto, 45 miles south of Columbus. It is beautifully situated in the midst of a rich agricultural district, and has extensive communication by means of the Ohio and Erie canal, and several railway lines. Its public buildings, many of which are an ornament to the town, comprise a large court-house, which cost over $100,000, fourteen churches, and thirty-six public schools; and among its industrial establishments are carriage-factories, flour and paper mills, an iron foundry, and a manufactory of agricultural implements. Chillicothe was founded in 1796 by immigrants from Virginia and Kentucky, and from 1800 to 1810 it was the capital of the State. Population in 1870, 8920.
