CHAUX DE FONDS, a town of Switzerland, in the canton of Neuch√¢tel, and ten miles N.W. of the city of that name, at a height of 3200 feet above the level of the sea, in the rugged and narrow valley of the Jura. Rebuilt after the conflagration of 1794, the town has a handsome and pleasant appearance, and its public buildings include a church with vaulted roof, extensive schools, and a theatre. There are also some peculiar subterranean mills turned by a stream before it sinks into the ground. The principal trade is the manufacture of watches, which are turned out at the rate of 150,000 annually; but gilding, enamelling, and carving are also carried on, as well as the manufacture of scientific and musical instruments. The watch trade was introduced in 1679, and is conducted on the principle of the division of labour. Population in 1872, 19,930.
