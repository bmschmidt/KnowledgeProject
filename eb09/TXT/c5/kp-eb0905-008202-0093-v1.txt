CARAMAN, or Karaman, a town of Asiatic Turkey, in the vilayet of Konia in Asia Minor, 61 miles south-east of the city of Konia (Iccmium) on the border of an extensive plain at the foot of Mount Taurus, in 37° 13' N. lat. and 33° 28' E. long. It now contains about 1000 houses, three or four mosques, and an American church, and among other traces of its former importance are the ruins of a castle, the outer wall of which is of compass enough to contain about 100 houses. It trades with Smyrna and the other towns of Asia Minor, and manufactures coarse cloth from the wool of the neighbouring highlands. By the Greeks it is still called by its ancient name of Laranda, which was changed by the Turks for its present designation in honour of Karaman, the founder of the Kara-manian kingdom. Little is known of its ancient history except that it was destroyed by Perdiccas about 322 b.c., and afterwards became a seat of Isaurian pirates. It was taken possession of by Frederick Barbarossa in 1190; in 1466 it was captured by Mahomet IL, and in 1486 by Bajazet II.
