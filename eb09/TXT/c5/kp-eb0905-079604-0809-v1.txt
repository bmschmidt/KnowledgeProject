CIUDAD REAL, the chief town formerly of La Mancha, and now of the province of Ciudad Real, in Spain, 97 miles south from Madrid, on a plain between the Jabalon and Guadiana. It was built and fortified by Alphonso the Wise in 1264, to check the progress of the Moors; and portions of the walls and towers remain. It has several fine churches, and a large hospital, founded by Cardinal Lorenzana. It is one of the least commercial of the larger towns of Spain, deriving most of its trade from agriculture and an annual fair which is of great importance for the sale of asses and mules. Population, 9000.
