CAUDINE FORKS (Furculae Caudinos), the name of an Italian valley, famous in Roman history on account of the disaster which there befell the Roman army during the second Samnite war, in 321 b.c. Livy describes the pass as an open space, grassy, and well-watered, completely surrounded by lofty and thickly-wooded mountains, except where a passage is afforded by two narrow gorges, situated opposite to one another (bk. ix. c. 2). It has been usually identified with the Vai d’Arpaja, which is on the high road between Beneventum and Capua; and confirmation is found in the facts that this valley was known as the Caudine, and that close by there existed a village called Furculae (now Forchia). But there is the almost conclusive objection that this valley does not answer to the above description (which is the only sufficient one which we possess), being surrounded by no mountains of any elevation, and having many outlets. A much more probable theory is that which declares it to be the little valley between Sta Agata and Moirano, through which flows the small stream of the Isclero; and which, as it meets the Vai d’Arpaja near Caudium, would have an equal right to the name of Caudine FtJrks.
