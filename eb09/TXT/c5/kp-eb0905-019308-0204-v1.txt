CASTELLO, Giovanni Battista (1500-1569), an eminent Italian historical painter, was born in Bergamo, and is hence ordinarily termed II Bergamasco. He belongs, however, to the school of Genoa, but does not appear to have had any family relationship with the other two painters named Castello, also noticed here. He was employed to decorate the Nunziata di Portoria in Genoa, the saloon of the Lanzi Palace at Gorlago, and the Pardo Palace in Spain. His best-known works are the Martyrdom of St Sebastian, and the picture of our Saviour as Judge of the World on one of the vaultings of the Nunziata. He was an architect and sculptor as well as painter. In 1567 he was invited to Madrid by Philip IL, and there he died, holding the office of architect of the Royal Palaces.
