CHALONER, Sir Thomas (1515-1565), a statesman and poet, of a noble Welsh family, was born in 1515. Under Henry VIII. he was sent as ambassador to Charles V., whom he accompanied on his unfortunate expedition against Algiers in 1541. On his return he was appointed to the office of first clerk of the council. He gained the friendship of the duke of Somerset; but after his fall he was obliged to live in retirement, and during the reign of Mary his Protestantism still kept him from the court. On the accession of Elizabeth he was received into high favour, and appointed ambassador, first to the Emperor Ferdinand I., and then to the court of Spain, where, however, he found himself so uncomfortable that after three years’ stay he obtained permission to return home in 1564. He died the following year. Chaloner enjoyed considerable reputation as a poet, and left Poetical Works, De Republixa Anglorum Instauranda, the Praise of Folie (from the Latin of Erasmus), In Lαudem Henrici Octavi Carmen Panegyricum, the Office of Servants (from the Latin of Cognatus), and some other small pieces.
