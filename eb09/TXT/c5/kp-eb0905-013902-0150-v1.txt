CARRON, a small village of Scotland, in the county of Stirling and parish of Larbert, on the right bank of the Carron River, about two miles north-east of Falkirk. It is of importance for its iron-works, which were started in 1760 by a chartered company, with a capital of £150,000. There are five blast-furnaces and thirty-five bloomary forges, and they give employment to upwards of 2000 individuals. The carronade, a short kind of cannon with a large chamber for the powder, is so called because it was first made in perfection at these works. The river, which falls into the Forth three miles E.N.E. of Falkirk, is interesting as at one time the boundary of the Roman empire on the northwest. In the neighbourhood, are the ruins of the ancient Camelon, and not far from the iron-works is the site of a now demolished monument of great antiquity known as Arthur’s Oven, or Oon. The population is about 2500.
