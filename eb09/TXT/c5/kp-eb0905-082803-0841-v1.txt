CLERMONT-L’HÉRAULT, or Clermont de Lodève, a town of France, in the department of Hérault, and about ten miles by rail south of Lodève, is built on the slope of a hill which is crowned by an ancient castle and skirted by the Ydromiel, a tributary of the Ergue or Lergue. It owes its importance to its woollen manufacture, which was introduced in 1678; and it also produces vinegar and vitriol, has quarries of building-stone, plaster, and lime, and deals in brandy, oil, cattle, and wool. Population in 1872, 5487.
