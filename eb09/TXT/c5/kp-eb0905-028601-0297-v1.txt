CEFALU, a seaport town on the north coast of Sicily, in the province of Palermo, and 39 miles E.S.E. of the town of that name, in 38° 0' N. lat. and 14° 4' E. long. The new town, founded by Roger I. of Sicily in 1131, is situated at the base of a steep promontory 1191 feet in height, which overlooks the magnificent Bay of Cefalu. The houses are tolerably well built; and the cathedral, commenced in 1132, is distinguished for the beauty of its façade, with antique pillars and mosaics. Near it are the bishop’s palace and the seminary. The harbour is good, but small; and the trade, which is chiefly in oil, manna, and sardines, is inconsiderable. The inhabitants, who number about 10,200, are actively engaged in sea-fishery. The old town derived its name of Cephaloedium or Cephaloedis from the projecting headland mentioned above, on which it stood. On the original site are to be seen a fine Saracenic castle and an ancient temple. The latter is constructed of massive stones, and part of its walls is formed by the side of the hill. At first Cephaloedium was possibly only a fortress of the Himeraeans. In 396 b.c. it entered into friendly relations with Himilco; and after the defeat of the Carthaginian fleet, it was betrayed into the hands of Dionysius of Syracuse. In 307 b.c. it was taken by Agathocles, and in 254, in the first Punic war, by the Romans. In 858 a.d. the town was captured by the Saracens.
