QUEZALTENANGO, a city of Guatemala, capital of the province of its own name, lies on the Siguila in a fertile district about 25 or 30 miles to the west of Lake Atitlan, on the high road between the city of Guatemala and the Mexican province of Chiapas. It has a cathedral and other public buildings, carries on the manufacture of cotton and wool, and contains from 20,000 to 30,000 inhabitants, mostly Indians. In the days of the Quich√© power Quezaltenango, or, as it was then called, Xelahuh, was one of the largest and most flourishing cities in the country. The Spanish city was founded by Alvarado in 1524.
