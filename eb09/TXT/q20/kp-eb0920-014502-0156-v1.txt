QUADRILATERAL, a military term applied to any combination of four fortresses mutually supporting each other, but especially to that of the four fortified towns of Mantua, Peschiera, Verona, and Legnago, the two former of which are situated on the Mincio and the two latter on the Adige. The real value of the Quadrilateral, which gave Austria such a firm hold on Lombardy, lay in the extraordinary natural strength of Mantua and in the readiness with which troops and supplies could be poured into Verona from the north.

See “The Quadrilateral,” in the Cornhill Magazine, 1862; and Professor Malfatti, H Quadrilatero, Milan, 1866.
