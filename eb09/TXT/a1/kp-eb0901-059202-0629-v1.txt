ALME, or Alm ai (from âlim, wise, learned), the name of a distinct class of singing girls in Egypt. To be received into it, according to Μ. Savary, it is necessary to have a good voice, to understand the language well, to know the rules of poetry, and be able to compose and sing impromptu couplets adapted to the circumstances. The almai are present at all festivals and entertainments, and also at funerals, where they act the part of hired mourners. They are to be distinguished from the ghawazee, or dancing girls, who perform in the public streets, and are of a lower order.
