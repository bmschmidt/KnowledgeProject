AFANASIEF, Aleksandr Nikolaevich, a Russian scholar, distinguished for his researches in Slavonic literature and archaeology, was born about 1825. He contributed many valuable articles to the serial literature of his country, but his reputation rests chiefly on two works of more permanent interest. The first was an extensive collection, in eight parts, of Russian Popular Stories; the other a treatise, in three volumes, on the Poetical Views of the Old Slavonians about Nature, completed just before the authorâ€™s death, which occurred in the autumn of 1871.
