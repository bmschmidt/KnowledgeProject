ALVAREZ, Don José, the foremost Spanish sculptor of modern times, was born at Priego, in the province of Cordova, in 1768, and died at Madrid in 1827. Bred to his father’s trade of a stone-mason, he devoted all his spare time to drawing and modelling. In his twentieth year he became a pupil of the Academy of Granada. A work he executed soon afterwards for a fountain in his native town attracted the notice of the Bishop of Cordova, who took the young artist into his house and maintained him for several years. In 1799 he obtained from Charles IV. a pension of 12,000 reals, to enable him to visit Paris and Rome. In the former city he executed, in 1804, a statue of Ganymede, which placed him at once in the front rank of sculptors. Shortly afterwards his pension was more than doubled, and he left Paris for Rome, where he remained till within a year of his death. The most important of his numerous works, executed during this period, was a group representing Antilochus and Memnon, which was commissioned in marble (1818) by Ferdinand VII., and secured for the artist the appointment of court sculptor. It is now in the Museum of Madrid. Alvarez modelled a few portrait busts (Ferdinand VII., Rossini, the Duchess of Alba), which are remarkable for their vigour and fidelity.
