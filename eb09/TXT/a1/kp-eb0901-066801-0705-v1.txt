AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAYE, Abraham Nicolas, historian and publicist, was born at Orleans in February 1634, and died at Paris 8th December 1706. Little is known of his personal history beyond the fact that he was secretary to an embassy from the French court to the republic of Venice. At a later period he was imprisoned in the Bastile by order of Louis XIV. In 1676 he published at Amsterdam his Histoire du Gouvernement de Venise, in three volumes. Under the assumed name of De la Mothe Josseval, he published in 1683 a translation of Fra Paolo Sarpi’s History of the Council of Trent. This work, and especially certain notes added by the translator, gave great offence to the advocates of the unlimited authority of the pope, and three separate memorials were presented to have it repressed. Amelot also published translations of Machiavel’s Prince, and of the Annals of Tacitus, besides several other works.
