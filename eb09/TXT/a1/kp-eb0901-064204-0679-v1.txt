ALTEN OETTING, or Altoetting, a small market town in Upper Bavaria, situated on the MÃ¶rn, not far from its junction with the Inn. It has long been famous as a place of pilgrimage to which Roman Catholics resort in very large numbers, especially from Austria, Bavaria, and Swabia, on account of a celebrated image of the Virgin Mary in one of the churches. Another church contains the tomb of Tilly. Population, 1500.
