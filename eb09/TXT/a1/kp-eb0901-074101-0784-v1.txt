AMMON, Christoph Friedrich von, a distinguished theological writer and preacher, was born at Baireuth in January 1766, studied at Erlangen, held various professorships in the philosophical and theological faculties of Erlangen and Göttingen, succeeded Reinhard in 1813 as court preacher and counsellor at Dresden, retired from these offices in 1849, and died May 21, 1850. He sought to establish for himself a middle position between rationalism and supernaturalism, inclining, however, decidedly to the former. He declared for a “rational supernaturalism,” and contended that there must be a gradual development of Christian doctrine corresponding to the advance of knowledge and science. He was a man of great versatility and extensive learning, and a very voluminous author, his principal work being the Fortbildung des Christenthums zur Weltreligion, in 4 vols. (Leipsic, 1833-40). Entwurf einer rein biblischen Theologie appeared in 1792 (second edition, 1801), and Summa Theologica in 1803 (other editions, 1808, 1816, 1830). Von Ammon’s style in preaching was terse and lively, and some of his discourses are regarded as models of pulpit treatment of political questions.
