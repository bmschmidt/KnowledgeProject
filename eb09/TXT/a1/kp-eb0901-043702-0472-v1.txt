AK-SU, a town of Chinese Turkestan, is situated in 41° 7' N. lat., 79° E. long., 250 miles N.E. of Yarkand. It has a flourishing trade, and is resorted to for purposes of commerce by caravans from all parts of Central Asia. There are some cotton manufactures; and the place is celebrated for its richly-ornamented saddlery made from deer-skin. A Chinese garrison is stationed here, and copper and iron are wrought in the neighbourhood by exiled Chinese criminals. The district is well cultivated, and sheep and cattle are extensively reared. The population of the town is about 20,000; that of the town and district 100,000.
