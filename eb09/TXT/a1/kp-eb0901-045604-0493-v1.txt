ALBUMAZAR (Abu-Maaschar), a celebrated Arabian astronomer, born at Balkh, in Turkestan, in 805 a.d., died at Wasid in 885. He had reached the age of forty-seven before he entered on the studies to which he owes his fame. His principal works are An Introduction to Astronomy and the Book of Conjunction, both published in a Latin translation at Augsburg in 1489, and again at Venice in 1515. A work On the Revolution of the Years is also attributed to him, in which it is maintained that the world was created when the seven planets were in conjunction in the first degree of Aries, and that it will come to an end at a like conjunction in the last degree of Pisces.
