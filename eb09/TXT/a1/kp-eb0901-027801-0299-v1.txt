AGATHARCHIDES, a celebrated Greek grammarian and geographer who flourished about 140 years B.c., was bom at Cnidos. His works are lost, except those passages quoted by Diodorus Siculus and other authors, in which he describes the gold mines of Upper Egypt, and gives the first philosophical explanation of the inundations of the Nile, which he ascribed to the rains on the mountains of Ethiopia. (Hudsonâ€™s Greek Geographers.)
