ACANTHUS, a genus of plants belonging to the natural order Acanthaceae. The species are natives of the southern parts of Europe. The most common species is the Acanthus mollis or Brankursine. It has large, deeply-cut, hairy, shining leaves, which are supposed to have suggested the decoration of the Corinthian column. Another species, Acanthus spinosus, is so called from its spiny leaves.
