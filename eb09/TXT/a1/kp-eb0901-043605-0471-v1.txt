AKHISSAR, the ancient Thyatira, a town of Turkey in Asia, in Anatolia, 58 miles N.E. of Smyrna. The inhabitants are Greeks, Armenians, and Turks. The houses are built of earth or turf dried in the sun, and are very low and ill-constructed; but there are six or seven mosques, which are all of marble. Remarkable inscriptions are to be seen in several parts of the town on portions of the ruins of the ancient city. Cotton of excellent quality is grown in the neighbourhood, and the place is celebrated for its scarlet dyes. Population, about 6000.
