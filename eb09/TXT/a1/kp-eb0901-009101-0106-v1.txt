ACCORDION (from the French accord), a small musical instrument in the shape of a bellows, which produces sounds by the action of wind on metallic reeds of various sizes. It is played by being held in both hands and pulled backwards and forwards, the fingers being left free to touch the keys, which are ranged along each side. The instrument is akin to the concertina, but differs from it in having the chords fixed by a mechanical arrangement. It is manufactured chiefly in Paris.
