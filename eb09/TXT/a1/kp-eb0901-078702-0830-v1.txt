ANACHARSIS, a Scythian philosopher, who lived about 600 B.c. His father was one of the chiefs of his nation, and married a woman of Greece. Instructed in the Greek language by his mother, he prevailed upon the king to intrust him with an embassy to Athens. On his arrival in that renowned city he became acquainted with Solon, from whom he rapidly acquired a knowledge of the wisdom and learning of Greece. By the influence of Solon he was introduced to the principal persons in Athens, and was the first stranger who received the privileges of citizenship. After he had resided several years at Athens, he travelled through different countries in quest of knowledge, and then returned home filled with the desire of instructing his countrymen in the laws and the religion of the Greeks. According to Herodotus, he was killed by his brother Saulius while he was performing sacrifice to the goddess Cybele. His simple and forcible mode of expressing himself gave birth to the proverbial expression, “Scythian eloquence.” (Herodot. iv. 76; Lucian, Scytha.'')
