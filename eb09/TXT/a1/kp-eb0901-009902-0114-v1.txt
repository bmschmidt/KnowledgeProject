ACOSTA, Christoval d', a Portuguese naturalist, born at Mozambique in the early part of the 16th century. On a voyage to Asia he was taken captive by pirates, who exacted from him a very large ransom. After spending some years in India, chiefly at Goa, a Portuguese colony, he returned home, and settled as a surgeon at Burgos. Here he published his Tratado de las drogas y medecinas de las Indias orientales (1578). This work was translated into Latin, Italian, and French, became well known throughout Europe, and is still consulted as an authority. Acosta also wrote an account of his travels, a book in praise of women, and other works. He died in 1580.
