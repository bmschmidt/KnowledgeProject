ALLIANCE, a league between independent states for the purpose of combined action, defensive or offensive, or bothâ€”a subject which falls to be treated under the heading Law of Nations. The alliances of greatest historical importance are the Triple Alliance (1688) of Great Britain, Sweden, and the Netherlands against France; the Grand Alliance (1689) of the Emperor Leopold I. and Holland, subsequently joined by England, Spain, and Saxony, against Louis XIV.; the Quadruple Alliance (1718) of Great Britain, France, Austria, and Holland, against Spain; the Holy Alliance (1815) of Russia, Austria, and Prussia, for the maintenance of peace and the establishment of the existing dynasties; and the alliance (1854) of Great Britain, France, and Turkey, against Russia.
