AMLWCH, a town of Anglesey, North Wales, situated on a rising ground on the north coast of the island, 15 miles from Beaumaris. It owes its importance almost entirely to the copper mines of the Parys Mountain; before [9:1:739] the discovery of the ore in 1768 it was a small hamlet of some six houses. At one time the mines produced 3000 tons of metal annually, but in recent years the quantity has greatly diminished. The harbour has been cut out of rock at considerable expense, and is protected by a breakwater. A branch of the Chester and Holyhead Railway terminates in the town. Amlwch, which is associated with Beaumaris, Holyhead, and Llangefni, in returning one member to parliament, had a population of 2968 in 1871.
