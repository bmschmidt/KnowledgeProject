ALLIX, Pierre, a distinguished divine of the French Reformed Church, was bom at Alen√ßon in 1641. He was pastor first at St Agobile in Champagne, and then at Charenton, near Paris. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 compelled him to take refuge in London, where, under the sanction of James II., he opened a church for the French exiles. His reputation for learning was such as to obtain for him, soon after his arrival, the degree of doctor of divinity from both universities, and in 1690 he received from Bishop Burnet the more substantial honour of the treasurership and a canonry in Salisbury cathedral He died at London in March 1717.

The works of Allix, which are very numerous, are chiefly of a controversial and apologetic character, and, like most works of that class, are not thoroughly trustworthy. At the invitation of a number of English ministers, he is said to have written a history of the councils of the church, which, however, owing to want of support, never was published. In opposition to Bossuet he issued Some Remarks upon the Ecclesiastical History of the Ancient Churches of Piedmont (1690), and Remarks upon the Ecclesiastical History of the Ancient Churches of the Albigenses (1692), with the view of showing that the Albigenses were not Manichaeans, but historically identical with the Wal-denses. His Dissertation on the First Rise of the Trisagium or Doxology (1674), and Reflections upon the Books of Holy Scripture (1688), are of little present value.
