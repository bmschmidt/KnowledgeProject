ALBANIA, in Ancient Geography, a country of Asia, bounded, according to Strabo, on the W. by Iberia, on the E. by the Caspian Sea, on the N. by Sarmatia, on the S. by Armenia and the river Cyrus (Kour). The country formerly called Albania corresponds with the modern Daghistan, Schirvan, and Leghistan, and is extremely fertile, owing to the alluvial deposits made by the river Cyrus. The ancient historians describe the Albanians as tall, strong-bodied, and, generally speaking, of a very graceful appearance. The Albanians were originally a nomad race, and never devoted themselves to agriculture or commerce. They became known to the Romans during Pompeyâ€™s expedition in pursuit of Mithridates (65 B.c.), against which they opposed a force of 60,000 infantry and 22,000 cavalry. Though Pompey exacted from them a nominal submission, they continued practically independent.
