ADMIRALTY ISLAND, an island belonging to the United States, about 90 miles long from N. to S., and 25 miles broad, lying between King George III. Archipelago and the mainland, in 58° N. lat., 134° W. long. Its coasts, which are generally steep and rocky, are indented with several accessible and commodious bays. The island has abundance of good water, and is covered with pines, which grow there to a very large size.
