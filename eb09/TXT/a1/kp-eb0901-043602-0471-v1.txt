AKERMAN (perhaps the ancient Tyras or Julia Alba), a town of Russia in Europe, in the province of Bessarabia, on a tongue of land projecting into the estuary of the Dniester. Its harbour is too shallow to admit vessels of large size; but the trade of the town is, notwithstanding, very considerable. Large quantities of salt are obtained from the saline lakes in the neighbourhood; and com, wine, wool, and leather are among the other exports. The town, which is ill-built, contains several mosques and Greek and Armenian churches; it is guarded by ramparts, and is commanded by a citadel placed on an eminence. Akerman derives some historical celebrity from the treaty concluded there in 1826 between Russia and the Porte, securing considerable advantages to the former. It was the non-observance of this treaty by Turkey that led to the war of 1828. Population (1867), 29,609.
