ABEL, Karl Friedrich (1726-1787), a celebrated German musician. His adagio compositions have been highly praised, but he attained greater distinction as a performer than as a composer, his instrument being the Viola di gamba, which from his time has given place to the violoncello. He studied under Sebastian Bach, played for ten years (1748-58) in the band formed at Dresden by the Elector of Saxony, under Hasse, and then, proceeding to England, became (1759) chamber-musician to the queen of George III. His life was shortened by habits of intemperance.
