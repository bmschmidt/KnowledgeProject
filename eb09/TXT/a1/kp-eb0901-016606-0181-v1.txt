ADULLAM, in Scripture Geography, a city in the plain country of the tribe of Judah. The cave Adullam, in which David took refuge after escaping from Gath (1 Sam. xxii. 1), was probably situated among the mountains to the east of Judah, near the Dead Sea. From its being described as the resort of “every one that was in distress,” or “in debt,” or “discontented,” it has often been humorously alluded to, as by the Baron of Bradwardine in Waverley, chap. 57.
