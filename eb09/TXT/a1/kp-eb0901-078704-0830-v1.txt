ANACOLUTHON is the lack of grammatical symmetry in a sentence, either through the consequent taking an unexpected form or being altogether suppressed, the writer or speaker desiring to present his thought in another aspect, or feeling that he has already made his meaning sufficiently plain. In the case of a man who is full of his subject, or who is carried along by the passion of the moment, such inconséquents are very apt to occur. Of Niebuhr it is told that his oral lectures consisted almost entirely of anacoluthic constructions. To this kind of licence some languages, as Greek and English, readily lend themselves; while the grammatical rigidity of others, as Latin and French admits of it but sparingly. In Herodotus[9:1:788], Thucydides, Aeschylus, Pindar, and Plato, abundant epecimens are to be found; and the same is true of the writers of the Elizabethan age in our own language. The following is an example :—“And he charged him to tell no man; but go show thyself’ 1 &c. (Luke v. 14).
