ALKMAAR, Heinrik von, the German translator of the celebrated satirical poem Reineke de Vos, flourished in the latter half of the 15th century. In the preface to his work, which is the only source of information as to his life, he states that he was tutor to the Duke of Lorraine, and that he translated the poem from the Walsch. In spite of the latter statement, many have attributed the authorship to him; but it is now known that the story had a much earlier origin. Some have supposed the name Alkmaar to be a pseudonym.
