ACROLITH (ακ ρό λι0 θ oι ), statues of a transition period in the history of plastic art, in which the trunk of the figure was of wood, and the head, hands, and feet of marble. The wood was concealed either by gilding or, more commonly, by drapery, and the marble parts alone were exposed. Acroliths are frequently mentioned by Pausanias, the best known specimen being the Minerva Areia of the Plataeans.
