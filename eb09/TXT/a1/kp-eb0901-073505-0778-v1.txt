AMES, Joseph, author of a valuable work on the progress of printing in England, called Typographical Antiquities (1749), which is often quoted by bibliographers. He was bom in 1689, and died in 1759. The best editions of his work are those published with the additions of Herbert (1785-90), and of Dibdin (1810-16). These both include a life of Ames written by Mr Gough.
