ALBUFERA DE VALENCIA, a lagoon, 7 miles south of Valencia in Spain, about 12 miles in length and 4 in breadth, 12 feet being its greatest depth. It communicates with the sea by a narrow outlet, which can be opened or closed at pleasure. The lake is crown property, and is of great value from the fish and wild fowl with which it abounds. In 1812 Marshal Suchet was created duke of Albufera by Napoleon for his conquest of Valencia, and invested with the domain; but the battle of Vitoria soon deprived him of his possession, though he still retained the title. Subsequently the revenues of Albufera were conferred upon the Duke of Wellington, in token of the gratitude of the Spanish nation.
