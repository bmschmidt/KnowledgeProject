AJURUOCA, a town of Brazil, in the province of Minas Geraes, 117 miles N. of Rio de Janeiro. It is situated on the Ajuruoca river, which is here crossed by a bridge. Gold was once found in the vicinity, but the soil has been long exhausted of the precious metals; and the people are chiefly engaged in agriculture, and in rearing animals for the markets of Rio. The land is fertile, and produces millet, mandioca, coffee, sugar-cane, and tobacco. The population of the town and district is 12,000.
