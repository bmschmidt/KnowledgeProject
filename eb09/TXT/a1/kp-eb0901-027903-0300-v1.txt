AGEN, the chief town of the department of Lot-et-Garonne in France, is situated on the right bank of the Garonne, 73 miles S.E. of Bordeaux. Through its excellent water communication it affords an outlet for the-agricultural[9:1:280] produce of the district, and forms an entrepot of trade between Bordeaux and Toulouse. Its chief manufactures are sail-cloth, cotton, linen, leather, and starch. It has a college and several literary institutions, and is the seat of a bishop and a high court of justice. There is a fine bridge of eleven arches over the Garonne. In 1872 the population was 18,887.
