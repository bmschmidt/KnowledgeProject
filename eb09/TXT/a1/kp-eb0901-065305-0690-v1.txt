AMATI, the name of a family of violin-makers who flourished at Cremona from about 1550 to 1692. According to FÃ©tis, Andrea and Nicolo Amati, two brothers, were the first Italians who made violins. They were succeeded by Antonio and Geronimo, sons of Nicolo. Another Nicolo, son of Geronimo, was alive in 1692. The violins made by this family are distinguished by their small size, exquisite finish, and the mathematical proportion of the parts. Their tone is soft and sweet, but deficient in intensity, owing to the flatness of their model. Stradivari was a pupil of the Amatis.
