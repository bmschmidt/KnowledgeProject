ALGHERO, a seaport of Italy, in the province of Sassari, Sardinia, situated on the west coast of the island, 14 miles S.W. of Sassari. It was founded by the Genoese, and was afterwards taken by the Catalonians, whose language is still spoken. Though strongly fortified towards the sea, the landward side of the town is commanded by the overhanging hills. Alghero is an episcopal see, and has a cathedral, erected in 1517, several monasteries, convents, and public schools. Many of the houses are of antique architecture. Near the town are some fine stalactite grottoes. The neighbourhood produces oil and fruit, and the best wine of the island; and the corals of Alghero are the most beautiful found in the Mediterranean.

The other exports include grain, wool, tobacco, bones, skins, and anchovies. Porte Conte, 9 miles to the N.W., is the roadstead frequented by the largest vessels, and is a secure and fortified anchorage, capable of accommodating a large fleet. Population of commune (1865), 8419.
