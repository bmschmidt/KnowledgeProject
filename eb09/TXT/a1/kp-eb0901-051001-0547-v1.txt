ALGAU, or Allgau, the name now given to a comparatively small district forming the south-western corner of Bavaria, and belonging to the province of Swabia and Neuburg, but formerly applied to a much larger territory, which extended as far as the Danube on the north, the Inn on the south, and the Lech on the west. The Algau Alps contain several lofty peaks, the highest of which is MÃ¤dele-Gabel, 8611 feet above the sea. The district is celebrated for the cattle, milk, butter, and cheese that it produces.
