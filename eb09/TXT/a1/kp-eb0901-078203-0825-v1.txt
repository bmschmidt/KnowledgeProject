AMWELL, a village of Hertfordshire, in the parish of Great Amwell, on a hill overlooking the Lea, 3 miles from Hertford and 20 from London. Near it are the sources of the New River, formed between 1606 and 1612 in order to supply London with water; and on a small island in the stream there is a monument to Sir Hugh Myddleton, through whose exertions this work was carried out. Haileybury college, formerly the property of the East India Company, is also in this parish, which has a population of 2245.
