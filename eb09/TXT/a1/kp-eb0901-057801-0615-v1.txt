ALKALI, a term originally applied to the ashes of plants, now employed in inorganic chemistry as a generic name given to the group of compounds that have the property of neutralising acids. The use of the term is, however, generally confined to such members of the group as are soluble in water. The most soluble alkaline bodies are the oxides of potassium (potash), sodium (soda), lithium (lithia), and ammonium (aqueous ammonia); and next in order the oxides of calcium (lime), barium (baryta), and strontium (strontia). The solutions of these bodies exert a caustic or corrosive action on vegetable and animal substances, and precipitate the oxides of the heavy metals from solutions of their salts. Many vegetable colouring matters are changed in tint by alkaline solutionsâ€”for instance, reddened litmus becomes blue, yellow turmeric brown, and syrup of violets and infusions of red cabbage green.
