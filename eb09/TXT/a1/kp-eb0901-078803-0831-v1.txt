ANADYOMENE (’ Ava8υoμAvη), an epithet of Aphrodite (Venus), expressive of her having risen (i.e., been born) from the foam of the sea. In works of ancient art—e.y., in many existing bronze ata⅛uette⅛~Vonus was represented [9:1:789] under this title as if just emerged from the sea, and in the act of wringing her tresses. This was the subject of a painting by Apelles, one of the most celebrated pictures of antiquity, the conception having been, it was said, suggested to him by seeing Phryne bathing. This painting belonged first to the people of Cos, from whom it was taken to Rome by Augustus in part payment of tribute levied by him. By the time of Nero it had become almost entirely ruined by decay.
