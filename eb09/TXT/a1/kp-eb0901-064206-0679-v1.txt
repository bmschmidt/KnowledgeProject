ALTIN, a lake of Siberia, which gives rise to the Bija, one of the head streams of the Obi, is situated among the Altai mountains, 320 miles south of the city of Tomsk. It is about 80 miles long, and its greatest breadth is about 50 miles; but the large quantities of melted snow which flow down from the surrounding mountains make it larger in summer than in winter. It is remarkable that in winter the northern part is frozen so hard as to be passable on sledges, while the southern is never covered with ice.
