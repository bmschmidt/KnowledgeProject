ALAMOS DE BARRIENTOS, Don Balthazar, a Spanish philologist, born at Medina del Campo, in Castile, about 1550. He was on terms of intimate friendship with Antonio Perez, secretary to Philip II.; and when the latter fell into disgrace, Alamos was cast into prison, where he remained nearly twelve years. During this period he prepared the translation of Tacitus, with a commentary, which gave him his reputation as a classical scholar. On the death of Philip II. Alamos recovered his liberty, and afterwards received various important court appointments through the influence of the Duke de Lerma and the Count dâ€™Olivarez. He died at the age of eighty-five.
