He studied at New Jersey, devoting himself specially to Hebrew and other Oriental languages. He graduated in 1826, and from 1830 to 1833 was adjunct professor of ancient languages and literature in his alma mater. In 1838 he was appointed professor of biblical criticism and ecclesiastical history in the theological seminary at Princeton. He was transferred in 1852 to the chair of biblical and ecclesiastical history, which he occupied till his death in January 1860. Dr Alexander wrote several valuable works in his own department, the most important being a Translation of and Commentary on the Psalms, a Critical Commentary on the Prophecies of Isaiah, and a treatise on primitive church government. He also contributed numerous articles to the Biblical Repertory and the Princeton Review. At the time of his death he was engaged along with Dr Hodge in the preparation of a commentary on the New Testament.
