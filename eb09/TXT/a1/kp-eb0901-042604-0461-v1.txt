AINMULLER, Maximilian Emmanuel, founder of a new school of glass - painting, was born at Munich on the 14th February 1807. He was induced, by the advice of Gartner, director of the royal porcelain manufactory, to devote himself to the study of glass-painting, both as a mechanical process and as an art, and he made such progress that in 1828 he was appointed director of the newly-founded royal painted-glass manufactory at Munich. The method which he gradually perfected there was a development of the enamel process adopted in the Renaissance, and consisted in actually painting the design upon the glass, which was subjected, as each colour was laid on, to carefully-adjusted heating. The fault of this new style is its production of transparent pictures seen by transmitted and not by reflected light; but the popular verdict in its favour has been, notwithstanding, proved by the extent to which it has been adopted. The earliest specimens of Ainmüller's work are to be found in the cathedral of Ratisbon. With a few exceptions, all the windows in Glasgow cathedral are from his hand. Specimens may also be seen in St Paul’s cathedral and St Peter’s College, Cambridge. On the Continent it must suffice to mention Cologne cathedral as containing some of his finest productions. Ainmüller had considerable skill as an oilpainter, especially in interiors; and his pictures of the Chapel Royal at Windsor and of Westminster Abbey have been much admired. He died 9th December 1870.
