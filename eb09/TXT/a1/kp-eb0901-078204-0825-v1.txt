AMYMONE (Ά/χυ/ιώη?), in Greek Legend, a daughter of Danaüs, by whom, with her sisters, she had been sent to look for water, the district of Argus being then parched through the anger of Neptune. Amymone having thrown her spear at a stag, missed it, but hit a satyr asleep in the brake. The satyr pursued her, and she called on Neptune for help, who appeared, and for love of her beauty caused a spring to well up, which received her name. By Neptune she became the mother of Nauplius, the wrecker. Amymone at the spring is represented on ancient engraved géms.
