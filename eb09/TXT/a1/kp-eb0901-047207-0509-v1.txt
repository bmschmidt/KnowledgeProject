ALDER, a genus of plants (Alnus) belonging to the order Betulaceoe, the best known of which is the common alder (A. glutinosa). This tree thrives best in moist soils, has a shrubby appearance, and grows, under favourable circumstances, to a height of 40 or 50 feet. Under water the wood is very durable, and it is therefore used for piles. The supports of the Rialto at Venice, and many buildings at Amsterdam, are of alder-wood. Furniture is sometimes made from the wood, and it supplies excellent charcoal for gunpowder. The bark is astringent; it is used as a gargle, and also in tanning and dyeing.
