ABYDOS (2.), in Ancient Geography, a town of Upper Egypt, a little to the west of the Nile, between Ptolemais and Diospolis Parva, famous for the palace of Memnon and the temple of Osiris. Remains of these two edifices are still in existence. In the temple of Osiris Mr Bankes discovered in 1818 the tablet of Abydos, containing a double series of twenty-six shields of the predecessors of Rameses the Great. This tablet is now deposited in the British Museum.
