ALCALA LA REAL, a town of the province of Jaen in Spain, 18 miles S.W. of the town of that name. It stands on a declivity between two mountain ridges, at an elevation of about 3000 feet above the sea. It possesses a fine abbey. Its distinctive name la Real, the Royal, is derived from its capture in 1340 by Alphonso XI. of Leon, in person. In 1810 the Spaniards were defeated here by the French under Sebastiani. Some trade is carried on at the place in wine and wool. Population, 11,521.
