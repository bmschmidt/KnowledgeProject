ALEXANDER of Tralles (Alexander Trallianus), a medical writer, was a native of Tralles, a city of Lydia, and lived probably about the middle of the 6th century. He is the author of a work, divided into twelve books, in which he treats of bodily distempers. He was the first to open the jugular vein, and to use cantharides as a blister for the gout. Dr Freind, in his History of Physic, styles him one of the most valuable authors since the time of Hippocrates.

See also Dr Milwardâ€™s Trallianus Reviviscens; or, An Account of Alexander Trallian, one of the Greek Writers that flourished after Galen, being a Supplement to Dr Freind's History of Physic, London, 1734, 8vo. The Greek text of his principal work was first published by Jac. Goupylus, Lutet. 1548, fol. It was reprinted, and was then accompanied with a Latin version by Jo. Guinterius, Basil, 1556, 8vo. He is likewise the author of an epistle on worms, De Lumbricis, which was published, in Greek and Latin, by Mercurialis, in his Vari ae Lectiones, Venet. 1570, 4to.
