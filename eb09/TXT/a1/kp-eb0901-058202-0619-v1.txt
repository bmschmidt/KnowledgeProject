ALLEN, Bog of, the name given to a congeries of morasses in Kildare and Kingâ€™s County, Ireland. Clane Bog, the eastern extremity, is within 17 miles of Dublin, and the morasses extend westward almost to the Shannon. Their total area is about 238,500 acres. They do not form one continuous bog, the tract of the country to which the name is given being intersected by strips of dry cultivated land. The rivers Brosna, Barrow, and Boyne take their rise in these morasses; and the Grand Canal crosses them. The Bog of Allen has a general elevation of 250 feet above the level of the sea, and the average thickness of the peat of which it consists is 25 feet. It rests on a subsoil of clay and marl [9:1:583]
