ALARCON, Hernando de, a Spanish navigator of the 16th century, known only in connection with the expedition to the coast of California, of which he was leader. He set sail on the 9th May 1540, with orders from the Spanish court to await at a certain point on the coast the arrival of an expedition by land under the command of Vasquez de Coronado. The junction was not effected, though Alarcon reached the appointed place and left letters, which were afterwards found by Diaz, another explorer. Alarcon was the first to determine with certainty that California was a peninsula and not an island, as had been supposed. He made a careful and exact survey of the coast, sailed a considerable distance up the Rio del Tizon (Colorado), and was thus able, on his return to New Spain in 1541, to construct a map of California, which, according to M. Duflot de Mofras, scarcely differs from one of the present day.
