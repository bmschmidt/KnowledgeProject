AL-KINDI, Abu Yusuf, &c., styled by pre-eminence “The Philosopher of the Arabs,” flourished during the first half of the 10th century, and died at some unknown date posterior to 961. His literary activity was encyclopaedic, and spread itself over all the sciences. The titles of his works number nearly 200 in the catalogue of Casiri, and amount to 265 in that of Flügel; but the latter appears in some cases to have enumerated the same works under two divisions, and it is doubtful whether the philosopher has not been confounded with another writer of the same name. His treatises are arranged under the following heads, which throw some light on his classification of the sciences :—Philosophy in general, logic, politics, ethics, arithmetic (under which he discusses the unity of God), spherology, theory of music (which was closely connected with all primitive speculation from its religious character), astronomy, meteorology, geometry, cosmology (the form, &c., of the heavens), astrology, medicine, and on various arts, besides his commentaries and controversial writings. Of all these, none except some treatises on medicine and astrology remain. Others of them must have been known in the Middle Ages, for Al-Kindi is placed by Roger Bacon, along with Alhazen, in the first rank after Ptolemy as a writer on perspective (optics). Some of them were certainly translated by Gerard of Cremona. Whatever his influence may have been on the Schoolmen, he was undoubtedly a great initiator as regards his countrymen. He was one of the earliest translators and commentators of Aristotle, but he appears to have been, like Al-Farabi, superseded by Avicenna. He marks the first philosophic revolt against Islamism, and his doctrine on the simplicity and unity of the Deity was apparently equally Aristotelian and un-Mahometan. See Flügel, Abhandlungen für die Kunde des Margenlandes, erster Band, 1859.)
