ABGAR, the name or title of a line of kings of Edessa in Mesopotamia. One of them is known from a correspondence he is said to have had with Jesus Christ. The letter of Abgar, entreating Jesus to visit him and heal him of a disease, and offering Him an asylum from the wrath of the Jews, and the answer of Jesus promising to send a disciple to heal Abgar after His ascension, are given by Eusebius, who believed the documents to be genuine. The same belief has been held by a few modems, but there can be no doubt whatever that the letter of Jesus at least is apocryphal. It has also been alleged that Abgar possessed a picture of Jesus, which the credulous may see either at Rome or at Genoa. Some make him the possessor of the handkerchief a woman gave Jesus, as He bore the cross, to wipe the sweat from His face with, on which, it is fabled, His features remained miraculously imprinted.
