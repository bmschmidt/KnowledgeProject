AMOL, or Amul, a town of Persia, in the province of Mazanderan, about 12 miles above the mouth of theHeraz, a river which flows into the Caspian Sea. It is not walled, and is now a placo of no great importance, but in and around it thero are ruins and ancient buildings which bear witness to its former greatness. Of these the most conspicuous is the magnificent mausoleum of Seyed Quam-u-deen, king of Sari and Amol, who died in 1378. At Amol there is a bridge of twelve arches over the Heraz, and the bazaars of the town are large and well supplied. The population is about 40,000, but a great number of these leave the city in summer to tend their flocks.
