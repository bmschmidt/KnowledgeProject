ALCAMENES ('Αλ κα μέnη ς ), a famous Athenian sculptor, a pupil of Phidias, who is celebrated for his skill in art by Cicero, Pliny, Pausanias, Lucan, &c. He flourished from about 448 to 400 B.c., and appears as one of the great triumvirate of Greek sculptors, Phidias, Alcamenes, and Polycletus. He is said to have once competed with his master, the subject being a statue of Minerva. In this attempt the style of Alcamenes was exquisite in finish, but he had overlooked the consideration that the statue was to be placed on a high column, and there his work would not bear comparison with that of his great master. His statue of Venus Urania, in the temple of that deity at Athens, was reckoned his masterpiece.
