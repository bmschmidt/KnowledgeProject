AMADEUS V., surnamed the Great, Count of Savoy, was born at Bourget in 1249, and succeeded his uncle Philip in 1285. The cautious prudence of Amadeus enabled him greatly to increase his territory by means of marriage, purchase, and donations. He gradually rose to such eminence among the European powers, that he was constituted their umpire to settle their differencesâ€”an office which he performed with much reputation to himself and advantage to them. In 1310 he was created a prince of the empire by Henry VII. When the Turks attempted to retake Rhodes from the knights of St John of Jerusalem, he acquired great renown by the valour with which he led an expedition to the relief of the island. A Maltese cross with the letters F.E.R.T. (Fortitudo ejus Ehodum tenuit), it is said, became the arms of Amadeus and his successors, in memory of this victory. Amadeus undertook a journey to Avignon to persuade Pope John XXII. to preach a crusade in favour of Andronicus. He died there in the year 1323.
