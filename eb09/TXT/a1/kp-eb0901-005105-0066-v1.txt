ABOMEY, the capital of Dahomey, in West Africa, is situated in N. lat. 7°, E. long. 2° 4', about 60 miles N. of Whydah, the port of the kingdom. It is a clay-built town, surrounded by a moat and mud walls, and occupies a large area, part of which is cultivated. The houses stand apart; there are no regular streets; and the place is very dirty. It has four larger market-places, and trade is carried on in palm-oil, ivory, and gold, Mohammedan traders from the interior resorting to its markets. The town contains the principal palace of the king of Dahomey. It is the scene of frequent human sacrifices, a “custom” being held annually, at which many criminals and captives are slain; while on the death of a king a “grand custom” is held, at which sometimes as many as 2000 victims have perished. The slave-trade is also prosecuted, and the efforts of the British Government to induce the king to abolish it and the “customs” have proved unsuccessful. Population, about 30,000. See Dahomey.
