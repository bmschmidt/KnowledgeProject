ALEXIS, an ancient comic poet, born about 394 b.c. at Thurii in Magna Graecia, the uncle and instructor of Menander. Plutarch says that he lived to the age of 106 years, and according to Suidas he wrote 245 plays, of which the titles of 113 are known. The fragments that have been preserved by Athenaeus and Stobaeus attest the wit and elegance of the author. The plays were frequently translated by the Latin comic writers. (See Meineke, Fragm. Com. Gr oe c. vol. i.)
