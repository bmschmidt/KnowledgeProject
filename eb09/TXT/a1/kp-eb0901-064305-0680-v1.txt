ALTRINGHAM, or Altrincham, a market town in the north of Cheshire, 8 miles south of Manchester, with which it is connected by railway. It is a neat, clean place, surrounded by villas of Manchester manufacturers, who are attracted by its healthy climate and pleasant situation. It has no parish church, but there is a chapel of ease belonging to the parish of Bowdon, in which it is situated, and also a Roman Catholic and several dissenting places of worship. Yarn, worsted, and cotton are the chief manufactures; and large quantities of fruit and vegetables are sent to the Manchester market. Population in 1871, 8478.
