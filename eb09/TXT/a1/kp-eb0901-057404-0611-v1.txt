ALICATA, or Licata, a seaport of Italy, in the province of Girgenti, Sicily, situated on the south coast, at the mouth of the Salso, the largest river in the island. It is supposed to occupy the site of the ancient Phintias, built by Phintias, tyrant of Agrigentum, in 280 b.c., after the destruction of Gela. The neighbourhood was the scene of many of the most memorable events of the Punic wars. On the hill overlooking the modern town there are extensive ancient remains. Alicata is now the most important commercial town on the south coast of Sicily, though the port is only an open shallow roadstead. The larger vessels lie a mile off shore, and are laden and discharged by means of barges. The chief trade is in sulphur, and the other exports include corn, fruit, macaroni, soda, and excellent wine. Population, 16,000.
