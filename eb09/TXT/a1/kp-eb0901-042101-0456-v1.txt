AHALA, a noble Roman family of the gens Servilia, which produced many distinguished men. Of these the most celebrated is C. Servilius Structus Ahala, master of the horse to the dictator Cincinnatus, b.c. 439. He signalised himself by his boldness in slaying in the forum with his own hand the popular agitator Sp. Maelius, for refusing to appear before the dictator on a charge of conspiracy against the state. For this act Ahala was brought to trial. He saved himself from condemnation by retiring into exile.
