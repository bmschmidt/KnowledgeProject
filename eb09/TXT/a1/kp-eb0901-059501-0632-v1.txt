ALMONDBURY, an extensive parish and township of Yorkshire in England, lying to the S.E. of Huddersfield. As the manufactures of Huddersfield have increased, various outlying districts have been built on, so that the parish of Almondbury now includes a considerable part of that important and flourishing town. The parish contains 28,092 acres. The town lies on the river Calder, 2 miles S.E. of Huddersfield, and had formerly a cathedral and a strong castle. By some writers it is supposed to occupy the site of the Roman Campodunum mentioned by Antoninus; but whether or not, the place can boast a Roman originâ€”it was at least a town of importance in Saxon times, and a seat of the kings of Northumbria. It has a free grammar school founded by James I., a good church, and several other public buildings. The inhabitants of the town and parish are chiefly engaged in the manufacture of fine cloths, and woollen, cotton, and silk goods. In 1871 the population of the parish was 46,299; of the township, 11,669.
