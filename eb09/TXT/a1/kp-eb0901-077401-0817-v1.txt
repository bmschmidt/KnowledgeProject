AMPHION, in Greek Mythology, the son of Zeus by Antiope, and the husband of Niobe, was a musician of such wonderful power, that at the sounds of his lyre the stones began to move, and formed themselves into walls around Thebes, after his conquest of that city. He was killed by Apollo for assaulting his temple; or, as some report, he destroyed himself in despair at the slaughter of his children by that god. The famous Farnese bull, discovered in 1546, represents Amphion punishing Dirce for her treatment of his mother. There are four other mythical personages of this name.
