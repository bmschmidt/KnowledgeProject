ACCRINGTON, an important manufacturing town of England, in Lancashire, lies on the banks of a stream called the Hindburn, in a deep valley, 19 miles N. from Manchester and 5 miles E. of Blackburn. It has increased rapidly in recent years, and is the centre of the Manchester cotton-printing trade. There are large cotton factories and printworks, besides bleach-fields, &c., employing many hands. Coal is extensively wrought in the neighbourhood. The town has a good appearance, and among the more handsome buildings are a fine church, in the Gothic style, erected in 1838, and the Peel Institution, an Italian structure, containing an assembly room, a lecture room, &c., The sanitary arrangements generally are good, and a reservoir capable of containing 140,000,000 gallons has been constructed for the water supply of the town. Accrington is a station on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. The population of the two townships of Old and New Accrington was in 1861, 17,688; and in 1871, 21,788.
