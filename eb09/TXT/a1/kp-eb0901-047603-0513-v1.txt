ALECONNER, an officer appointed yearly at the court-lect of ancient manors for the assize of ale and ale-measures. The gustatores cervisioe — called in different localities by the different names, “ale-tasters,” “ale-founders,” and “ale-conners ”—were sworn to examine beer and ale, to take care that they were good and wholesome and were sold at proper prices. In London, four ale-conners are still chosen annually by the liverymen in common hall assembled, on Midsummer Day. Since ale and beer have become excisable commodities the custom of appointing ale-tasters has in most places fallen into disuse. (For the means now employed to test the quality of ales, see Adulteration, p. 172.)
