AMALASONTHA, or Amalasuentha, daughter of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, was born about 498 a.d. In 515 she married Eutharic, the last representative of the Amali family, who died (524-5), leaving an only son, Athalaric. The latter was designated by his grandfather Theodoric as the heir to the throne, and Amala-sontha was appointed his guardian. On the death of Theodoric in 526, Amalasontha became regent, and endeavoured by a wise and vigorous administration to carry on the work of civilisation and enlightenment which her father had commenced. She devoted herself with special solicitude to the education of Athalaric, but her efforts were frustrated by the opposition of the Gothic nobles. Encouraged by them, the young heir to the throne threw off the restraints imposed by his mother, plunged into debauchery, and died at the age of sixteen (534). In the same year Amalasontha married her cousin Theodahadus, and made him co-regent with herself. A few months later (April 535) she was assassinated by order of her husband in an island on Lake Bolsena.
