ADMIRALTY ISLANDS, a group of about forty islands lying to the N.E. of New Guinea, between 2째 and 3째 S. lat., and 146째 18' and 147째 46' E. long. The largest is about 50 miles in length; the others are very small, and all rise but little above the sea-level. Their exuberant vegetation, and in particular the groves of cocoa-nut trees, give them a very beautiful appearance. The islands were discovered by the Dutch in 1616, but have seldom been visited, access being difficult on account of the surrounding reefs. The natives are tall, and of a tawny colour.
