AGUA, Volcano de, a huge mountain in Central America, 25 miles S.W. of Guatemala. It is of a conical shape, and rises to a height of 15,000 feet above the level of the sea. At the summit there is a crater, measuring about 140 yards by 120, from which stones and torrents of boiling water are occasionally discharged. In close proximity to Agua are the volcanoes of Pacaya, on the S.E., and Fuego on the W., and the three present together a scene of great magnificence.
