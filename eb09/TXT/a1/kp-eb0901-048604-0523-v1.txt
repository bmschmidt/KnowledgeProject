ALEXANDER BALAS (a surname that probably means “lord”), a man of low birth who professed to be the son of Antiochus Epiphanes, and eventually became king of Syria. His claims were recognised by the Romans, who desired to revenge themselves on Demetrius Soter; and their example was followed by the king of Egypt and other monarchs. Demetrius was at first victorious, but in 150 B.c. was slain in battle, and Balas obtained possession of the kingdom. The new king soon made himself hateful to his subjects by his voluptuousness and debauchery, and this encouraged Demetrius Nicator, the eldest son of Demetrius Soter, to claim his father’s crown. Alexander took the field against him, but was defeated in a pitched battle, and fled to Abae in Arabia, where he was murdered by the emir, with whom he had sought refuge, 145 b.c.
