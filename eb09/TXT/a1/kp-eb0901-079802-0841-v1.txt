ANASTASIUS I., Emperor of Constantinople, was born at Dyrrhachium not later than 430 a.d. At the time of the death of Zeno (491), Anastasius, though only one of the guards (silentiarii) in the palace, held a very high character, and was raised to the throne of the Roman empire of the East, mainly through the influence of Ariadne, Zeno’s widow, whom he married shortly after his accession. His reign, though afterwards disturbed by foreign and intestine wars and religious distractions, commenced auspiciously. He gained the popular favour by a judicious remission of taxation, and displayed great vigour and energy in administering the affairs of the empire. The principal wars in which Anastasius was engaged were those known as the Isaurian and the Persian. The former (492-8) was stirred up by the supporters of Longinus, the brother of Zeno, and resulted in Anastasius’s favour; in the latter (502-5) he was signally defeated, but the provinces the Persians had won from him were restored on payment of a ransom. He also suffered defeat at the hands of the Goths of Italy, to check whose incursions he built the “Anastasian wall,” extending from the Propontis to the Euxine. For the support he gave to the Eutychians, Anastasius was anathematised by Pope Symmachus. The latter years of his reign were troubled by revolts in Constantinople, excited by his avarice and by his reputed heretical tendencies. He died in 518.
