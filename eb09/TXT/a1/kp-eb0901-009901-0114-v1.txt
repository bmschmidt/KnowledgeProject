ACORUS, a genus of monocotyledonous plants belonging to the natural order Aroideae, and the sub-order Orontiaceae. Acorus Calamus, sweet-sedge or sweet-flag, is a native of Britain. It has an agreeable odour, and has been used as a strengthening remedy, as well as to allay spasms. The starchy matter contained in its running stem or rhizome is associated with a fragrant oil, and it is used as hair-powder. Confectioners form a candy from the rhizomes of the plant, and it is also used by perfumers in preparing aromatic vinegar.
