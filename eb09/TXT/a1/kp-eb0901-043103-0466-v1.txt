AITZEMA, Leon van, Dutch historian and statesman, was born at Doccum, in Friesland, on the 19th November 1600, and died at the Hague on the 23d February 1669. In his youth he published a volume of Latin poems under the title of Poemata Juvenilia. He subsequently devoted himself almost entirely to political life, and held for a lengthened period the position of resident at the Hague for the towns of the Hanseatic League. His most important work was the Historie oft Verhaal van Sa Ã¤ ken van Staet in Oorlogh (14 vols 4to, 1657-71), embracing the period from 1621 to 1668. It contains a large number of state documents, and is an invaluable authority on one of the most eventful periods of Dutch history.
