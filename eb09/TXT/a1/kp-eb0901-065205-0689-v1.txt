AMALTEO, the name of a family belonging to Oderzo, Treviso, several members of which were distinguished in literature. The best known are three brothers, Geronimo (1507-74), Giambattista (1525-73), and Cornelio (1530- 1603), whose Latin poems were published in one collection under the title Trium Fratrum Amaltheorum Carmina (Venice, 1627; Amst. 1689). The eldest brother, Geronimo, was a celebrated physician; the second, Giambattista, accompanied a Venetian embassy to England in 1554, and was secretary to Pius IV. at the Council of Trent; the third, Cornelio, was a physician and secretary to the republic of Ragusa.
