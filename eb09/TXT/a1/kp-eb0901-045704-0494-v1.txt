ALCALA DE GUADAIRA, a town of Spain, in the province of Seville, Andalusia, situated on the Guadaira, 7 miles E. of Seville. It contains an old castle and other Moorish remains; but it is now chiefly remarkable for the excellent quality of its bread, whence the epithet de los Panaderos, sometimes applied to it. Nearly the whole of the bread required by the town of Seville is made here. Population, 7000.
