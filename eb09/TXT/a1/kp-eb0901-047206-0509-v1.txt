ALDEGREVER, or Aldegraf, Heinrich, a German painter and engraver, born in 1502 at Paderborn, from which he removed in early life to Soest. From the close resemblance of his style to that of his master, Albert Dürer, he has sometimes been called the Albert of Westphalia. His numerous engravings, chiefly from his own designs, are delicate and minute, though somewhat hard in style, and entitle him to a place in the front rank of the so-called “Little Masters.” Specimens of his painting are exceedingly rare. The genuineness of the works in the Vienna and Munich collections attributed to him is at least doubtful, the only unchallenged example being a portrait in the gallery at Berlin. Aldegrever died about the year 1562.
