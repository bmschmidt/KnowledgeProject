AMMAN, Paul, a physician and botanist, w as born at Breslau on the 30th August 1634. In 1662 he received the degree of doctor of physic from the university of Leipsic, and in 1664 was admitted a member of the society Naturoe Curiosorum, under the name of Dr y ander. Shortly afterwards he was chosen extraordinary professor of medicine in the above-mentioned university; and in 1674 he was promoted to the botanical chair, which he again in 1682 exchanged for the physiological. He died on the 4th February 1691. Paul Amman seems to have been a man of acute mind and extensive learning; but a restless and irritable disposition led him to engage too much in controversy, and to indulge in raillery in his writings to a degree λvhich the nature of the subjects hardly warranted.

Amman’s principal works were— Medicina Critica, seu Centuria Casuum, in Facultate Lipsiensi resolutorum, variis Discursibus aucta; Paraenesis ad Docentes occupata circa Institutionum, Medicarum Emendationem; Irenicum Numae Pompilii cum, Hippocrate; Supellea> Botanica, et Manuductio ad Materiam, Medicam,; and. Character Naturalis Plantarum.
