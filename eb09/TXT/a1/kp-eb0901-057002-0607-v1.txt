ALGOA BAY, an inlet in Cape Colony, on the S.E. coast of Africa, 425 miles east from the Cape of Good Hope. Lat. of Croix Island, in the bay, 30° 47' N., and long. 25° 46'. Algoa Bay lies between capes Recife and Padrone, on the former of which there is a lighthouse. It receives the rivers Sunday and Baasher. The best anchorage is on the west side of the inlet, near Port Elizabeth, which is the most important seaport on the south coast of Africa. Here the holding ground is good, and the anchorage is sheltered, except from the south-east winds. Fort Frederick stands on a hill overlooking Port Elizabeth. Algoa Bay was the first landing-place of the British emigrants to the eastern province of the Cape Colony, and as the harbour of that province it enjoys a rapidly increasing trade.
