ALAIN DE LILLE (Alanus ab Insulis), theologian and ecclesiastic, born at Lille or Ryssel about the year 1114. The facts of his life are involved in uncertainty, owing to his having been frequently confounded by biographers with others, nearly contemporary, who bore the same name. Some have identified him with Alanus, bishop of Auxerres; others confound him with an elder Alanus, also born at Lille. These, however, were probably three distinct persons. Of the theological writer known as the doctor universalis, all that can be said with certainty is that he was a Cistercian monk. It is probable that he passed a great part of his life in England, though he ended his days in the abbey of Citeaux. His works are very numerous, the most important of them being entitled Anti-Claudiarnus, sive de Officio Viri Boni et Perfecti The title denotes that the work takes for its model Claudian’s satire against Rufinus, the minister of Theodosius. It is written in verse, and partakes somewhat of the character of an encyclopaedia. Alain’s De Arte Catholicae Fidei is remarkable for its endeavour to base dogmatic theology on the exact reasoning of mathematical demonstration, and for its admission that heresy was to be overcome by argument and not by mere authority. His exposition of the prophecies of Merlin, in seven books, is of some importance in its bearing upon English history. A Life of St Bernard and a treatise against heretics, usually included among the works of this author, are, from internal evidence, to be attributed with more probability to the bishop of Auxerres. Alain died about 1202-3.
