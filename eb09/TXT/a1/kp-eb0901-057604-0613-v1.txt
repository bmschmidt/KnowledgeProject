ALISON, Rev. Archibald, an author of great reputation in his own day, was born on the 13th November 1757 at Edinburgh, of which his father was for a time lord provost. After studying at the university of Glasgow and at Balliol college, Oxford, he took orders in the Church of England, and was appointed in 1778 to the curacy of Brancepeth, near Durham. In 1780 he married Dorothea, youngest daughter of Professor Gregory of Edinburgh. The next twenty years of his life were spent in Shropshire, where he held in succession the livings of High Ercall, Roddington, and Kenley. In 1800 he removed to Edinburgh, having been appointed senior incumbent of St Paulâ€™s chapel in the Cowgate. For thirty-four years he filled this position with great acceptance, his preaching attracting so many hearers that a new and larger church was built for him. His last years were spent at Colinton, near Edinburgh, where he died on the 17th May 1839. Mr Alison published, besides a Life of Lord Woodhouselee, a volume of sermons, which passed through several editions, and a work entitled Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste, which received a very laudatory criticism from Lord Jeffrey in the Edinburgh Review for May 1811. His theory of the beautiful, which is based on the principle of association, is incomplete and unsatisfactory, and his work is now only of historical importance. Two sons of Mr Alison attained distinction. The elder, Dr William Pulteney Alison, born in 1790, was from 1820 until within a few years of his death, in 1859, a prominent member of the medical faculty in the university [9:1:577] of Edinburgh. The younger son is the subject of the following notice.
