ADIT (from adire, to go to), a passage or door. The doors of porticoes in ancient theatres were called adits. In mines the name is given to a gallery or passage, nearly horizontal, by which water is carried off. Ores also are sometimes removed by the adit. Some works of this kind are of great magnitude. The great Cornish adit at Gwennap, near Falmouth, extends, with its branches, to from 30 to 40 miles in length, and drains a tract of 5500 acres.
