ADONIS, a genus of ranunculaceous plants, known commonly by the names of Pheasantâ€™s Eye and Flos Adonis. There are ten or twelve species given by authors, but they may be probably reduced to three or four. There are two indigenous species, Adonis autumnalis and Adonis aestivalis. They are commonly cultivated. An early flowering species, Adonis vernalis, is well worthy of cultivation.
