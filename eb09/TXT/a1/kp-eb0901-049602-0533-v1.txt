ALEXANDRIA, a town and port of entry of the United States, capital of Alexandria county, Virginia, is beautifully situated on the right bank of the Potomac, 7 miles below Washington. It is neat and well-built, with a good harbour, and exports considerable quantities of gram and flour; but its foreign trade has decreased. The Chesapeake and Ohio canal begins here, and the town is connected with Washington by railway. Population (1870), 13,570.
