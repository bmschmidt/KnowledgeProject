ALEXANDRIA, a town of Scotland, in the parish of Bonhill, Dumbartonshire, pleasantly situated on the west bank of the river Leven, about 3 miles from Dumbarton, with which it is connected by a branch railway. It is a place of comparatively recent growth, owing its origin almost entirely to the cotton print and bleaching works of the vicinity, for which there is an abundant supply of excellent water. Population (1871), 4650.
