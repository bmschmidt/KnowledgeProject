ALPHA and OMEGA (A and Ω), the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, frequently employed to symbolise the idea of completeness or infinity. They are used as a designation of himself by the speaker in Rev. i. 8; xxi. 6; xxii. 13. In the last passage the speaker is undoubtedly Jesus Christ. In the symbolism of the early church A and Ω, combined with a cross or with the monogram of Χ ριστός , represented Christianity, or, more specifically, faith in the divinity of Christ.
