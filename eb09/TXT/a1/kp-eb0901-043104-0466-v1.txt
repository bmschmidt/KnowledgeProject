AIX, an ancient city of France, the chief town of the arrondissement of the same name, in the department of the Bouches-du-Rhone. It was the Aquae Sextiae of the Romans, and between this and Arelate (Arles) is the field on which Marius gained his great victory over the Teutons. Under the counts of Provence, Aix became celebrated as a seat of learning; and it still retains many relics of its former splendour, and is distinguished by the number and excellence of its literary institutions. It has a library of 100,000 volumes, an academy of law, science, and theology, a museum, and a chamber of commerce. The cathedral—the baptistry of which is said to have been constructed from the remains of a Roman temple—the “Palais,” the town-hall, and the clock-tower, are fine specimens of ancient architecture. There are numerous public fountains, on one of which is sculptured a figure of King Réné by David. The hot springs, from which the city derives its name, are not now in much repute. Aix is the seat of a court of justice and an archbishopric. The chief manufactures are cotton, silk, thread, and hardware; and olives and almonds are cultivated on the surrounding hills. There is considerable commerce in corn, wine, and oiL The naturalists Adanson and Tournefort, and the painter Vanloo, were born at Aix. Population (1872), 29,020.
