ALMAGRO, a town of Spain, in the province of Ciudad Real, 12 miles E.S.E. of the town of that name. It stands in a fertile plain, and is a well-built town, with spacious streets and a fine square. It was once almost exclusively inhabited by monks and the Knights of Calatrava, and contains several ruined churches, monasteries, and convents. In the town and neighbourhood lace is extensively manufactured, as many as 9000 workmen being employed. Brandy, soap, earthenware, and leather are also made; and the surrounding district is famous for its breed of asses and mules, for the sale of which two great fairs are annually held. Excellent red wine is produced in the district. Population, 14,000.
