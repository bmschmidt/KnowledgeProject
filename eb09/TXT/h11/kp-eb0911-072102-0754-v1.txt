HERBERT, Henry William (1807-1858), novelist and writer on sports, son of the Hon. and Rev. William Herbert, dean of Manchester, a son of the first earl of Carnarvon, was born in London, April 7, 1807. He was educated at Eton and at Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated M.A. in 1828. Having become involved in debt he emigrated to America, and from 1831 to 1839 was teacher of Greek in a private school in New York. In 1833 he commenced the American Monthly Magazine, which he edited till 1835. In 1834 he published his first novel, The Brothers, a Tale of the Fronde, which was followed by a number of others, all of them obtaining a certain degree of popularity. He was also successful in a series of historical studies, such as The Cavaliers of England, The Knights of England, France, and Scotland, The Chevaliers of France, and The Captains of the Old World, and wrote numerous contributions to magazines; but he is best known for his works on sporting, published by him under the pseudonym of Frank Forester. These include The Field Sports of the United States and British Provinces (1849), Frank Forester and his Friends (1849), The Fish and Fishing of the United States (1850), The Young Sportsman's Complete Manual, and The Horse and Horsemanship in the United States and British Provinces of North America (1858). Herbert was a man of varied accomplishments, but of somewhat dissipated habits. He died by his own hand at New York, May 17, 1858.
