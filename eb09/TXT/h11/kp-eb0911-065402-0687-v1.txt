HENNEBONT, a town of France, arrondissement of Lorient, and department of Morbihan, is situated on the Blavet, not far from its mouth, and 25 miles W.N.W. of Vannes. It is a picturesque old town, and contains some remains of its former fortifications. The church of Notre Dame de Paradis, a beautiful building of the 16th century, possesses some fine wood carving. The town has an important corn-market, and considerable shipping trade in iron, corn, honey, wax, hemp, cider, and wine. Shipbuilding, sawing, and tanning are also carried on. Hennebont is famed for the resistance which it made, under the widow of John de Montfort, when besieged by the armies of Philip of Valois and Charles of Blois. The population in 1876 was 4844.
