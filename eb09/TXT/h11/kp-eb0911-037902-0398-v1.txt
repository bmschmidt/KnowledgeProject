HAL, a town of Belgium, province of South Brabant, is situated on the Senne and the Charleroi canal, 9 miles S.S.W. of Brussels. It has a beautiful Gothic church of the 14th century, very much resorted to by pilgrims on account of a famous miracle-working image of the Virgin. The church has been enriched by a large number of votive gifts, and contains a beautifully carved high altar of white marble. The principal industries are tanning, soap-boiling, the manufacture of paper, and salt-refining. The population in 1869 was 6406.
