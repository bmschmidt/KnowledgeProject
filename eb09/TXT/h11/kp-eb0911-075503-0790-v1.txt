HERODIANS ('Hpωδιαvoi), a sect or party mentioned in Scripture as having on two occasions—once in Galilee, and again in Jerusalem—manifested an unfriendly disposition towards Jesus (Mark iii. 6; xii. 13; Matt, xxii. 6; cf. also Mark viii. 15). In each of these cases their name is coupled with that of the Pharisees. According to many interpreters the courtiers or soldiers of Herod Anti pas (“Milites Herodis,” Jerome; “Diener Herodis,” Luther) are intended; but more probably the Herodians were a public political party, who distinguished themselves from the two great historical parties of post-exilian Judaism by the fact that they were and had been sincerely friendly to Herod the Great and to his dynasty (c∕. such formations as “Caesariani,” “Pompeiani ”). For the evidence which goes [9:11:756] to show that neither the Pharisees nor the Sadducees as such could in consistency have been really thus friendly, reference may be made to Hausrath (especially his NeuTestamentliche Zeitgeschichte, and article “Herodianer” in Schenkel’s Bibel- Lexicon), and to Wellhausen (Pharisäer u. Sadducäer, 1873). It is possible that, to gain adherents, the Herodian party may have been in the habit of representing that the establishment of a Herodian dynasty would be favourable to the realization of the theocracy; and this in turn may suggest some explanation of Tertullian’s (De Proescr.) palpably absurd allegation that the Herodians regarded Herod himself as the Messiah.
