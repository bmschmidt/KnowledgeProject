HAINICHEN, a town of Saxony, in the circle of Leipsic and the prefecture of Döbeln, is situated on the Little Striegis, 15 miles N.E. of Chemnitz by railway. It is the seat of a royal court of justice, and has cigar and leather manufactories and a school of weaving. Its most important industry is the manufacture of flannels, baize, and similar fabrics; indeed it may be called the centre of this industry in Germany. The special whiteness and excellence of the flannel made in Hainichen is due to the peculiar nature of the water used in the manufacture. There are 22 spinningmills in the town and environs, with about 2500 looms, of which between 300 and 400 are mechanical. There are also large dye-works and bleaching establishments. Large quantities of both wool and cotton are spun and woven, and yarn spun elsewhere is brought to Hainichen to be woven. About 3,850,000 ft) of raw wool, worth about £600,000, is annually worked into material, some of which is exported to South America and eastern Asia. Coal is found in the neighbourhood, but does not repay the expense of working. Hainichen is the birthplace of Gellert, to whose memory a bronze statue was erected in the market-place in 1865. The Gellert institution for the poor was erected in 1815. Population (1875), 8468.
