HERMOGENES, of Tarsus, Greek rhetorician, flourished in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. His precocious ability secured him a public appointment as teacher of his art while as yet he was only a boy; but at the age of twenty-five his faculties gave way, and he spent the long remainder of his life in a state of intellectual impotency. In the nine or ten years, however, of his activity he composed a whole series of treatises on matters rhetorical, which became popular text-books, and the subject of subsequent commentaries. Of his Tεχvη ρητορική Wθ still possess ∏εpι των στάσεων; Περί ευρεσεων; Hεpι ιδεών; Περί μεθόδου δεινότητας; and Τίρογυμνάσματα.

The last-mentioned was only known from Priscian’s Latin translation till the publication by Heeren of the Greek original discovered at Turin (Bibl. fur alte Lit. und Kunst, Gott., 1791). Richard Volkmann, in Animadversiones criticae in nonnullos veterum de proeexercitationibus rhetoricis locos (Jauer, 1869), discusses the relation of the original to Priscian’s translation, and treats them as sources of reciprocal emendation.
