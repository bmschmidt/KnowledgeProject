HALL, a town in northern Tyrol, Austria, government district of Innsbruck, is picturesquely situated between two mountains on the left bank of the Inn, which is navigable there, and on the railway from Rosenheim to Innsbruck, 5 miles east of the latter. It is the seat of a district court, of a board of salt-works, and of a provincial board of mines. The beautiful Gothic parish church, dating from the 13th century, contains an altar-piece by a pupil of Rubens and the copy of a Christ by Albert DÃ¼rer. The principal other public buildings are several monasteries, the gymnasium, the deaf and dumb institute, and the lunatic asylum. The prosperity of the town depends chiefly upon its salt-works, which are supplied by pipes from the mines at Salzberg, 9 miles distant; the annual yield of salt is from 15,000 to 16,000 tons. A considerable number of invalids visit the town on account of its salt-water baths. The principal other industries are the manufacture of woollen cloth, thread, paper, and substitutes for coffee. Hall obtained town rights in 1303. It suffered considerably from earthquakes in 1663 and 1670. In 1809 the patriot Speckbacher on three separate occasions succeeded in storming the position of the Bavarians on the bridge which crosses the Inn at this point. The population in 1870 was 5010.
