HANUSCH, Ignaz Johann (1812-1869), Bohemian savant and philosopher, was born at Prague on the 28th November, 1812. He received his early education in his native city, and taught for a short time in a monastic school there. At the universities of Prague and Vienna, where he afterwards studied, he directed his attention successively to theology and law, and finally, under the influence cf Flegel’s writings, to philosophy. After temporarily supplying in 1835 the place of Lichtenfels, professor of philosophy at Vienna, he was next year appointed ordinary professor of philosophy at Lemberg, whence he passed in the same capacity to Olmiitz in 1847, and two years later to Prague. There he began a successful course of philosophy in the Czech language, but in 1852 was abruptly suspended from teaching, owing to his leanings towards Slavism. He still, however, retained his full salary; and in 1860 he was nominated director of the imperial university library at Prague, where he died on the 19th May 1869.

Ilis chief writings, mainly on philosophic and Slavonic subjects, are the following:— Wissenschaft des Slaτischen Mythus (1842); text-books in Logic (1843), Ethics (1866), Metaphysics (1846), and Empirical Psychology (1849); Geschichte der Philosophie von ihren Uranfängen bis zur Schliessung der Philosophenschulen unter Justinian (1850); Vorlesungen über die Kulturgeschichte der Menschheit (1849); Quellenkunde und Bibliographie der böhmischslowenischen Literatur (1868). Besides these and others, Hanusch wrote some works in Czech, and published the works of the old Slavonic philosopher, Bitter Thomas, in 1852.
