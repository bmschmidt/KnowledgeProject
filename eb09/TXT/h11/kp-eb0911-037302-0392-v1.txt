HAHN, Johann Georg von (1810-1869), an Austrian traveller, to whom we are indebted for most of our knowledge about the Albanians, was born at Jena in 1810.

Zach from Belgrade to Saloniki (Thessalonica), for the purpose mainly of ascertaining the feasibility of constructing a railway from the Danube to the Aegean; and an account of their experiences was published in the Denkschriften der Kaiserl, Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Wien, Phil. Hist. Klasse, Bd. xi., Vienna, 1861. This paper, reprinted in 1871, contained valuable matter in regard to the Albanians, and especially in regard to their geographical distribution.

Klasse, 1867)—“Reise durch die Gebiete des Drin und Wardar.” Since the author’s death a large work has appeared under the title of Sagwissenschaftliche Studien (Jena, 1872-73), in which he deals learnedly with numerous questions in comparative mythology·
