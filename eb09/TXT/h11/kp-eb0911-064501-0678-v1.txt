HEMEL-HEMPSTEAD, a market-town of England, county of Hertford, is pleasantly situated on the declivity of a hill near the river Gade, 23 miles N.W. of London, 1∣ miles from the Boxmoor station of the London and North-Western Railway, and on a branch line of the Midland Railway. The town consists almost wholly of one main street about a mile in length. Among the principal buildings are the parish church, cruciform in shape, and paιtly Norman in style, surmounted by a lofty octagonal spire, and containing an old brass of the time of Edward 111.; the town-hall, a long narrow building formerly supported on square wooden pillars, but whose open market place underneath has now been converted into a corn exchange; the union workhouse, and the West Herts infirmary. The chief industry is straw plaiting, but there are also manufactories of paper, an iron foundry, breweries, and tanneries. The population of the township in 1871 was 5996, and of the parish 8720.

From its name, meaning high stead or place, the town is apparently of Saxon origin. In Domesday it is written Henamsteda and Hamelamestede. It received a charter of incorporation from Henry VIII., which was renewed by Cromwell. It still makes annual choice of a bailiff, but he possesses no magisterial authority.
