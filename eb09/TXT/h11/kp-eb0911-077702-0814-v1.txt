HESEKIEL, George Louis (1818-1874), German author and journalist, was born August 12, 1818, in Halle, where his father, a man of considerable distinction, was a preacher and inspector of schools. Hesekiel studied history and philosophy in Halle, Jena, and Berlin, and devoted himself in early life to journalism and literature. In 1848 he settled in Berlin, where he lived till his death, February 26, 1874, achieving a considerable reputation both as a writer of books and as editor of the Heue Preussische Zeitung. He attempted many different kinds of literary work, the most ambitious being perhaps his patriotic songs, of which he published a volume during the revolutionary excitement of' 1848-49. Another collection— Nene Preussenlieder— appeared in 1864 after the Danish war, and there was a third in 1870— Gegen die Franzosen, Preussische Kriegs- und Königslieder. Among his novels may be mentioned Vier Junker (1864) and Der Schultheiss vom Zeyst (1875). By far the best known of his works is his life of Prince Bismarck— Das Buch vom Fürsten Bismarck (3d edition, enlarged, 1873). This biography, which has been translated into English by R. R. H. Mackenzie, is written from the point of view of an ardent admirer of the great chancellor. It is of no value as an estimate of his political importance, but it has acquired a certain popularity because of the mass of more or less interesting anecdotes which the author has brought together respecting both the public and the private life of his hero. It has lately, however, been rather thrust into the shade by the more piquant revelations of Herr Busch.
