HAMILTON, a city of the United States, capital of Butler county, Ohio, is situated on both sides of the Great Miami river, on the Miami and Erie canal, and at the junction of several railways, 23 miles N. of Cincinnati. The water-power for manufacturing purposes is obtained by an hydraulic canal which secures a fall of 30 feet; and the situation of the city in the heart of the Miami valley, a rich agricultural district, is very favourable to the development of commercial enterprise. It possesses two public parks, twelve churches, two national banks, a complete graded system of public schools, an orphansâ€™ home, and a free library. Its industries are of a varied kind, and are represented by paper and woollen factories, flourmills, foundries, breweries, distilleries, bleaching works, machine shops, and manufactories of carriages and waggons, reaping machines, ploughs, and other agricultural implements, sashes and blinds, railroad supplies, and machinery. Hamilton received a municipal charter in 1853, at which time the portion on the west side of the river formerly called Rossville was incorporated with it. The population, which in 1860 was 7223, and in 1870 11,081, of whom 3062 were foreigners, was estimatedin 1879 at 17,000.
