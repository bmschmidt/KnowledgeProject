HARRIS, John (1802-1856), divine and theologian, was born at Ugborough in Devonshire, March 8, 1802. At the age of fifteen he joined the Independent Church, and began to preach to the rustics of the neighbourhood as a member of the Bristol Itinerant Society. After studying at the Independent college at Hoxton he was in 1827 ordained pastor of a small congregation at Epsom. There in 1836 he wrote his essay, Hammon, or Covetousness the Sin of the Christian Church, which won a prize of 100 guineas offered by Dr Conquest, and brought its author into notice, thirty thousand copies being sold within a few years. In 1838 he received the degree of doctor of divinity from Brown University, America, and was appointed president and professor of theology in Cheshunt college; and in 1850, when the Independent colleges at Highbury, Homerton, and Coward, near London, were united, Dr Harris was elected principal of the New College thus formed. He died December 21, 1856.

Besides Mammon, he wrote the Great Teacher (1835); two prize essays, Britannia (1837) and The Great Commission (1842); and Contributions to Theological Science. The Î¡re-Adamite Earth (1847), Man Primaeval (1849), and Patriarchy (1855), form the beginning of a series, intended to illustrate the history of man from a theological point of view, but interrupted by his death.
