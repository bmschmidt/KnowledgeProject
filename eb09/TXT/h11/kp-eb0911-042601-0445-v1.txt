HAMMERFEST, the most northern town in Europe, is situated in the department of Hammerfest in the province of Finmark, on the western side of the island of Kvalö (‰e., “Whale Island”), which lies off the north-western coast of Norway. Its latitude is 70° 39' 15'', and the sun stays for two months above its horizon. Though a small place of about 2100 inhabitants, it is the seat of a considerable trade, in which not only Norwegian and Danish but English, German, and particularly Russian vessels are engaged. About thirty small ships are sent out from Hammerfest every spring to Spitzbergen to take part in the fisheries and walrus hunting. Train oil from the liver of the Scymnus microcephalus and cod-liver oil are manufactured in the town. The exports, among which salted fish occupies the principal place, amounted in 1876 to the value of 1,629,500 crowns (£90,528), and the imports, chiefly salt and coal, to 721,700 (£40,094). On the Fuglenaes or Birds’ Cape, which protects the harbour on the north, there stands a column with an inscription in Norse and Latin, stating that Hammerfest was one of the stations of the expedition for the measurement of the arc of the meridian. Nor is this its only association with science; for it was one of the spots chosen by Captain Sabine for his series of pendulum experiments. The ascent of the Tyven or Diebsberg in the neighbourhood is usually undertaken by travellers.
