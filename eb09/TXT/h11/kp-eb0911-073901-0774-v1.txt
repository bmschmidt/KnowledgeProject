HERISAU, the largest town in the Swiss half-canton of Appenzell-ausser-Rhoden, is situated at the confluence of the Glatt and Brühlbach, 7 miles north-west of Appenzell, and about 2550 feet above sea-level. The town is irregularly built, and extends over a large area. The church-tower, in which the archives are kept, is referred to the 7th century. Herisau has a public library, an arsenal, a new townhouse, and a hospital, and is the seat of the cantonal council and of a district court of justice. The manufactures comprise muslin, cotton, and silk. Christianity was introduced at Herisau (a name during the Middle Ages Latinized as Augia Domini) about the beginning of the 7th century. The nobles of Herisau were its first superiors, but their power passed in 1390 into the hands of the abbots of St Gall, from whose somewhat oppressive rule the people bought themselves free in 1463. The population in 1870 was 9736. In the neighbourhood beautiful walks lead to the interesting ruins of the castles of Rosenberg and Rosen-burg. The baths and goat’s-whey cure of Heinrichsbad are about a mile to the north-east.
