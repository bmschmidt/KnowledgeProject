HADDOCK (Gadus oeglefinus, the ScheU-fisck of the Germans, Hadot of the French), a kind of cod-fish, distinguished by a black lateral line and a blackish spot above the pectoral fin. It is common round the British and Irish coasts, and generally distributed along the shores of the North Sea, extending across the Atlantic to the coast of North America. The haddock is prone, however, to abandon for a longer or shorter period a locality frequented by it. It attains to a weight of 15 ft>, and is one of the most valuable food fishes of Europe.
