Area, 312 square miles; population (1872), 28,025 (Hindus, 23,345; Mahometans, 122; and “others,” 4558). The Cuttack and Sambalpur highroad runs through the state. Only five villages contain upwards of 100 houses. Hindol consisted originally of three or four petty states, completely buried in jungle, and ruled by separate chiefs, till two Marhattâ brothers, belonging to the family of the Kimidi Râjâ in Madras, drove them out, and formed their territories into one principality. The present chief maintains a military force of 83 men, and a police force 133 strong. His estimated annual revenue is returned at .£2082; tribute, £55.
