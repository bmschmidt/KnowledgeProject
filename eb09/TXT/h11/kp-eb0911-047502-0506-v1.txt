HARDWÂR, or Hurdwar, an ancient town of India and place of pilgrimage, in Sahâranpur district, North-Western Provinces, situated on the right bank of the Ganges at the foot of the Siwâlik Hills, in 29° 57' 30" N. lat., 78° 12' 52" E. long. Population (1872), 4800. The town is of great antiquity, and has borne many names. It was originally known as Kapila from the sage Kapila. Hwen Thsang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, in the 7th century A.D. visited a city which he calls Mo-yu-lo, the remains of which still exist at Mâyapur, a little to the south of the modern town. Among the ruins are a fort and three temples,. decorated with broken stone sculptures. The great object of attraction at present is the Hari-ke-charan, or bathing ghat, with the adjoining temple of Gangadwâra. The char an, or foot-mark of Vishnu, is imprinted on a stone let into the upper wall of the ghât, and forms an object of special reverence. A great assemblage of people takes place annually, and every twelfth year a feast of peculiar sanctity occurs, known as a Kumbh-mela. The ordinary number of pilgrims at the annual fair amounts to 100,000, and at the Kumbh-mela to 300,000. The Hardwâr meeting also possesses considerable mercantile importance, being one of the principal horse-fairs in Upper India. Commodities of all kinds, Indian and European, find a ready sale, and the trade in grain and food-stuffs forms a lucrative traffic. The Ganges canal draws its supply of water from a branch channel close to the town. Hardwar is a police station, with post and telegraph offices.
