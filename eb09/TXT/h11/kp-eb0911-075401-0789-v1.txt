HERNÖSAND, chief town and seat of the administration of the län of Wester Norrland on the east coast of Sweden, is built on the island of Hernö (connected with the mainland by bridges), about 3 miles south of the mouth of the Angerman river, and 230 miles north of Stockholm. It is the seat of a bishop and possesses a fine church, erected in 1842-46. There are engine works, timber-yards, saw-mills, and various manufactories in the town. The harbour is good. In 1878, 33 vessels, chiefly engaged in the timber trade, with a total burthen of 7698 tons, entered and cleared at the port. Tar is also exported, and there is an institution for pisciculture in the town. Hernösand was founded in 1584, and received its first town privileges from John III. in 1587. The population in 1876 was 4912.
