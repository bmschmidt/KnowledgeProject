HACHETTE, Louis Christophe François (1800- 1864), a French publisher, was born at Rethel in the Ardennes, May 5, 1800. After studying three years at a norιnιl school with the view of becoming a teacher, he was in 1822 on political grounds expelled from the seminary. He then devoted several years to the study of jurisprudence; but in 1826 he resolved to establish in Paris a publishing bu3ine33, the main object of which should be the issue of works adapted to improve the system of school instruction, or to promote the general culture of the community. The series of works which from that time were brought out by him included manuals in various departments of knowledge, dictionaries of modern and ancient languages, education ιl journals, and French, Latin, and Greek classics annotated with great care by the most eminent authorities. Subsequent to 1850 he, in conjunction with other partners, published a cheap railway library, scientific and miscellaneous libraries, an illustrated library for the young, libraries of ancient literature, of modern fore.ign literature, and of modern foreign romance, a series of guide-books, and a series of dictionaries of universal reference. In 1855 he also founded Le Journal pour tous, a publication with a circulation of 150,000 weekly. There can be no question that by his efforts to circulate such a variety of wholesome and instructive literature, Hachette is entitled to rank among the greatest benefactors of his country. He aho manifested great interest in the formation of mutual friendly societies among the working classes, in the establishment of benevolent institutions, and in other questions relating to the amelioration of the poor, on which subjects he wrote various pamphlets; and he lent the weight of his influence towards a just settlement of the question of international literary copyright. He died 31st July 1864.
