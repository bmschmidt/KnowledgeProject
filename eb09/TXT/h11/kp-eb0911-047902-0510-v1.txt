HARIÄNÄ, or Hurreeanah, a tract of country in the Punjab, India, consisting of a level upland plain, interspersed with patches of sandy soil, and largely overgrown with brushwood. The Western Jumna Canal now fertilizes the grounds of a large number of its villages. Since the 14th century Hissâr has been the local capital. During the troublous period which followed on the decline of the Mughal empire, Hariénâ formed the battlefield where the Mar-hattäs, Bhattis, and Sikhs met to settle their territorial quarrels. The whole surrounding country was devastated by the famine of 1783. Since the conquest of the Punjab, Hariânâ has been broken up into the districts of Hissâr, Rohtak, and Sirsa.
