HENKE, Heinrich Philipp Konrad (1752-1809), a learned German theologian of the broad school, best known as a writer on church history, was born at Hehlen, Brunswick, on July 3, 1752, was educated at the gymnasium of Brunswick and the university of Helmstadt, and from 1778 until his death, which occurred on May 2, 1809, held a professorship of theology in that university. His principal work (fdrchengesclüchte, in 6 vols., 1788-1804; 2d ed. 1795-1806) is commended by Baur for fulness, accuracy, and artistic composition, as one of the best in that class of literature. His other works are Lineamenta institutionum fidei Christianoe lιistorico-criticarum (1783), Opuscula Academica (1802), and two volumes of Predigten. His son, Ernst Ludwig Theodor (1801-1872), has also left a name in the literature of theology and ecclesiastical history, having been the author of monographs upon Georg Caliχt u. seine Zeit (1853—60), Papst Pius VII. (1860), Konrad von Marburg (1861), Kaspar Peucer u. Nik. Krell (1865), Jak. Friedr. Fries (1867), as well as of other works.
