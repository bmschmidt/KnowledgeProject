HALMSTAD, the chief town of the Swedish län Halland or Halmstad, is situated on the east shore of the Cattegat, about 76 miles S.S.E. of Gothenburg, and at the mouth of the river Nissa. The castle is the residence of the governor of the province. Mention of the church of Halmstad occurs as early as 1462, and the fortifications are mentioned first in 1225. The latter were demolished in 1736. The Dominican and Franciscan monasteries, formerly in the town, are now quite destroyed. The harbour, built in 1837-40, at a cost of about .£5250, admits ships of 10 feet draught, by means of which some trade in deals, pitch, and tar is carried on. The salmon-fishery is important. An archaeological society holds its meetings in Halmstad, and the popular magazine Svenska Family Journalen is published there. There are both mineral and sea-water baths in the neighbourhood. The oldest town-privileges of Halmstad date from 1307, while the first recorded event in its military history is the battle of Nissa, between Harold Hardrada and Sven Ulfsson. During the revolt of the miner Engelbrekt, it twice fell into the hands of the rebels —in 1434 and 1436. The town appears to have been frequently chosen as the meeting-place of the rulers and delegates of the three northern kingdoms; and under the union of Calmar it was appointed to be the place for the election of a new Scandinavian monarch whenever necessary. The län of Halland formed part of the territory of Denmark in Sweden, and accordingly, in 1534, during his war with the Danes, Gustavus Vasa assaulted and took its chief town. In 1660, by the treaty of Copenhagen, the whole district was ceded to Sweden. In 1676 Charles XII. defeated near Halmstad a Danish army, which was attempting to retake the district, and since that time Halland has formed part of Sweden. The population of the town in 1875 was 7136.
