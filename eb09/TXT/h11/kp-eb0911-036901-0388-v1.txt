HAGEN, a town of Prussia, at the head of a circle in the Arnsberg government of Westphalia, is situated at the confluence of the Empe with the Volme, and at the junction of several railways, 26 miles W.S.W. from Arnsberg. It is the seat of a provincial office, a circle court, a chamber of commerce, a state railway commission, and an agricultural union. It has two Evangelical churches, a Catholic church, an Old Catholic church, a synagogue, a real-school of the first order, a royal provincial trade school, a higher female school, and two infirmaries. Hagen is one of the most flourishing commercial towns in Westphalia, and possesses puddling works for iron and steel, iron foundries, cast-steel works, a large cotton print work, woollen and cotton factories, manufactures of leather, paper, tobacco, and iron and steel wares, breweries, and distilleries. There are large limestone quarries in the vicinity, and also an alabaster quarry. The population in 1875 was 24,335, or including Althagen 26,870.
