HERRNHUT, a town of Saxony, in the circle and 18 miles south-east of the town of Bautzen, and situated on the LÃ¶bau and Zittau Railway, is chiefly known as the principal seat of the Moravian or Bohemian Brotherhood, styled on the Continent Herrnhuter, a colony of whom, fleeing from persecution in their own country, settled at Herrnhut in 1722, on a site presented by Count Zinzendorf. The buildings include houses for the brethren, the sisters, and the widowed of both sexes. The town is remarkable for its regularity, cleanness, and stillness. Linen, paper (to varieties of which Herrnhut gives its name), tobacco, and various minor articles are manufactured. The Hutberg commands a pleasant view. The population in 1875 was 1128. Berthelsdorf, a village about a mile distant, has been the seat of the directorate of the community since about 1789.
