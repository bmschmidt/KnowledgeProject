IBARRA, a city of Ecuador in South America, the capital of the province of Imbabura, is situated on a plain about 2000 feet lower than Quito, from which it is 30 miles distant. Before the earthquake of 1868 it was a place of considerable prosperity, with regular streets and well-built houses, and about 13,000 of a population, but in that terrible disaster it is estimated that no fewer than 10,000 of its inhabitants perished. Cotton and woollen stuffs, laces, hats, brandy, cordials, sugar, and salt were among its industrial products. Ibarra was founded in 1597 by Alvaro de Ibarra, the president of Quito. About a league distant was Carranqui, the birthplace of Atahuallpa, the last of the Incas.
