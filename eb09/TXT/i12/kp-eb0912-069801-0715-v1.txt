IDLE, a town of the West Riding of Yorkshire, in the parish of Calverley, is pleasantly situated on an eminence near the river Aire, on the Great Northern Railway, 9 miles north west of Leeds and 3 north of Bradford. The staple manufacture is woollen cloth; there are also worsted mills, and a cotton-warp factory. There are several stone aud slate quarries in the neighbourhood. The church of the Holy Trinity, erected in 1830 in the Later English style, is a handsome structure with embattled tower crowned with pinnacles; and there are national and other schools, an oddfellows’ hall, a mechanics’ institute, and a church institute. The population (including Windhill, which is a separate vicarage) in 1861 was 9155, and in 1871 it had reached 12,036.
