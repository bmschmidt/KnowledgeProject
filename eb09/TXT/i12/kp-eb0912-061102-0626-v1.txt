ICA, Yca, or Ecca, an inland city of Peru, capital of a district in the department of Lima, situated 170 miles south-south-east of the city of Lima, and 48 miles southsouth-west of Pisco on the Pacific Ocean, with which it is connected by a railway. Between Pisco and lea the country is a desolate and barren desert, but lea itself lies in a fruitful valley surrounded by corn-fields and vineyards. On account of the frequent earthquakes the town has a very ruinous appearance, but it enjoys considerable prosperity, and exports by way of Pisco large quantities of wheat, maize, cotton, coihineal, wine, and spirits. Originally the city, when founded in 1563, was built 4 miles south-east from where it now stands, the change of site taking place after a great earthquake in 1571. Another severe earthquake in 1664 led to a new town being built close to the old one. The population is about 7000.
