INCEST, carnal connexion between persons so related that marriage could not take place between them according to the Levitical rules. In England incest has not generally been treated as a crime, although, along with other offences against morals, it was made punishable by death in 1650. Since the Restoration it has, to use Blackstone’s phrase, been left to the “feeble coercion of the spiritual courts.” Under the divorce law, incest is one of the aggravations of adultery which entitle a wife to divorce her husband. In the law of Scotland, it is a crime nominally punishable with death, but the penalty usually inflicted is penal servitude for life. This sentence was actually pronounced on a man in 1855. In the United States, as in England, incest is not an indictable offence at common law, but it has been made so by the legislation of some of the States.
