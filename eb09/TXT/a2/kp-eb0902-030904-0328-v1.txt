ARATUS, a Greek poet, was born at Soli, in Cilicia. The date of his birth is uncertain, but it is known he lived about 270 b,c., and as he was court-physician to Antigonus Gonatas, king of Macedonia, he must have been contemporary with several of the great Alexandrian writers,—
[9:2:310]

Aristophanes of Byzantium, Aristarchus, and Theocritus. Though not an Alexandrian, Aratus has all the characteristics of that school of poetry. He was learned, and verse furnished him with a vehicle for conveying scientific instruction. His only extant works are two poems, or two fragments of one poem, the first, called Φαινόμενα, in 732 lines, the second, ∆ιoσημειa, in 422 lines. The Phaenomena is a versified imitation or modification of a prose work on astronomy by Eudoxus. It contains little of any value, but one verse has become famous through being quoted by St Paul in his speech from Mars Hill (Acts xvii. 28). The Diosemeia or Prognostics is a treatise on the signs of the weather, accompanied .with practical rules. It is imitated to some extent by Virgil in his Georgies. The poems of Aratus were very popular, particularly among the Romans, who produced three translations, one by Cicero, another by Caesar Germanicus, the third by Festus Avienus. The best modern editions of Aratus are those of Buhle, Buttmann, and Bekker.
