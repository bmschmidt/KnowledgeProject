ANTIGONUS (GONATAS), son of Demetrius Poliorcetes, and grandson of the former Antigonus, was born at Gouni in Thessaly about 319 B.c. On the death of his father in Asia, 283 B.c., he assumed the title of king of Macedonia, but did not obtain possession of the throne till 277, after it had been successively in the hands of Pyrrhus, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy Ceraunus. Antigonus repelled the invasion of the Gauls, and continued in undisputed possession of Macedonia till 273, when Pyrrhus returned from Italy and dethroned him. Pyrrhus fell, 272 b.c., at Argos, and Antigonus was again restored to power. The latter part of his reign was comparatively peaceful, and he gained the affection of his subjects by his mildness of disposition and his cultivation of the arts. He resisted the formation of the Achaean league, but did not resort to arms to enforce his opposition. He died, leaving his kingdom in peace, in the 80th year of his age, and the 44th of his reign, 239 B.c.
