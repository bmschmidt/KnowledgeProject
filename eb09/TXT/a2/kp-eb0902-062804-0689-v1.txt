ARONA, a town in the province of Novara, near the southern extremity of Lago Maggiore. It is well built, and has a gymnasium, an hospital, a port, and dockyard on the lake, and several churches, of which the most important is that of S. Maria, with an altar-piece by Gaudenzio Vinci. There is considerable trade with Germany and Switzerland, and red marble is quarried in the neighbourhood. Count Carlo Borromeo, canonised for his piety and benevolence, was born, in 1538, in the now ruined castle; and on an eminence overlooking the district stands the colossal statue erected in 1697 to his memory by the gratitude of the people. It was executed by Zanello of Pavia and Falcano of Lugano, and is of bronze in the head and hands and feet, and of wrought copper in the remaining portions. It is 66 feet in height, and is raised 46 feet more by its pedestal. It is hollow, and can be ascended from within; the head affords room for three or four persons, and a beautiful view is obtained through the eyes. Population, 3443.
