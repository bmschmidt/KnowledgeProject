APOLLODORUS, an Athenian grammarian, son of Asclepiades, and disciple of Aristarchus, lived about 140 b.c. His most famous production is his Bibliotheca, which treats of the gods and the heroic age; and though the extant work is possibly only an abridgment by another hand of the original, it is of great value in mythological inquiries. The best edition is that of Heyne, 2 vols. 8vo, published in 1803.
