ARMFELT, Gustav Mauritz, Baron, afterwards Count, eldest son of a Finnish nobleman, was born at Juva in 1757. He entered the army and gained the favour of Gustavus III., who appointed him to a post in the service of the Crown Prince, and afterwards made him general of a division of the army in the war against Russia. He was successful in his military operations, and also materially aided the king in quelling a conspiracy of the officers. In 1790 he signed the treaty of peace at Verela; and two years later, when Gustavus was mortally wounded by an assassin, Armfelt was named by him governor of Stockholm. But the regent Charles, the late kingâ€™s brother, was not well disposed towards him, and he took an opportunity to leave the country as ambassador to Naples. While there he entered into a conspiracy to depose the regent. This was discovered; he was outlawed and condemned to death, and his associates were severely punished. The accession of Gustavus IV. restored him to his honours, and after the revolution of 1809, by which the ex-regent became king, he was made president of the military council. Being suspected of having a share in the poisoning of the prince of Augustenburg, he fled from Sweden and took refuge at the Russian court, where he received the highest honours. He died in 1814 at Tzarskoe-Selo.
