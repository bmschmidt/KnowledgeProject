ANTIPHILUS, a painter of the 4th century before Christ, who was placed by the ancient critics in the highest rank after Apelles and Protogenes. He was born in Egypt, taught by Ctesidemus, and patronised by Philip of Macedon, and Ptolemy, son of Lagus. Jealousy is said to have led him to bring a false accusation against Apelles, which resulted, according to the story, in his being handed over to his rival as a slave. In style the two artists were strongly opposed; Antiphilus being remarkable for a certain quickness of conception, facility of execution, and lightness of treatment.
