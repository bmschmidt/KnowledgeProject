ANDRADA, Diego Payva dâ€™ (bom at Coimbra in 1528, died 1575), a learned Portuguese theologian, who distinguished himself at the Council of Trent, to which he was sent by king Sebastian. He wrote seven volumes of sermons, besides several other works, one of which, De Conciliorum Auctoritate, was much esteemed at Rome for the great extension of authority it accorded to the Pope. His Defensio Tridentinoe Fidei, a rare and curious work, in which he discusses, among other subjects, immaculate conception, was published posthumously (1578).
