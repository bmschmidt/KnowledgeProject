ANIME, a resinous exudation from the courbaril tree, which grows in the West Indies and in South America: When imported in. the natural state it is infested with vast numbers of insects, and hence the name. It is of a pale brown colour, transparent, brittle, and in consequence of its agreeable odour is much used for fumigation and in perfumery. Its specific gravity varies from 1Ό28 to 1Ό54. It melts readily over the fire, and softens even with the heat of the mouth, but is insoluble in water. It is dissolved by alcohol, but not completely, unless the spirit be boiling. It is allied to copal in its nature and appearance, and is much used by varnish-makers.
