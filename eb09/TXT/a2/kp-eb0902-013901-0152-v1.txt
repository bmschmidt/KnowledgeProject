ANTONINI ITINERARIUM, a valuable register, still extant, of the stations and distances along the various roads of the Roman empire, seemingly based on official documents, which were probably those of the survey organised by Julius Caesar, and carried out under Augustus. The work has plainly undergone various revisions down to the end of the 3d century. What connection any of the Antonines may have had with it is unknown. The whole Itinerary was printed by H. Stephens at Paris, 1512, and by Wesseling at Amsterdam, 1735. The part relating to Britain appeared at London, 1799, as Iter Britanniarum, with a new commentary, by Thomas Reynolds.
