ANDRONICUS of Cyrrhus, a Greek astronomer, about B.c. 100, built at Athens an octagon tower, with figures carved on each side, representing the eight principal winds. A brazen Triton at the summit, with a rod in his hand, turned round by the wind, pointed to the quarter from which it blew. From this model is derived the custom of placing weathercocks on steeples. A considerable portion of this tower still exists; and, instead of “tower of the winds,” it should be called horologium, the name by which it is designated by Varro.
