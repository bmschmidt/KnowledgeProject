ASPASIUS, a celebrated rhetorician and sophist, was born at Ravenna, and flourished during the early part of the 3d century a.d. He was the son (or, according to Suidas, the scholar) of the rhetorician Demetrianus; and, after a careful training in all the branches of a rhetoricianâ€™s art, began to teach at Rome. For many years he filled the chair of rhetoric which had been founded by Vespasian. He travelled extensively in the suite of the emperor, as [9:2:715] whose secretary he acted, for some time. His orations, which are praised for their style, have been lost.
