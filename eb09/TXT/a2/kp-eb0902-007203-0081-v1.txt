ANNO BOM, or Annabona, a small island off the west coast of Africa, situated in lat. l o 24' S. and long. 5° 35' E., 190 miles west of Cape Lopez. Its length is about four miles, its breadth two; and, rising in some parts to a.height of nearly 3000 feet above the sea, it presents a succession of beautiful valleys and steep mountains, that are covered with rich woods and luxuriant vegetation. The inhabitants, who probably amount to about 3000, are negroes, very ignorant, but professing a belief in the Roman Catholic faith. Their chief town, a village on the northeast of the island, is merely a collection of rude huts, with an equally barbarous chapel. The roadstead is tolerably safe, and passing vessels frequently take advantage of it in order to obtain water and fresh provisions, of which Anno Bom contains an abundant supply. The island was discovered by the Portuguese on the 1st of January 1473, from which circumstance it received its name, “Dia de Anno Bom,” being the Portuguese term for New-Year’s day. It is claimed both by Spain and Portugal, but neither of these nations exercises any authority in the island, which is governed by a native, or rather it is said by a body of five natives, each of whom holds the office of governor in turn, during the period that elapses till ten ships touch at the island.
