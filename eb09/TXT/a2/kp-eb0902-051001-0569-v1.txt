ARISTOPHANES of Byzantium, one of the most famous of the Alexandrian critics, flourished about the middle of the 3d century B.c. He studied under Eratosthenes and Zenodotus, and himself founded a school for grammar and criticism, of which the most distinguished pupil was the great Aristarchus of Samothrace. He was afterwards appointed to the superintendence of the Alexandrian library. Aristophanes, like his great pupil, was celebrated as an Homeric critic, but little is known of the results of his labours on that poet. He seems, however, to have been particularly occupied with the consideration of questions of authenticity. He arranged and commented on the works of Hesiod, Alcaeus, Pindar, Anacreon, Callimachus, Plato, and Aristotle; he also explained and wrote arguments to the plays of Aristophanes and the tragic poets. He is justly celebrated as the inventor of the Greek system of punctuation, accent, and breathing. To him, also, is due in great measure the foundation of the well-known Alexandrian Canon.

The fragments of his works have been collected and published by A. Nauck, Aristophanis Byzantii Fragmenta, 1848. See also, Kreuser, Griech. Accentlehre; Villoisson, Broleg. ad. Hom. II.; F. A. Wolf, Broleg. in Hom.
