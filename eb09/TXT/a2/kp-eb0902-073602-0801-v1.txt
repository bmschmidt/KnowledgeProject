ASTERIUS, Bishop of Amasia, in Pontus, in the end of the 4th and in the beginning of the 5th century. His fame rests chiefly on his Homilies, which were greatly esteemed in the Eastern Church. Most of these have been lost, but five were published in a 4to vol. by Ph. Rubenius of Antwerp in 1615, under the title Asterii Amas. Homil. Quinque, Gr. et Lat. Combefie published six more, so that we have eleven complete; and Dupin gives fragments of at least twenty-two.
