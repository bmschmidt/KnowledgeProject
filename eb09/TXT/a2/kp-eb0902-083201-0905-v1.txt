ATHENODORUS, surnamed Cananites or Sandonus, a Stoic philosopher, was bom at Tarsus. He probably gave instruction to Augustus when he was at Apollonia; and on proceeding to the Roman courts, he was made tutor to Tiberius. The emperor esteemed him greatly for his proved virtue and probity. He was in the habit of giving his opinion very freely, and warned Augustus, whenever he found himself giving way to anger, to rehearse the twenty-four letters of the alphabet before saying or doing anything. Retiring late in life to his native town, he died there at the age of 82. None of his works have survived. Another Stoic of this name, surnamed Cordylion, also of Tarsus, was keeper of the library at Pergamus, and died at Rome in the house of Cato the Younger. There were likewise two sculptors named Athenodorus, one of whom assisted Agesander in the group of the Laocoon.
