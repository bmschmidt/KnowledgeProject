ANTALO, a town of Tigré, in Abyssinia, capital of the district of Enderta, situated in lat. 13° 17' N., and long. 39° 28' E., on a plateau about 8000 feet above the level of the sea, out of which a steep hill rises on the north of the town, while beneath it a wide plain stretches southward. A large part of Antalo is now in ruins, but it still possesses a weekly market of considerable importance, and contains several churches. Its population was once estimated at 8000.
