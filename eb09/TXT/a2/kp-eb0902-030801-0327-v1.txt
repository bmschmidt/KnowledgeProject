ARAN ISLANDS, South, three islands of carboniferous limestone, which lie across Galway Bay, on the west coast of Ireland, in a south-easterly direction, forming a kind of natural breakwater. They are called respectively—beginning with the most northern—Inishmore (or Aranmore), the Great Island; Inishmaan, the Middle Island; and I·nisheer, the Eastern Island. The first has an elevation of 354 feet, the second of 259, and the third of 202. These islands are remarkable for a number of architectural remains of a very early date. In Aranmore—which has been sung by Moore—there stand, on a cliff 220 feet high, large remains of a circular cyclopean tower, called Dun-Aengus, ascribed to the Fir-bolg or Belgae; and seven other similar structures are found in the group. Aranmore also bears the name of Aran-na-naomh, Aran-of-The-Saints, from the number of religious recluses who took up their abode in it, and gave a celebrity to the holy wells, altars, and shrines, to which many are still attracted. No less, indeed, than twenty buildings of ecclesiastical or monastic character have been enumerated in the three islands. The total area is 11,287 acres.
