ANTIOCHUS II. (Theos, the God), the son and successor of Antiochus I. Under him Syria was troubled with a long Egyptian war, and lost Parthia and Bactria, which became independent. He was forced by Ptolemy of Egypt to put away his wife and marry an Egyptian princess, Berenice; but on Ptolemyâ€™s death Berenice was discarded, and Laodice restored. The latter, however, out of revenge or mistrust, procured the death of her husband, her rival, and their son, 246 b.c.
