ARNAUD, or ARNOLDUS, DE VILLA NOVA, a physician, alchemist, and astrologer, who lived at Paris about the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th centuries. The discovery of the three principal acids,— sulphuric, nitric, and hydrochloric,—has been attributed to him, but Hoefer (Hist. de la Chimie., t. i. p. 385) has shown that these had all been discovered long before his time. His works, with a life prefixed, were printed at Lyons, first in 1504, folio, and again with the notes of Nicholas Tolerus, in 1520, folio: also at Basel in 1515 and 1585.
