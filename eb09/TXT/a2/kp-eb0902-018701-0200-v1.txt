APOLLONIUS, surnamed Molo, a distinguished Greek rhetorician, the instructor of Caesar and of Cicero. Born at Alabanda, he settled at Rhodes, and in the dictatorship of Sulla, was sent as ambassador from the Rhodians to Rome. He was the first Greek who addressed the senate without the aid of an interpreter. Cicero renewed his studies under him when he afterwards visited Rhodes on his return from Asia. The works of Apollonius have perished.—Another rhetorician of the same name, likewise a native of Alabanda, and an inhabitant of Rhodes, was surnamed The Effeminate (ό Μαλακός). Both are mentioned by Cicero with high respect.—Cicero, Brutus, 89, 90, 91; De Inv. i. 56; De Orat. i. 17, 28; Quintii, iii. 1, § 16; xii. 6, § 7, &c.
