ARTEVELDE, Philip van, son of the above, lived in retirement till 1381. Some years before that date enmity had again arisen between Count Louis of Flanders and the somewhat turbulent citizens of Ghent, who, under one Hyons, had exp lied the count’s adherents, plundered his house, and slain several of his officers. Hyons died in 1379, and in 1381 the citizens^ under Peter van der Bosch (Dubois), were closely blockaded by the count. In this emergency Van der Bosch proposed that the son of the great Artevelde should be invited to take the direction of affairs. Philip accepted, at once entered on public life, and by some strong measures secured his power. The inhabitants of Bruges had at this time allied themselves with the count, and Artevelde resolved to punish them. He led out his forces quietly, and utterly defeated the army of the count, who escaped with difficulty. Bruges was plundered, and submitted to Artevelde. Next year the French, taking up the cause of Louis, invaded Flanders, and at Rosbecque completely routed the forces of Ghent. Many thousands were slain, and among them Artevelde himself. The brief but stirring life of this popular leader is admirably treated in Sir Henry Taylor’s drama, Philip van Artevelde.
