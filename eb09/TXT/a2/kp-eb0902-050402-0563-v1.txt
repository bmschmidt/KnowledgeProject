ARISTANDER, the favourite soothsayer of Alexander the Great, who consulted him on all occasions. After the death of the monarch, when his body had lain unburied for thirty days, Aristander procured its burial by foretelling that the country in which it was interred would be the most prosperous in the world. He is probably the author of a work on prodigies, which is referred to by Pliny and Lucian.
