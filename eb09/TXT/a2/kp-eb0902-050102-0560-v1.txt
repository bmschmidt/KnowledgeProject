ARGYROPULUS, or Argyropulo, John, a learned Greek who lived during the 15th century. He appears to have crossed over to Italy about 1434, and in 1442 was made rector of the university at Padua. About 1456 he was invited to Florence by some of the Medici, and was there appointed professor of Greek in the university. Fifteen years after he removed to Rome, where he continued to act as professor of Greek till his death, which took place probably soon after 1489. His principal works were translations of the following portions of Aristotle:â€” Categories, De Interpret., Analyt. Post., Physics, De Coelo, De Anima, Metaphysics, Nicom. Ethics, Politics. His only original published writing is an Expositio Ethicorum Aristotelis. Several of his writings exist still in manuscript.
