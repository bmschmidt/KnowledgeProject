ANNABERG, a town of Saxony, situated in the Erzgebirge, about 1830 feet above the level of the sea, and at a distance of 18 miles south from Chemnitz, with which it is connected by railway. The chief importance of Annaberg is derived from its large lace and ribbon manufactories, the latter of which were first established in the town by Belgian Protestants, who were driven from their country by the tyranny of the duke of Alva. There are also extensive and valuable silver, tin, and cobalt mines in the neighbourhood. Population, 11,693.
