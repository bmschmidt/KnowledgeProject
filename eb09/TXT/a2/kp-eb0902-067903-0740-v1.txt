ASCLEPIADES, of Prusa in Bithynia, a celebrated physician, flourished at Rome in the end of the 2d century B,Î± He travelled much when young, and seems at first to have settled at Rome as a rhetorician. In that profession he did not succeed, but he acquired great reputation as a physician. He founded his medical practice on a modification of the atomic or corpuscular theory, according to which disease results from an irregular or inharmonious motion of the corpuscles of the body. His remedies were, therefore, directed to the restoration of harmony, and in many cases were not unpleasant. He trusted most to changes of diet, accompanied by friction, bathing, and exercise, though he also employed emetics and bleeding. He recommended the use of wine, and in every way strove to render himself as agreeable as possible to his patients. His pupils were very numerous, and the school formed by them was called the Methodical. Asclepiades died at an advanced age from the effects of a fall.
