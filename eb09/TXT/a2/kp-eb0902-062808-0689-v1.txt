ARRACK, a name derived from the Arabic arak (perspiration), and applied to a spirituous liquor distilled in India, Ceylon, and Java, and generally consumed in Eastern countries. In Ceylon arrack is distilled from the fermented juice called toddy, drawn from the unexpanded flowerspathes of various palms, chiefly the Palmyra palm (Bor assus flabelliformis) and the cocoa palm (Cocos nucifera). On the Indian continent a kind of arrack is made from the flowers of the Muohwa tree (Bassia latifolia), besides that derived from palm toddy; and a large quantity of a nauseous and unpalatable spirit is distilled from rice, which goes by the name of rice arrack. This spirit is consumed by the lower orders and wild tribes of Bengal and Central India. In Java arrack is distilled from the impure molasses left in the manufacture of raw sugar, fermented with rice, to which a proportion of palm toddy is added. Large quantities of the deleterious spirit so prepared is shipped from Java to the countries of Northern Europe. The habitual use of these inferior liquors in the hot countries in which they are distilled is attended with most disastrous consequences.
