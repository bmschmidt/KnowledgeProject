ARISTIDES of Thebes, a celebrated Greek painter, was an older contemporary of Apelles, and flourished about 350 B.c. He is said by Pliny to have been the first to express in his paintings character and passion; but this is probably an exaggeration. Several of his paintings are recorded in which there was manifested extraordinary mastery of expression. His colouring is said by Pliny to have been hard.
