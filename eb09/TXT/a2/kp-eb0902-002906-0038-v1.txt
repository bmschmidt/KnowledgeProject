ANGILBERT, St, the most distinguished poet of his age, was the secretary and friend of Charlemagne. After filling the highest offices under that monarch, and receiving the hand Î´f his daughter Bertha in marriage, he retired in 790 to the monastery of Centule, or Saint Riquier, of which in 794 he was made abbot. He left this retreat from time to time when the king required his services, and in 800 assisted at Rome at his coronation. He died in 814. Angilbert was called by Charlemagne the Homer of his time.
