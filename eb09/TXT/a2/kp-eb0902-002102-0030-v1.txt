ANDRIA, a town of Italy, in the province of Terra di Bari, situated in a plain 31 miles west of Bari. The town, which is said to derive its name from the caverns (antra) in the vicinity, is well built, and possesses a fine cathedral, founded in 1046 by Petro Normano, count of Trani. It has no manufactures of importance, but there is an extensive trade in almonds, which are imported in large quantities from the surrounding country. Andria was burned [9:2:22] in 1799 by General Broussier, and in 1861 it became part of the new kingdom of Italy. Population, 34,000.
