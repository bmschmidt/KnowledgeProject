ANDERSON, Robert, an author and critic of considerable note in his own day, was born at Carnwath, Lanarkshire, on the 7th January 1750. He was at first destined for [9:2:15] the church, and was sent to the University of Edinburgh in 1707. After a few sessions, however, he quitted the divinity classes in order to study medicine. He was for a short time employed as surgeon to the dispensary at Bamborough Castle in Northumberland. Returning to Scotland he took the degree of M.D. at St Andrews, on the 20th of May 1778. He now began to practise as a physician at Alnwick; but his general habits were rather those of speculation than exertion, and a moderate provision, acquired by his marriage with the daughter of Mr John Gray, of Alnwick, had emancipated him from the necessity of professional labour. In 1784 he finally returned to Edinburgh, where he continued to reside till the close of his life. For several years his attention was occupied with his edition of The Works of the British Poets, with Prefaces Biographical and Critical (14 vols. 8vo, Edin. 1792-1807). His other publications were, The Miscellaneous Works of Tobias Smollett, M.D., with Memoirs of his Life and Writings (Edin. 1796); Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D., with Critical Observations on his Works (Edin. 1815); The Works of John Moore, M.D., with Memoirs of his Life and Writings (Edin. 1820); and The Grave and other Poems, by Robert Blair; to Ï„vhich are prefixed some Account of his Life and Observations on his Writings (Edin. 1826). Dr Anderson died on the 20th Feb. 1830.
