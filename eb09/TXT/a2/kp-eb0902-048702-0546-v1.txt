ARGENTEUIL, a market-town of France, in the department of Seine-et-Oise, and arrondissement of Versailles, on the Seine, in lat. 48° 56' N., long. 2° 15' E. It gathered round a monastery, which, dating from 656 A.D., was by Charlemagne changed into a nunnery, afterwards famous for its connection with Heloise, and on her expulsion in 1129, was again turned into a monastery. Francis L surrounded the town with walls and a ditch. The Chateau du Marais was once possessed by Mirabeau, and the parish church dates in some portions from the time of Clovis. Vinegar and an indifferent kind of wine are manufactured, and in the neighbourhood there are fine quarries of gypsum. Population, 8176.
