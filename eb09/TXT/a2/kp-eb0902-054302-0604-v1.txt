ARLON (Orolaunum in the Antonine Itinerary), the capital of the Belgian province of Luxemburg, is situated on a rising ground in the midst of a well-cultivated plain. It is a flourishing place of some 5000 or 6000 inhabitants, who are engaged in the manufacture of iron-wares, tobacco, crockery, and clay-pipes, and carry on a trade in grain. Antiquities found on the spot seem to indicate a Roman settlement. Under its present name the town is mentioned in 870. At one time an independent marquisate, it was united to the countship of Luxemburg in 1214. In the neighbourhood was the nunnery of Clairefontaine or Bardenburg, established about 1216, which is now a foundry.
