ARRIA, the wife of Caecina Paetus, who, having been engaged in the conspiracy of Scribonianus against the Emperor Claudius, 42 A.D., was condemned to death. Arria, resolving not to survive her husband, stabbed herself with a dagger, which she then handed to him with the words, “Paetus, it does not pain me.” Her daughter, also called Arria, was the wife of Thrasea; and when he was condemned to death by Nero, she would have imitated her mother’s example, but was dissuaded by her husband, who entreated her to live for the sake of their children. She was sent into banishment.
