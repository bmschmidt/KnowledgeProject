ARIAS MONTANUS, Benedictus, one of the most learned Oriental scholars of his time, and the editor of the Antwerp Polyglott, was born at Frescenal de la Sierra, in Estremadura, in 1527. After studying at the university of Alcala, he joined the Benedictine order. In 1562 he accompanied the bishop of Segovia to the Council of Trent. After a few years spent in retirement at Aracena he went to Antwerp, at the request of Philip IL, to edit the Polyglott Bible that had been projected by Plantin the printer. The work appeared in 8 volumes folio, between 1568 and 1573. The Jesuits founded on it several charges of heresy against Arias, from which he succeeded in clearing himself, though only after several visits to Rome. He declined the offer of a bishopric from the king, but after some time spent in retirement at Aracena, became librarian at the Escorial. The closing years of his life - were passed at Seville, where he died in 1598.
