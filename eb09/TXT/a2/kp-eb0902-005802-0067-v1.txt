ANJENGO, once a British factory and fortress, now a small sea-port town of India, in Travancore, nearly encircled by a deep and broad river, at the mouth of which it is situated. It lies in 8° 40' N. lat., 76° 49' E. long. The fort was built by the English in 1684, and retained till 1813, when the factory was abolished on account of the useless expense attending it. Anjengo is infested with snakes, scorpions, and centipedes, those animals finding shelter in the matted leaves of the cocoa-tree with which the houses are mostly thatched. Anjengo is celebrated for the best coir cables on the Malabar coast, manufactured from the fibre of the Laccadive cocoa-nut. It also exports pepper, cotton cloths, and drugs.
