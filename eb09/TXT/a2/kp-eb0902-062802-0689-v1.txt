ARNSTADT, an ancient town of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, in Central Germany, about 11 miles south of Erfurt, with which it is connected by rail. The Lieb-frauenkirche dates from the 12th century, and contains a number of interesting monuments. There is also a castle, a palace, a town-hall, a gymnasium, and a variety of charitable institutions. The so-called Giintherâ€™s Mill is worthy of notice. Leather, cloth, tobacco, weighing-machines, paper, playing cards, chairs, &c., are among the objects of its industry, and a trade is carried on in grain and wood. There are copper-mines in the neighbourhood, as well as tepid saline springs, the waters of which are used for bathing. Population, 8693.
