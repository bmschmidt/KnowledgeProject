ARNOBIUS, the younger, a Christian priest or bishop in Gaul, flourished about 460 a,d. He is the author of a mystical and allegorical commentary on the Psalms, first published by Erasmus in 1522, and by him attributed to the elder Arnobius. It has been frequently reprinted, and in the edition of De la Barre, 1580, is accompanied by some notes on the Gospels by the same author. To him has sometimes been ascribed the anti-Augustinian treatise Praedestinatus, which is anonymous. His opinions, as appears from the commentary, are semi-Pelagian.
