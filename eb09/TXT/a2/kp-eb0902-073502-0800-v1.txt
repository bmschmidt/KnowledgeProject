ASTARTE [Ashtaroth] was the chief goddess of the Phoenicians in Zidon, where was a temple in her honour. In Tyre also she had a temple, and from thence her worship was transplanted to Carthage. At what time it may have been introduced among the Jews is not known, but its power of attracting them may be seen by reference to 2 Kings xxiii. 13; 1 Kings xi. 5; Judges ii. 13. Among classical writers the usual epithet of Astarte was Coelestis or Urania, but while that distinguishes her only as a goddess of the heavens, it would seem that her name itself signifies “star.” Her symbol in her temple at Tyre was a star. Lucian (De Dea Syria, 4) expressly identifies her with Selene, the goddess of the moon; others, again, with the planet Venus. With the goddess Venus (Aphrodite), as worshipped at Paphos in Cyprus, Astarte had in common the character of a deity of the sky (Urania), and perhaps, also the patronage of immorality (“Ashtaroth, the abomination of the Zidonians,” 2 Kings xxiii. 13). The Romans, in calling her Juno Coelestis, appear to have been guided by her connection with Baal, and her position as queen of heaven. At the time of the 19th Egyptian dynasty Ashtaroth was introduced, with other Asiatic deities, into the religious system of the Egyptians, and had a temple at Memphis. But no representation of her occurs on the Egyptian monuments. The Assyrian goddess Ishtar seems to have been the same as Astarte (Movers, Die Phönizier, p. 601).
