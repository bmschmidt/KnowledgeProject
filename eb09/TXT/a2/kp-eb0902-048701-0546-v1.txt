ARGENTAN, a town in the department of Orne, in France, situated in the midst of a fertile plain at the junction of the Ure and Orne, about 31 miles from Alençon. It is a sub-prefecture, and the chief town of an arrondissement, and has an ancient castle, now used as a court-house and prison, several important churches, and a handsome townhouse. Its manufactures are a coarse kind of lace called after its name, gloves, leather, and fine cloth. Cattle and horses are reared. Argentan was a viscountship from the 11th century downwards; it has been often taken and destroyed; and during the religious wars it remained attached to the Catholic party. François-Eudes de Mézeray, the historian, was bom at Rie, in the neighbourhood. Population in 1872, 5725.
