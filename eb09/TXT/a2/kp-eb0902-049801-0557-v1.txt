ARGUS, in Greek Legend, the son of Agenor or Arestor, or, according to others, an earth-born hero (Autochthon). He was called Panoptes lgτavorrτg^), All-seeing, from having a hundred eyes. After performing several feats of valour, he was appointed by Juno to watch the cow into which Io had been transformed. While doing this he was slain by Mercury, who, according to one account, stoned him to death, according to another, put him to sleep by playing on the flute, and then cut off his head. His eyes were transferred by Juno to the tail of the peacock.
