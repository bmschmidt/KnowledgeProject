ANWARI, one of the earlier Persian poets, was born in Khorassan, in the 12th century. He enjoyed the especial favour of the Sultan Sandjar, whom he attended in all his warlike expeditions. On one occasion, when the sultan was besieging the fortress of Hazarasp, a fierce poetical conflict was maintained between Anwari and his rival Rasheedi, who was within the beleaguered castle, by means of verses fastened to arrows. Anwari died at Balkh about 1200. The Diwan, or collection of his poems, consists of a series of long poems, and a number of simpler lyrics. His longest piece, The Tears of Khorassan, translated into English verse by Captain Kirkpatrick, appeared in the Asiatic Miscellany.
