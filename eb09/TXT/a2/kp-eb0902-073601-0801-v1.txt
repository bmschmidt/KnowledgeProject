ASTERIUS, of Cappadocia, was a heathen sophist and teacher of rhetoric in Galatia. About the year 300 he was converted to Christianity, and became the disciple of Lucian, the founder of the school of Antioch. During the persecution in 304 he relapsed into Paganism, but was received again into the church by Lucian. He is best known as an able defender of the Arian doctrine, and was styled by Athanasius the “advocate” of the Arians. His chief work was the Syntagma, but he wrote many others, chiefly commentaries. Cf. Mountfaucon, Collectio Nova PP. et Script. Groec.
