ARNIM, Ludwig Achim von, a distinguished German poet and novelist, was born at Berlin in 1781. He studied at Vienna and Gottingen, and took the degree of M.D., though he never practised as a physician. His attention, however, in his early years seems to have been specially directed towards the natural sciences, and his first literary performance (Theorie der Elektrischen Erscheinungen) was in that department. But even in this essay he showed the fondness for the supernatural and the predilection for romance that appeared so strongly in his next work, Ariel’s Offenbarungen, 1804. In the same year he published Hallin’s Liebesleben, with an appendix containing a biography of Rousseau. He spent some years in travelling through parts of Germany and collecting old popular legends and songs. A selection of these he published at Heidelberg in conjunction with the poet Clemens Brentano, whose sister Bettina (noticed above) he afterwards married. The volumes, entitled Des Knaben Wunderhorn, were received with great favour. In 1809 he published the Wintergarten, a collection of tales; in 1810 an admirable novel, Die Gräfin Dolores; in 1811 a humorous dramatic romance, Halle und Jerusalem, and a novel, Isabelle von Aegypten ; and two years later his Schaubühne or dramatic pieces. His literary activity was for some time interrupted by the war in Germany, but in 1817 he published his last great romance, Die Kronenwachter, the scene of which is laid in the time of the Emperor Maximilian. Arnim died in 1831. His works have been published in a collected form at Berlin, 1839-1846. They manifest great originality of invention, but are for the most part marred by the utter absence of literary form, being vague, incoherent, and whimsical to the last degree. Arnim is the subject of a brilliant but much too favourable criticism in Heine’s De l’Allemagne.
