ANVIL, an iron block, with a smooth flat steel face, on which the malleable metals are hammered and shaped. They are of all sizes, from the tiny anvils used by the watchmaker to the ponderous masses employed in the arsenal of Woolwich. The common blacksmithâ€™s anvil is built up of six pieces welded to a central core, viz., four corner pieces, a projecting end, with a square hole for the reception of a chisel with its edge uppermost, and a conical end for hammering curved pieces of metal. These six pieces are first roughly welded to the core, and the whole is then thoroughly hammered and suitably shaped. A thin facing of steel is next welded on and carefully tempered; the surface of this is then ground perfectly flat, and, if need be, polished.
