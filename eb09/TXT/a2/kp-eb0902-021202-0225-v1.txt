APPRAISER (from ad and pretium, value), one who sets a value upon property, real or personal. By 46 George III. c. 43, appraisers must possess a license, the duty payable for which is at present Â£2 annually. By a statute of William and Mary, two sworn appraisers must be employed by the sheriff to value any goods taken under distress for rent. The business of appraiser is usually combined with that of auctioneer.
