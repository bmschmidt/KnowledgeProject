ARDFERT, a small village in Kerry, in the S.W. of Ireland, about 4 miles N.N.W. of Tralee, and nearly as much from the coast. It had at one time a university, and was the seat of a very ancient bishopric; but both it and Aghadoe, with which it was combined, are united to the see of Limerick. The cathedral, a very old building, was the church of St Brendanâ€™s monastery. A pillar tower, which stood near it, and was one of the finest and loftiest in the kingdom, fell in 1780. Population, 192.
