ANTIOCHUS III., surnamed the Great, was the son of Seleucus Callinicus, and ascended the Syrian throne at the age of fifteen, on the death of his brother, Seleucus Ceraunus. His reign embraced a series of wars against revolted provinces and neighbouring kingdoms, in the prosecution of which his disasters and successes were equally great. His march to India; his agreement with Philip of Macedonia for the partition of Egypt; his conquest of Palestine and Coele-Syria; his occupation of Asia Minor and the Thracian Chersonese; his collision with the Homans; his expedition into Greece, with the defeat at Thermopylae by Acilius Glabrio, and at Mount Sipylus (in Asia Minor) by Scipio; and his dearly purchased peace in 188 B.c., are the chief events of his life. He was killed in an attempt to plunder a temple at Elymais, 187 b.c., and was succeeded by his son Seleucus Philopator.
