ANNAMABOE, or Anamaboe, a British fort and town on the Gold Coast of Africa, about 10 miles E.N.E, of Cape Coast Castle. It exports palm oil, ivory, gold dust, pea nuts, and Guinea grains; and in return its imports of manufactured goods are considerable. The town suffered severely during the invasion of the Ashantees in 1807, but the fort, although garrisoned only by a few soldiers, resisted the whole Ashantee host. Population about 4500.
