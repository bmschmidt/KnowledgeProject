ARAGUAYA, or Araguia, a river of Brazil which rises in the Sierra Sciada, and flows north between the provinces of Matto Grosso and Goyaz till it joins the Tocantins at San Joao das duas Barras, about lat. 6° S. It divides into two branches in lat. 18° 30', and unites again about lat. 9° 30', thus forming the large island of Santa Anna or Bannanal. The eastern branch, called the Furo, is the one principally navigated. The most important tributaries are the Cristalino, the das Mortes, and the Caja, on the west, and the Claro, the Vermelho, the Cruxas, and the Chavantes, from the east. The whole course of the river is about 1000 miles, and it is navigable a long way up.
