ARTEMISIA, the sister and wife of Mausolus, king of Caria, immortalised herself by the honours which she paid to the memory of her husband. She built for him, in Halicarnassus, a very magnificent tomb, called the Mausoleum, which was one of the seven wonders of the world, and from which the name of Mausoleum was afterwards given to all tombs remarkable for their grandeur; but she died of regret and sorrow before it was finished. She appointed panegyrics to be made in honour of him, and proposed prizes of great value for the best oratorical and tragic compositions. She also erected a monument, or trophy, in Rhodes to commemorate her conquest of that island. When the Rhodians regained their freedom they built round this trophy so as to render it inaccessible, whence it was known as the aβaτov. She died about 350 B.c.
