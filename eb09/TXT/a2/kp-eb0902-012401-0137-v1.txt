ANTIBES, a seaport town of France, on the Mediterranean, in the arrondissement of Grasse, which formerly belonged to the department of Var, but which was transferred to the new department of Alpes Maritimes in 1860. The town is situated on the east side of a neck of land called La Garoupe, 10 miles S.E. of Grasse; it is fortified, and possesses a tolerable harbour, which accommodates a considerable fishing industry. The principal exports are dried fruits, salt fish, and oil. The surrounding country is very fertile, producing abundance of fruit and flowers. Antibes, the ancient Antipolis, was founded by colonists from Marseilles about 340 B.c. Population, 6004.
