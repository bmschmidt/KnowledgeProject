ANDREWS, James Pettit, an English historian and miscellaneous writer, was the younger son of Joseph Andrews, of Shaw-house, near Newbury, Berks, where he was born in 1737. He was educated privately, and early discovered a taste for literature and the fine arts. Andrews was the author of several miscellaneous works, but his most extensive undertaking was his History of Great Britain, connected ιυith the Chronology of Europe, with Notes, &c., of which, however, he lived to complete but two volumes. The first, which was published in 1794, in 4to, commences with Caesar’s invasion, and ends with the deposition and death of Richard II.; and the second, which appeared in 1795, continues the history to the accession of Edward VI. The plan of this work was new, and in some respects singular; a portion of the history of England is given on one page, and a general sketch of the contemporaneous history of Europe on the page opposite. He appears to have left off this work to prepare a continuation of Henry’s History of Britain, which he published in 1796 in one volume 4to, and two volumes 8vo. He died at Brompton 6th August 1797.
