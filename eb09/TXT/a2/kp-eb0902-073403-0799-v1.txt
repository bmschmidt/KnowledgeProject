ASSYRIA. The two great empires which grew up on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates can be separated as little historically as geographically. It is proposed, therefore, to treat both under the heading Babylonia. From the beginning their history is closely intertwined; and the power of the one is a measure of the weakness of the other. This interdependence of Assyrian and Babylonian history was recognised by ancient writers, and has been confirmed by modern discovery. But whereas Assyria takes the first place in the classical accounts to the exclusion of Babylonia, the decipherment of the inscriptions has proved that the converse was really the case, and that, with the exception of some six or seven centuries, Assyria might be described as a province or dependency of Babylon. Not only was Babylonia the mother country, as the tenth chapter of Genesis explicitly states, but the religion and culture, the literature and the characters in which it was contained, the arts and the sciences of the Assyrians were derived from their southern neighbours. Both had the same population and spoke the same language. In accordance, therefore, with the evidence of the native monuments, Assyria will be treated in connection with Babylonia. With all the similarity, however, there were, of course, certain differences in the character and development of the two countries. These differences will be carefully noted, and subjects which peculiarly belong to either the one or the other empire will be fully and separately dealt with. (See Babylonia.) [9:2:735]
