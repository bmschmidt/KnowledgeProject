ARNISAeUS, Hennin gus, a German physician, was born at Halberstadt, probably about 15S0. After completing his studies at the university of Helmstadt and taking his degree as doctor of medicine, he seems to have lectured for some time on moral philosophy at Frankfurt-on-the-Oder. In 1613 he was appointed one of the professors of medicine at Helmstadt, and he is said to have constructed there a chemical laboratory and a botanical garden. His anatomical plates were very celebrated, and some of them were extant in the time of Haller. In 1620 he was made court physician to Christian IV. of Denmark, and removed to Copenhagen, where he died in 1638. The greater number of his extant works are on the theory of politics, such as Doctrina Politica, published after his death, De Pepublica, De jure Majestatis, &c.; the following medical tracts are ascribed to him, Disquisitiones de partus humani legitimis terminis and Disputatio de lue venerea.
