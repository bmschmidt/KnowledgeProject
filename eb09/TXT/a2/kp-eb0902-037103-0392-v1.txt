ARCHELAUS, a general of Mithridates, commanded his army in the war against the Romans. He was sent into Greece with an army of 120,000, and after three days’ fighting with Bruttius Sura, occupied the Piraeus. Here he was attacked by Sulla, and after a hard struggle was compelled to withdraw into Boeotia. Sulla followed, and at Chaeronea, 86 b.c., completely routed him. A fresh army was sent by Mithridates, but at Orchomenos, after a two days’ battle, Archelaus was again defeated. Peace was soon afterwards concluded, but as Archelaus found that he had incurred the displeasure of Mithridates, he fled over to the Romans, by whom he was well received. He is not heard of again in history, but several of his descendants of the same name held high posts under Pompey, Antony, and Augustus.
