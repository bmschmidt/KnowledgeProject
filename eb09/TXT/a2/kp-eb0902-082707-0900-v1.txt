ATHALIAH, the daughter of Ahab and wife of Jeho-ram, king of Judah, who, after the death of King Ahaziah, her son, caused all the male members of the royal house of Judah to be massacred, in order that she might usurp the throne. Among the victims were her own grandchildren, except the youngest, Joash, who was concealed in the temple by his aunt, Jehosheba, wife of the high priest, Jehoiada. After six years Jehoiada organised a successful revolution in favour of Joash, and caused Athaliah to be put to death by the Levitical guards (2 Kings xi.; 2 Chron. xxii. 10-12, xxiii.) The story of Athaliah forms the subject of one of Racineâ€™s best tragedies. It has been musically treated by Handel and Mendelssohn.
