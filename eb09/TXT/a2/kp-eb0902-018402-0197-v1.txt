APOLLINARIS SIDONIUS, Caius Sollius, an eminent Christian writer and bishop, was born in Lyons about 430 a.d. Belonging to a noble family he was educated under the best masters, and particularly excelled in poetry and polite literature. He married Papianilla, the daughter of Avitus, who was consul, and afterwards emperor, by whom he had three children. But Majorianus, in the year 457, having deprived Avitus of the empire, and taken the city of Lyons, Apollinaris fell into the hands of the enemy. The reputation of his learning led Majorianus to treat him with the greatest respect; in return for which Apollinaris composed a panegyric in his honour, which was so highly applauded, that he had a statue erected to him at Rome, and was honoured with the title of Count. In 467 the Emperor Anthemius rewarded him for the panegyric which he had written in honour of him, by raising him to the post of governor of Rome, and afterwards to the dignity of a patrician and senator. But he soon quitted these secular [9:2:185] employments for the service of the church; and, in 472, was chosen to succeed Eparchius in the bishopric of Clermont. On the capture of that city by the Goths in 480 he was obliged to retire, as he had taken an active part in its defence; but he was soon restored by Evaric, king of the Goths, and continued to govern the church as before. He died 482 or 484 a.d. His extant works are his Panegyrics on different emperors, and a collection of Letters and Poems, and their chief value consists in the light they shed on the political and literary history of the 5th century. The best edition is that by Sirmond, published in 1614, and republished in 1652.
