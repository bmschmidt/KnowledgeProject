ASHBY-DE-LA-ZOUCH, a market-town of England, county of Leicester, 17 miles north-west of Leicester, on the railway from that city to Burton. The town, which derives the adjunct to its name from the Norman family of La Zouch, consists principally of one long street. It contains six churches and chapels, and has a grammar school and several charity schools. The church of St Helen is a fine old building, containing the tombs of the Huntingdon family, and a “finger pillory.” The Ivanhoe baths, erected in 1826, are much frequented for their saline waters, which, as containing bromine, are found useful in scrofulous and rheumatic complaints. To the south of the town are the extensive remains of Ashby Castle, built in 1480 by Sir William Hastings, ancestor of the earls of Huntingdon, who was created baron of Ashby-de-la-Zouch in 1461. It was one of the castles in which Mary Queen of Scots was confined. Population (1871), 7302, principally engaged in the manufacture of stockings, leather, malt, and firebricks, or in the coal and iron mines of the vicinity.
