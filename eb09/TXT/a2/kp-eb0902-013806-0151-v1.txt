ANTONIDES, Hans [Jan Van der Goes], a Dutch poet, was born April 3, 1647, at Goes, in Zealand, of poor but respectable parents. They removed to Amsterdam when he was about four years old, and he there enjoyed the tuition of Hadrian Junius, and James Cocceius. He was only nineteen when he attracted attention by his tragedy, Trazil, of overrompelt Sinaâ€” Trazil, or the Conquest of China. The venerable Vondel called him his son, and said he would have been proud of being the author of his Bellone aan Band. His parents designed him for an [9:2:139] apothecary; but Buisero, one of the lords of the admiralty at Amsterdam, defrayed his college expenses, and enabled him to take the degree of doctor of physic. He practised with success, and established his poetic fame by his Ystroom, an epic on the river Y. He died on the 18th of September 1664. Hie writings are remarkable for their warmth of fancy and vigour of expression, which sometimes degenerate into extravagance and bombast. His complete works were printed at Amsterdam in 1714, 4to, with a sketch of his life.
