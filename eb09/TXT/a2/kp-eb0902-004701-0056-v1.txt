ANGUSSOLA, or Angosciola, Sophonisba, one of the best portrait painters of the latter half of the 16th century, was born at Cremona in 1533, and died at Genoa in 1620. In 1560, at the invitation of Philip II., she visited the court of Madrid, where her portraits elicited great commendation. Vandyck is said to have declared that he had derived more knowledge of the true principles of his art from her conversation than from any other source. She painted several fine portraits of herself, one of which is now at Althorp. A few specimens of her painting are to be seen at Florence and Madrid. She had three sisters, who were also celebrated artists.
