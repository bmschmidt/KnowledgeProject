ARABICI, a sect originating about the beginning of the 3d century, which is mentioned by Augustine (De Haeres., c. 83), and called also Thnetopsychztoe by Johannes Damascenus (De H<xÏ„es., c. 99). Its founder is unknown, and its history brief and obscure. Its distinctive doctrine was a form of Christian materialism, showing itself in the belief that the soul perished and was restored to life along with the body. According to Eusebius, the Arabici were convinced of their error by Origen, and renounced it at a council held about 246 a.d.
