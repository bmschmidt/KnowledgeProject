APT, the Roman Apta Julia, a town of France, in the department of Vaucluse, situated on the left bank of the Calavon, a tributary of the Durance, 30 miles east of Avignon. It is surrounded by ancient and massive walls, and is well built, although several of its streets are narrow and irregular. The chief object of interest is the cathedral, a building combining different styles of architecture, founded about the year 1050 on the site of a much older edifice, but not completed until the latter half of the 17th century. There are many Roman remains in and near the town, including a fine bridge, which is said to have been constructed by Julius Caesar. The chief manufactures of Apt are those of woollen and cotton goods, silk, confectionery, earthenware, candles, leather, and brandy; and there is besides a considerable trade in fruit, grain, and cattle. Apt was at one time the chief town of the Vulgientes, a Gallic tribe; it was destroyed by Julius Caesar, who subsequently restored it, conferring upon it the title Julia; it was much injured by the Lombards and the Saracens, but its fortifications were rebuilt by the counts of Provence. Population (1872), 5892.
