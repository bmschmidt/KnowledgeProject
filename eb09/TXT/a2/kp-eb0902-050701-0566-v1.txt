ARISTO, or Ariston, of Chios, a Stoic philosopher and pupil of Zeno, flourished about 250 B.c. He differed from Zeno on many points, and approximated more closely to the Cynic school. He was very eloquent (and was therefore sometimes called the Siren), but was controversial in tone. He despised logic as useless, and rejected the philosophy of nature as beyond the powers of man. Ethics alone he considered worthy of study, and in that only general and theoretical questions. He rejected altogether Zeno’s doctrine of things desirable and intermediate between virtue and vice. According to him, there is no medium; everything that is not virtuous {e.g., external conditions, fortune, health), is absolutely indifferent. There is only one virtue—a clear, intelligent, healthy disposition of mind. Aristo is frequently confounded with another philosopher of the same name, Ariston of Julis, in Ceos, who, about 230 B.C., succeeded Lyco as scholarch of the Peripatetics. He appears to have been a man of no weight or originality of mind.
