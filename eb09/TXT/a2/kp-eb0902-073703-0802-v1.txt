ASTORGA (the ancient Asturica Augusta), a city of Spain, in the province of Leon, in a plain near the Tuento. It confers the title of marquis on the Osorio family, the ruins of whose palace, destroyed in 1810 by the French, are still an object of interest. It is surrounded with ancient Roman fortifications, which now afford a pleasant promenade; and there is in the vicinity a ruined castle. It was formerly called the “city of priests,” from the great numbers of that profession resident within its walls; and it is still the see of a bishop under the church of Compostella, and has a Gothic cathedral of the 15th century.
