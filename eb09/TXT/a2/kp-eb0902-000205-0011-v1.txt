ANAXIMENES, a Greek historian and rhetorician, was born at Lampsacus, in Asia Minor, in the 4th century b.c. He accompanied Alexander, whom he is said to have instructed in rhetoric, on his expedition against Persia. He wrote a history of Philip and of Alexander, and likewise twelve books on the early history of Greece, but only a very few fragments of these exist. The treatise ’Ρητορική προς ’Αλέξανδρον, usually included among the works of Aristotle, has been ascribed by many critics to Anaximenes, on grounds that are generally admitted to be conclusive.
