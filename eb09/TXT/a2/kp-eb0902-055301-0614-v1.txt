ARMORICA. The Armorici were, in Caesar’s time, the Celtic inhabitants of the coast from the Loire to the Seine. The word appears to be composed of “ar,” near, and “morf the sea, and would originally be applicable to any maritime population. It is said to be akin to “Morini,” and “Pomerania” (Po-more). In the Middle Ages the name Armorica was still further narrowed into an equivalent for Brittany.
