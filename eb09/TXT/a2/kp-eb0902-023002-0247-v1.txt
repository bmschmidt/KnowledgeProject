AQUILA (Άκυλα?), a native of Pontus, who flourished about 130 a.d., celebrated for his translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek. His history is involved in much obscurity; but, according to Epiphanius {De Pond, et Mens., c. 15), he was a kinsman of the Emperor Hadrian, who employed him in rebuilding Jerusalem (Aelia Capitolina), and was converted to Christianity, but on being reproved for practising the pagan astrology, apostatised to Judaism. This account, however, is more than doubtful. Aquila’s version of the Scriptures w as exceedingly close and accurate, and is said to have been used in place of the Septuagint in the synagogues. Though the Christians generally disliked it, alleging without due grounds that it rendered the Messianic passages incorrectly, Jerome and Origen speak in its praise. The few fragments that remain are published in the Hexaj)la of Origen, and in Dathe’s 0ρ≡cWα, Lips. 1746.
