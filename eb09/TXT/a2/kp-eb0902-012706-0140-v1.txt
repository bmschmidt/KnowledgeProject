ANTIGONE (2), in Greek legend, the daughter of Eurytion, king of Phthia, who gave her in marriage to Peleus, the issue being a daughter, Polydora. Peleus having, accidentally killed Eurytion in a hunt, some say the hunt of the Calydonian boar, fled and obtained expiation from Acastus, whose wife in malice, because her affection for Peleus was not returned, informed Antigone that it was, upon which Antigone took her own life.
