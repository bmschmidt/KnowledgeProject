ARBOGA, an ancient town in Sweden, in the government of Westerns, 30 miles S.W. of Westerns, on a river of the same name as itself, near its junction with the canal which joins the Malar and Hielmar Lakes. It was formerly a place of great trade, and contained five churches, three monasteries, and four chapels; but, though there is still some traffic in woollen, iron, and wooden wares, its prosperity has greatly decreased. It is well known as tho seat of several important assemblies; particularly the parliaments of 1434, 1440, and 1471; and that of 1561, when the estates accepted the “Arboga articles,” by which Eric XIV. restrained the power of his brothers. The town gives its name to the coinage of 1625 and 1627, which consisted of Jdiρpingar i or square copper pieces, and fyrkar, or farthings. In the neighbourhood there are mineral springs. Population, 3269.
