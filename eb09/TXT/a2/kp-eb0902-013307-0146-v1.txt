ANTIOCHUS, of Ascalon, a philosopher of the 1st century before Christ, who, coming under the influence of Philo the Academic and of Mnesarchus the Stoic, was led to attempt a reconciliation between their antagonistic doctrines, and thus gave rise to what has been called the Fifth Academy. In regard to the great question of the degree of certainty attainable by man, he held, in opposition to the scepticism of Philo, that the human intellect has in itself a sufficient test of truth; and in regard to the question wherein happiness consists, he maintained that, while virtue was the greatest essential, the circumstances of life were not a matter of indifference. Of his writings none have been preserved to us; and for tho greater part of our information we are indebted to Cicero, who had studied under him at Athens, and continued to keep up a friendly intercourse with him afterwards. He visited Alexandria and Rome, and lectured on philosophy in both cities.
