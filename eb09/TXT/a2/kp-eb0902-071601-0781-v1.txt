ASPINWALL, or Colon, a city and free port on the northern coast of Panama, one of the united states of Colombia. It is built on the well-wooded coral island of Manzanilla, inlat. 9° 22' 53'' N., and long. 79° 52' 58" W., owes its origin to the Panama Railway Company, who founded it (1850) for the convenience of their traffic, and derives its more usual name from W. H. Aspinwall, one of their principal shareholders. In spite of the unhealthiness of its situation,—now, indeed, largely diminished,—and the dangerous winds from the north to which it is at some seasons exposed, it has quite superseded the neighbouring port of Chagres, and become the centre of a considerable local trade. The banana, especially, is cultivated in the neighbourhood and largely exported to New York. The population, composed mainly of Jamaica and Spanish negroes, was stated at 6500 in 1872. A telegraph line extends from Aspinwall to Kingston in Jamaica.
