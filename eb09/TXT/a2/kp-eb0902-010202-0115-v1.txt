ANTENOR, a Trojan elder of great prudence, who advised his fellow-townsmen to send Helen back to her husband, and in various ways showed himself not unfriendly to the Greeks. In the Homeric poems there is no intimation of this disposition having led him into any breach of his natural allegiance; but in the later development of the romance he appears as a full-blown traitor, and in the general sack of the city his house, distinguished by a pantherâ€™s skin at the door, is spared by the victors in reward of his treachery. He afterwards, according to various versions of the legend, either rebuilt a city on the site of Troy, or settled at Cyrene, or became the founder of Padua (Patavium) and several other towns in Eastern Italy.
