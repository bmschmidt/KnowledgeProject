PRAM, Christen Henriksen (1756-1821), Scandinavian poet, was born in Gudbrandsdal, Norway, in 1756, and educated in Copenhagen, where in 1781 he received an appointment in the chamber of commerce, which gave him considerable leisure for literature. In 1785 he pub-slished Staerkodder, a romantic epic based on some of the old Scandinavian legends, in fifteen cantos, and in the same year he began to edit Minerva, a journal of some influence in Danish literature. He also wrote two tragedies (Damon and Pythias and Frode and Fingal), several comedies, and a number of tales characterized by brightness and humour. In 1819 he removed to the West-Indian island of St Thomas, where he died on 25th November 1821. His select poetical works were afterwards edited, with a biography, by his friend K. L. Rahbek (6 vols., 1824-29). Compare Denmark, vol. vii. p. 91.
