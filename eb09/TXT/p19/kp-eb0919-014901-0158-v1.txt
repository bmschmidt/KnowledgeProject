PITTACUS of Mytilene in Lesbos, one of the seven sages of Greece, was born in 651 B.c. His father Hyrradius (or Caicus) was a Thracian, his mother was a Lesbian. About 611 b.c. Pittacus, along with the brothers of the poet Alcaeus, overthrew Melanchrus, tyrant of Lesbos. In a war between the Mytilenians and Athenians for the possession of the town of Sigeum on the Hellespont, Pittacus, as general of the Mytilenians, slew the Athenian commander Phrynon in single combat, having entangled him in a net (606 B.C.). In 589 his fellowcitizens entrusted Pittacus with despotic power for the purpose of protecting them against the exiled nobles, at the head of whom were Alcaeus and Antimenides. Pittacus effected this object, and, without introducing a new constitution, contrived by legislation to restore the existing constitution to regular working order. One of his laws enacted that offences committed during intoxication should be punished with double severity. For the historian of the law of inheritance some interest attaches to the enactment of Pittacus that father and mother should succeed, in equal shares, to the property of a deceased child. He resigned the government after holding it for ten years, and died ten years later (569 B.C.).

The stories which bring Pittacus and Croesus into connexion are probably mere legend, since Croesus was only twenty-five years of age at the date of Pittacus’s death. Pittacus was regarded as a pattern of all the virtues, and this high character is borne out by what we know of him. When Alcaeus, who had bitterly assailed him in his poems, fell into his hands, he let him go, saying that forgiveness was better than revenge. Of the lands which his grateful countrymen would have bestowed on him he accepted only a small part. Amongst the sayings attributed to him are these :— it is hard to be good; rule reveals the man; the best rule is that of law; speak ill neither of friend nor foe. Pittacus was also a poet; Diogenes Laertius states that he composed six hundred elegiac verses.
