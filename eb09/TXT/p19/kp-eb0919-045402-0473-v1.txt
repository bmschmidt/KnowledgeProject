PONTECORVO, a city of Italy in the province of Caserta, on the left bank of the Garigliano, with a population of 5172 in 1881 (commune 10,191), answers to the ancient Fregellae, a Volscian city, colonized in 323 B.c. by the Romans, who thus occasioned the Second Samnite War. The principality of Pontecorvo (about 40 square miles in extent), which Napoleon bestowed on Bernadotte in 1806, was in 1810 incorporated with the French empire.
