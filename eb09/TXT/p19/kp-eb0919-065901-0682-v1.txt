PRAHRAN, a city of Victoria, Australia, is situated about 3∣ miles south-east of Melbourne, with which it is connected by the Melbourne and Brighton Railway, and by road over a fine iron girder bridge which crosses the Yarra. It is a well-built city, with handsome shops and numerous villas. Among the public buildings are the town-hall, with a lofty tower, containing the rooms of the free library, and the mechanics’ institute. There are a number of charitable institutions. Prahran was created a municipality in 1856, a borough in 1863, and a city in 1879. The area of the city is 2320 acres, with a population in 1881 of 21,169.
