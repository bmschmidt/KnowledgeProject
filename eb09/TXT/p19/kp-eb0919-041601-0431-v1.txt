POLYCLETUS. Two Greek sculptors bore this name. For an account of the works of the elder, a native of Sicyon, see vol. ii. p. 357, and figs. 6,7. With him is sometimes confounded his younger kinsman and namesake, properly known as Polycletus the Argive. For the most part this younger Polycletus confined himself to statues of athletes who had won prizes at Olympia. In recent excavations there two bases of statues by him have been found, but no remains of his work. From the fact of his having executed a statue of Zeus Philios, i.e., a combination of Zeus and Dionysus, for the town of Megalopolis, which was founded in 371 B.c., we may assign him to about that date.
