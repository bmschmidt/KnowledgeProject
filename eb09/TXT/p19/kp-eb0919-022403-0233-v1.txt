PLEYEL, Ignaz Joseph (1757-1831), though now almost forgotten, was once one of the most popular composers in Europe. He was born at Ruppersthal, near Vienna, June 1, 1757, studied the pianoforte under Van Hal (known in England as Vanhall), and learned composition from Haydn, who became his dearest friend. He was appointed maître de chapelle at Strasburg in 1783; and in 1791 he was invited to London, where, though Haydn was also there, he achieved an immense success. On his return to Strasburg he narrowly escaped the guillotine; but, after proving that he was not an aristocrat, he was permitted to remain until 1795, when he migrated to Paris. Here he opened a large music shop, published the first complete edition of Haydn’s quartette, and founded, in 1807, the pianoforte manufactory which still bears his name. He died at Paris, November 14, 1831.

PleyeΓs compositions are very numerous, but it is only in the earlier ones that the fire of true genius is discernible. His daughter-in-law, Maria Pleyel,— née Moke (1811-1875), and wife of his eldest son, Camille,—was one of the most accomplished pianistes of the age.
