PORT JERVIS, a large village of the United States, in Deerpark township, Orange county, New York, situated at the intersection of the boundaries of New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, at the junction of the Neversink with the Delaware. It is the terminus of the eastern division of the New York, Lake Erie, and Western Railroad, and of the Port Jervis and Monticello Railroad, and it has extensive repair-shops. The beauty of the surrounding scenery attracts summer visitors. Port Jervis was named after John B. Jervis, engineer of the Delaware and Hudson Canal, which connects the Pennsylvanian coal-fields with the tidal waters of the Hudson. In 1875 the Erie Railway bridge, the Barrett bridge, and many buildings were carried away by an icegorge. The population of the village was 6377 in 1870, and 8678 in 1880 (township 11,420).
