POTTSVILLE, a city of the United States, capital of Schuylkill county, Pennsylvania, lies 35 miles north-west of Reading, on the north side of the Schuylkill river, in the gap by which it breaks through Sharp Mountain. It is the terminus of the main line of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, and the great emporium of the Schuylkill coal region, which extends north and east and west, and has an annual yield of about 6,000,000 tons. Furnaces, rolling-mills, machine-shops, planing-mills, a spikemill, a pottery, <fcc., are among the industrial establishments; and the public institutions include a court-house, a jail, a town-hall, a union hall, an opera-house, a childrenâ€™s home, a lyceum, and a free reading-room. The German and Welsh elements in the population are strong enough to be represented each by several churches. Pottsville as a city dates from 1825. In 1850 it had 7515 inhabitants, 12,384 in 1870, and 13,253 in 1880.
