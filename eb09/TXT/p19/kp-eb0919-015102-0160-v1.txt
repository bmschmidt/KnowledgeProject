PITTSTON, a borough of the United States, in Luzerne county, Pennsylvania, on the east bank of the Susquehanna, just below the confluence of the Lackawanna, 105 miles north by west of Philadelphia. It is the centre of the Wyoming anthracite region and the seat of the Pennsylvania Coal Companyâ€™s operations, contains knitting mills, planing mills, terra cotta works, a stove factory, lumber yards, &c., and commands four distinct railway lines. The population was 6760 in 1870 and 7472 in 1880. If West Pittston (a borough on the other side of the Susquehanna, with which Pittston communicates by two bridges) were included, the total would be 10,016.
