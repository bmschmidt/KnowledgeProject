POPE is the name given in England to a small freshwater perch (Acerina cernua), also called Ruffe, which is generally distributed in the rivers of central Europe and common in most fresh waters of England. It was first made known by Dr Caius, a keen observer who lived in the middle of the 16th century, and is well known by his work De Canibus Britannicis. He found the fish in the river Yar, and figured it under the name of Aspredo, the Latin translation of ruffe, which name refers to the remarkable roughness of the scales with which it is covered. In general structure, shape, and habits the pope resembles much the common perch, but rarely exceeds a length of seven inches, and differs in its coloration, which is olivebrown with irregular darker spots on the body and numerous blackish dots on the dorsal and caudal fins. It is most destructive to the fry of other fish, but in many parts of the country is esteemed as food. It spawns generally in the month of April.
