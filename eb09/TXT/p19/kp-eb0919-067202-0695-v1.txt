PRERAU (Slav. PreroÏ…), one of the oldest towns in Moravia, lies on the Beczwa, 13 miles to the south-east of Ohniitz. It is an important railway junction and carries on a considerable trade. The chief industries are sugar-boiling (from beetroot), rope-making, and the manufacture of agricultural and other machinery. The only buildings of interest are the old castle, once occupied by Matthias Corvinus, and the Gothic town-house. The population in 1880 was 10,985.
