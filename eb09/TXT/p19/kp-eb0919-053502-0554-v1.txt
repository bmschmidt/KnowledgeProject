PORTSMOUTH, a city of the United States, capital of Scioto county, Ohio, lies at the confluence of the Scioto with the Ohio, and is the southern terminus of the Ohio and Erie Canal, and of a branch line of the Cincinnati, Washington, and Baltimore Railroad (Hamden to Portsmouth, 56 miles), as well as an important station on the Scioto Valley Railway. As the entrepot for the rich mineral regions of southern Ohio and north-eastern Kentucky, and for the productive valley of the Scioto, Portsmouth has a large and growing trade both by rail and river; and it also contains iron-furnaces, rolling-mills, foundries, saw-mills, planing-mills, breweries, flour-mills, shoe-factories, hub and spoke factories, &c. Among the public buildings are an opera-house and a masonic temple. The charitable institutions include a hospital, a childrenâ€™s home, and a home for destitute aged women. The city has also two libraries, water-works, and tramways. The population was 6268 in 1860, 10,592 in 1870, and 11,321 in 1880. Portsmouth was laid out in 1803, and the charter of the city dates from 1814.
