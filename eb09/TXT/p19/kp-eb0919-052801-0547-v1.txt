PORT HOPE, a town and port of entry of Canada, in Durham county, Ontario, on the north shore of Lake Ontario, lies 63 miles north-east of Toronto by the Grand Trunk Railway (which is there met by the midland branch of the Grand Trunk Railway), and is connected with Charlotte, the port of Rochester, New York, by a daily steamboat service. The town is picturesquely situated on the side and at the foot of hills overlooking the lake; and Smithâ€™s Creek, by which it is traversed, supplies abundant water-power. Flour, plaster, woollen goods, leather, beer, carriages, agricultural implements, and steam-engines and boilers are among the objects of the local industries, and trade is carried on in lumber, grain, and flour. The value of the exports was $1,326,706 in the year ending 30th June 1884, and that of the imports $221,830. The population in 1881 was 5585.
