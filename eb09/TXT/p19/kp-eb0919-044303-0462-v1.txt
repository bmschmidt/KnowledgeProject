POMONA, the old Roman goddess of tree-fruits (poma). Ovid (Met., xiv. 623 sq.~) tells how she was loved by the silvan deities, the satyrs, pans, &c., and how Vertumnus, god of the turning year, wooed and won the shy goddess. Corresponding to Pomona there seems to have been a male Italian deity called Puemunus, who was perhaps identical with Vertumnus. At Rome Pomona had a special priest, the flamen Pomonalis, who ranked lowest among the fifteen flamens. About 12 miles from Rome on the way to Ostia there was a Pomonal, or place (perhaps grove) sacred to Pomona. She was also worshipped in the neighbourhood of Amiternum.
