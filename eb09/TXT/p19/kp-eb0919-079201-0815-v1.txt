PROCOPIUS. Two leaders of this name are mentioned in connexion with the wars of the Hussites (q.v.).

I. Andreas Procopius, surnamed “the Great ” or “the Bald,” was a native of Bohemia, born about 1380. He had travelled extensively in Europe, and had even visited Jerusalem before he received priestly orders. On the outbreak of the Hussite War he joined Zizka, and was chosen to succeed him after his death in 1425. From 1426 onwards he met with a succession of military successes in Austria, Moravia, Silesia, and Hungary which compelled various potentates to purchase peace, and disposed even the council of Basel to a spirit of compromise. Procopius and his “Taborites” were, however, dissatisfied with the “Coinpactata” which the “Calixtines” accepted, and resolved to carry on the contest. He perished in the decisive battle fought near Böhmischbrod on May 30, 1434.

II. Of Procopius surnamed “the Little” nothing is known save that he co-operated with Procopius “the Great” from 1427 onwards, and that he shared his fate.
