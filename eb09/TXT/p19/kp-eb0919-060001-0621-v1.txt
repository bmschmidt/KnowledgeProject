POTTER, John (c. 1674-1747), archbishop of Canterbury, was the son of a linen-draper at Wakefield, Yorkshire, and was born about 1674. At the age of fourteen he entered University College, Oxford, and in 1693 he published, at the suggestion of the master of his college, various readings and notes on Plutarch’s De audiendis poetis and Basil’s Oratio ad juvenes. In 1694 he became a fellow of Lincoln College, and in 1697 his edition of Lycophron appeared. It was followed by his Archveologia Grseca (2 vols. 8vo, 1697-99), once a very popular work. A reprint of his Lycophron in 1702 was dedicated to Graevius, and the Antiquities was afterwards published in Latin in the Thesaurus of Gronovius. In 1704 he became chaplain to Archbishop Tenison, and shortly afterwards was made chaplain - in ≡∙ ordinary to Queen Anne. From 1708 he was regius professor of divinity and canon of Christ Church, Oxford; and from 1715 he was bishop of Oxford. In the latter year appeared his edition of Clemens Alexandrinus (frequently reprinted and still valued). In 1707 he published a Discourse on Church Government, and he took a prominent part in the controversy with Hoadly, bishop of Bangor, being complimented by that author as the antagonist of whom he was most afraid. In January 1737 Potter was unexpectedly appointed to succeed Wake in the see of Canterbury. His primacy was in no way remarkable, but had the effect of checking the movement for revision of the formularies and confessions of the church and of the subscription to them. He died on 10th October 1747. His Theological Works, consisting of sermons, charges, divinity lectures, and the Discourse on Church Government, were published in 3 vols. 8vo, in 1753.
