PLASENCIA, a city of Spain and an episcopal see, in the north of the province of Caceres (Estremadura), is pleasantly situated on the right bank of the Xerte or Jerte, a sub-tributary of the Tagus, and at the foot of the sierras of Bejar and Vera, continuations of the Guadarrama range. Industrially and commercially insignificant, the place has some interest for the artist and ecclesiologist on account of its fine walls, built in 1197 by Alphonse VIII. of Castile, and of its cathedral, begun in 1498, which is a favourable specimen of the ornate Gothic of its period, and also shows good examples of the workmanship of Berruguete, Aleman, and other artists. The population of the ayuntamiento was 7090 in 1877. The Hieronymite convent of Yuste, the scene of the last years of the emperor Charles V., lies about 2 4 miles to the westward, and is most conveniently reached from Plasencia.
