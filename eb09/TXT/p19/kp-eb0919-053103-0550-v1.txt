PORTO BELLO (Span., Puerto Bello), a town in the republic of Colombia and state of Panamâ, situated on the coast of the Caribbean Sea, about 23 miles east of Colon in 9° 32' N. lat. and 78° 38' W. long. As the name (bestowed by Columbus in 1502) implies, it possesses a fine natural harbour, the bay between Drake’s Point in the north and Buenaventura Island in the south being easy of entrance and having a depth of 8 to 16 fathoms. Founded in 1584, the city rapidly grew in importance, becoming the great depot for the gold and silver from Peru, which were brought across the isthmus from Panamâ, and here conveyed on board the royal galleons. It is now best remembered through the unexpected success which attended Admiral Vernon’s attack in 1739. “Within forty-eight hours after his appearance in the harbour” he was in possession of the place, and before he left he utterly destroyed the fortifications. At that time the city contained about 10,000 inhabitants; it now barely numbers 1000, including the Negroes, who live in the quarter known as Guinea. A few public buildings, such as the principal church and the treasury, remain as indications of former prosperity. The decline is due much less to Admiral Vernon than to the extreme unhealthiness of the situation, and the fact that trade has taken to quite other channels.
