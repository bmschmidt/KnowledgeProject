PORTADOWN, a market-town of Armagh, Ireland, is situated on the river Bann, and on the Great Northern Railway, 25 miles west-south-west of Belfast and 10 north-north-east of Armagh. The Bann, which is connected with the Newry Canal and falls into Lough Neagh about 5 miles north of the town, is navigable for vessels of 90 tons burden. It is crossed at Portadown by a stone bridge of seven arches, originally built in 1764, but since then re-erected. The town consists of a principal street, containing a number of good shops and houses, and with several streets inhabited by the working-classes branching from it at various points. The only public building of importance is the court-house and news-room. The manufacture of linen and cotton is carried on, and there is a considerable trade in pork, grain, and farm produce. The manor in the reign of Charles I. was bestowed on John Obyns, who erected a mansion and a few houses, which were the beginning of the town. A grain-market was established in 1780. The population in 1871 was 6735, and in 1881 it was 7850.
