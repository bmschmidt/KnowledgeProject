POLLOKSHAWS, a burgh of barony in Renfrewshire, Scotland, situated near the White Cart, on the Glasgow and Kilmarnock Railway, 2∣ miles south by west of Glasgow, of which it is now reckoned a suburb, connected by tramway. The streets are irregular, but contain many good houses and shops. The principal buildings are the town-hall, the mechanics’ institute, and the public library and reading-room. The staple industries are cotton-spinning, hand and power-loom weaving of silk and cotton fabrics, dyeing, bleaching, and calico-printing. There are also paper works, potteries, and large engineering works. The town was created a burgh of barony by royal charter in 1813, and is governed by a provost, a bailie, and six councillors. Population in 1871, 8921: in 1881, 9363.
