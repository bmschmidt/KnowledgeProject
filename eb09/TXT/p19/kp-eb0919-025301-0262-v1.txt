POCOCKE, Richard (1704-1765), distantly related to the preceding, was the son of Richard Pococke, head master of the free school at Southampton, where he was born in the year 1704. He received his school learning under his father, and his academical education at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he took his various degrees. He commenced his travels in the East in 1737, and returned in 1742. In 1743 he published his Observations on Egypt, under the general title of A Description of the East and some other Countries. In 1744 he was made precentor of Waterford; and in 1745 he printed the second volume of his travels, under the title of Observations on Palestine, or the Holy Land, Syria, Mesopotamia, Cyprus, and Candia. In 1756 Pococke was promoted to the bishopric of Ossory; in July 1765 he was translated to the see of Meath, and in September following he died suddenly of apoplexy, whilst engaged in visiting his diocese.
