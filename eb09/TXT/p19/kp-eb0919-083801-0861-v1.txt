PROTOZOA.
[table]

Literature. — Certain works of an older date dealing with microscopic organisms, and therefore including many Protozoa, have historical interest. Among these we may cite O. F. Müller, Animalcula Infusoria, 1786; Ehrenberg, Infusionsthierchen, 1838; [9:19:839]

Dujardin, Histoire naturelle des Infusoires, 1841; Pritchard, Infusoria, 1857.

The general questions relating to protoplasm and to the constitution of the Protozoon body as a single cell are dealt with in the following more recent treatises :—Max Schultze, lieber den Organ ismus der Polythalamien, 1854, and Ueber das Protoplasma der Rhizopodemιnd Pflanzenzellen, 1863; and Engelmann, article “Protoplasma” in Hermann’s Handwörterbuch der Physiologie, 1880.

Special works of recent date in which the whole or large groups of Protozoa are dealt with in a systematic manner with illustrations of the chief known forms are the following :—Biitschli, “Protozoa,” in Bronn’s Classen und Ordnungen des Thierreichs, a comprehensive and richly illustrated treatise now in course of publication, forming the most exhaustive account of the subject matter of the present article which has been attempted (the writer desires to express his obligation to this work, from the plates of which a large proportion of the woodcut figures here introduced have been selected); W. S. Kent, Manual of the Infusoria, 188*2— an exhaustive treatise including figures and descriptions of all species of Flagellata, Dinofiagellata, Ciliata, and Acinetaria; Stein, Der Organismus der Infusionsthiere, 1867-1882; Haeckel, Die Radiolarien, 1862; Archer, “Résumé of recent contributions to our knowledge of freshwater Rhizopoda,” Quart. Jour, of Micro scopical Science, 1876-77; Zopf, “Pilzthiere” (Mycetozoa), in Encyklopädie der Naturwissenschaften, Breslau, 1884.

We shall now proceed to consider the classes and orders of Protozoa in detail.
