PRIMATE (primas, i.e., primus'), a title more than once bestowed in the Codex Theodosianus on various civil functionaries, came about the beginning of the 4th century to be used also, especially in Africa, as a designation of the “primae sedis episcopus.” In the canon law the word “primate” is regarded as essentially the Western equivalent of the Eastern “patriarch.” See Archbishop and Patriarch.
