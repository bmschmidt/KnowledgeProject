PORTICI, a town of Italy, 5 miles south of Naples, on the shores of the bay and at the foot of Vesuvius, a little to the north of the site of Herculaneum. It is traversed by the high road and the railway from Naples (only 5 miles distant) to Salerno. The palace, erected in 1737, once contained the Herculanean antiquities, now removed to Naples, and since 1882 it has been a school of agriculture. There is a small harbour. The population (9963 in the town in 1881, and 12,709 in the commune, which includes Addolorata) is partly engaged in the fisheries, silk-growing, and silk-weaving.
