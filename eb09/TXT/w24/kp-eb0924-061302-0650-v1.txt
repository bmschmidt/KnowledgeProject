WINONA, a city and the county seat of Winona county, Minnesota, United States, is situated upon the west bank of the Mississippi, on a terrace slightly elevated above the river. This terrace is in the bottom-land, which is here 5 to 7 miles in width between the blufis, which rise 400 to 500 feet above it. The surrounding country is fertile and well settled, being devoted principally to the culture of the cereals. There are ample railroad communications, and the Mississippi is navigable for 160 miles above the city. Lumber and flour are manufactured largely. The population in 1885 was 15,664; in 1880 it was 10,208, one-third being foreign-born. The coloured element was inconsiderable.

The town was laid out in 1852, and five years later a city government was organized. In 1860 a large part of the city was destroyed by fire, but the losses were speedily repaired, and since that time the growth of Winona has been rapid.
