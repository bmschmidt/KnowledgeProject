WATERTOWN, a city of the United States, the county seat of Jefferson county, New York, is situated upon both [9:24:411] sides of Black River, 7 miles above its mouth, and is 140 miles north-west of Albany. It is laid out rather irregularly, with 60 miles of streets, is supplied with water by pumping, water-power being used, and is well sewered. The population in 1880 was 10,697, including 2444 of foreign birth. The river at this point is 60 yards wide. It falls 112 feet in two miles, and flows through the city in a succession of rapids, furnishing a magnificent waterpower to the numerous paper, woollen, and cotton mills and machine shops which line its banks.

The first settlement was made in 1800, and the town had a rapid growth from the start. The city was chartered in 1869.
