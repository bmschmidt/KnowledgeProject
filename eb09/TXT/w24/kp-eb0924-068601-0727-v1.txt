WOUWERMAN, Philip (1619-1668), a Dutch painter of battle and hunting scenes, was born at Haarlem in May 1619. He received the elements of his art instruction from his father, Paul Joosten Wouwer-man, an historical painter of moderate ability, and he then studied under Jan Wynants, and for a short time under Evert Decker. Returning to Haarlem, he became a member of its guild of painters in 1640. In that city he seems to have led the rest of his singularly productive life, and there he died in May 1668. About seven or eight hundred pictures are enumerated in Smith’s Catalogue Raisonné as the work of Philip Wouwerman, but probably many of these are the productions of his brothers Peter and Jan, and of his many other imitators. His authentic works are distinguished by great spirit and animation, and are infinitely varied and full of incident, though dealing recurrently with cavalry battle-pieces, military encampments, scenes of cavalcades, and hunting or hawking parties. He is equally excellent in his vivacious treatment of figures, in his skilful animal painting, and in his admirable and appropriate introduction of landscape backgrounds. Three different styles have been observed as characteristic of the various periods of his art. His earlier works are marked by the prevalence of a foxy-brown colouring, and by a tendency to an angular form in the draughtsmanship; the productions of his middle period have greater purity and brilliancy; and his latest and greatest pictures possess more of force and breadth, and are full of a delicate silvery-grey tone.
