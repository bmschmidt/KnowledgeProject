WALTHAM, a city in Middlesex county, Massachusetts, United States, like the other so-called cities and towns of New England is in effect a township, containing several bodies of urban population, together with rural districts. It is situated about 9 miles west-north-west from Boston, being in fact a suburb of that city, in a country of rounded hills of glacial gravel. Besides the large village of Waltham, there are comprised in the city five others, viz., Bleachery, Chemistry, New Church, Prospectville, and Robertâ€™s Crossing. These have absorbed nearly all the population of the city, the rural inhabitants being comparatively few in number. The population, by the State census of 1885, was 14,609, about one-fourth being of foreign birth. Waltham is known all over the world for its machine-made watches, of which over 1400 are turned out daily. It has also a cotton-mill, a bleachery, and watch-tool manufactories.

The present area of Waltham was settled in 1630 by Puritans. In 1783 the town was incorporated, and in 1884 it received a city charter.
