WILDBAD, a watering-place in the north-west of Würtemberg, is picturesquely situated in the romantic pineclad gorge of the Enz, 28 miles west of Stuttgart and 14 east of Baden-Baden. Its thermal alkaline springs have a temperature of 90°-100° Fahr., and are used for bathing in cases of rheumatism, gout, neuralgia, and similar ailments (see Mineral Waters, vol. xvi. p. 433). The fact that the springs rise within the baths, and are thus used at the fountain-head, is considered to contribute materially to their curative influence. The system of bathing in common is customary at Wildbad, although of course separate baths may be obtained. The water is applied internally for affections of the stomach and digestive organs, and of the kidneys, bladder, &c. Wildbad possesses all the usual arrangements for the comfort and amusement of the visiters (over 6000 annually), including large and well-appointed hotels, a curhaus, a trink-halle, and promenades. The neighbourhood is picturesque, the most attractive spot being the Wildsee, of which many legends are told. The population of the town in 1885 was 3514.
