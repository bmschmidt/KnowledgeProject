WHITWORTH, a manufacturing village of Lancashire, England, is situated on the river Spodden and on the Rochdale and Bacup branch of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, 3 miles north of Rochdale. It possesses the usual characteristics of the cotton-manufacturing districts. Coal-mining is also carried on in the neighbourhood. The church of St Bartholomew is in the Early English style. The manor of Whitworth was granted to the abbey of Stanilaw in the reign of John. A local board of twelve members was formed in 1874. The urban sanitary district, which includes the villages of Hallfold, Facit, and Leavingreave, had an area of 8000 acres, with a population of 11,892, in 1881.
