WALTON, or Walton-le-Dale, a township of Lancashire, is situated on the south bank of the Ribble, 1½miles south-east of Preston. The township includes the town of Walton-le-Dale, the villages of Bumber Bridge and Higher Walton, and several hamlets. The Ribble is crossed by a stone bridge of three arches erected in 1782, connecting Walton-le-Dale with Preston. The church of St Leonard, situated on an eminence to the east of the town, was originally erected in the 11th century. The earliest portions of the present building are the chancel and tower, in the Perpendicular style, the nave having been rebuilt in 1798, while the transepts were erected in 1816. The nave was re-pewed in 1855 and the chancel restored in 1864. There are a number of interesting old brasses and monuments. A working men’s institute was built in 1881. Cotton-spinning is carried on, and there are market-gardens in the vicinity. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 4683 acres) was 8187 in 1871 and 9286 in 1881.

Walton occupies the site of a Roman station, probably that of Coccium. The manor was granted by Henry de Lacy about 1130 to Robert Banastre. It afterwards passed by marriage to the Langtons, and about 1592 to the Hoghtons of Hoghton. Walton was the principal scene of the great battle of Preston, fought on the 17th August 1648 between Cromwell and the duke of Hamilton. In 1701 the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Derwentwater, and other Jacobites incorporated the town by the style of the “mayor and corporation of the ancient borough of Walton.” In 1715 the passage of the Ribble was bravely defended against the Jacobites by Parson Woods and his parishioners.
