WILLMORE, James Tibbitts (1800-1863), English line engraver, was born at Bristnall’s End, Handsworth, near Birmingham, on 15th September 1800. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to William Radcliffe, a Birmingham engraver, and in 1823 he went to London and was employed for three years by Charles Heath. He was afterwards engaged upon the plates of Brockedon’s Passes of the Alps and Turner’s England and Wales. He engraved after Chalon, Leitch, Stanfield, Landseer, Eastlake, Creswick, and Ansdell, and especially after Turner, from whose Alnwick Castle by Moonlight, the Old Téméraire, Mercury and Argus, Ancient Rome, and the subjects of the Rivers of France he executed many admirable plates. He was elected an associate engraver of the Royal Academy in 1843. He died on 12th March 1863.
