WARANGAL, or Worungul, an ancient town in the Nizam’s Dominions, or Hyderabad state, situated 86 miles north-east of Hyderabad city, in 17° 58' N. lat. and 79° 40' E. long., and containing in 1881 a population of 3347. It was the ancient capital of the Hindu kingdom of Telingána, founded by the Narapati Andhras, of which now little remains to denote its former grandeur except the four gateways of the temple of Siva. These are still in a state of tolerable preservation.
