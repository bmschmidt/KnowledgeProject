WALKER, Sears Cook (1805-1853), astronomer, was born at Wilmington, Massachusetts, U.S., on March 28, 1805. He kept a school at Philadelphia till 1845, when he was appointed assistant at the Washington observatory. Shortly afterwards he took charge of the astronomical department of the United States Coast Survey, where he was among the first to make use of the electric telegraph for the purpose of determining the difference of longitude between two stations, and he introduced the method of registering transit observations electrically by means of a chronograph. He also investigated the orbit of the newly discovered planet Neptune. He died at Cincinnati on January 30, 1853.
