WALTHER, Bernhard (1430-1504), astronomer, was born at Nuremberg in 1430. He was a man of large means, which he devoted to scientific pursuits. When Regiomontanus (q.v.) settled at Nuremberg in 1471, Walther built for their common use an observatory and a printing office, from which numerous calendars and ephemerides were issued, which became of great importance for the voyages of discovery. At this, the first German observatory, clocks driven by weights were first used in astronomical observations in 1484. The observations, continued until Walther’s death in May 1504, were published by Schoner in 1544, and by Snell in 1618, as an appendix to his edition of Landgrave William’s observations.
