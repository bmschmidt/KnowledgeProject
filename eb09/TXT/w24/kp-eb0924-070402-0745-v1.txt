WYANDOTTE, formerly a city and the county seat of Wyandotte county, Kansas, United States, had in 1886 a population of 13,840. In that year Armourdale (2634) and Kansas City, Kansas (4755), were consolidated with Wyandotte under the name of Kansas City, Kansas. The city is situated upon the west bank of the Missouri river and north bank of the Kansas river, in eastern Kansas, immediately adjoining the State line, and separated by it from Kansas City, Missouri. The surrounding country is a fertile and highly cultivated prairie. The city is intersected by several railroads, most of which are branches of the Missouri Pacific system. It is rather irregularly laid out, being an aggregation of independent settlements, and its municipal improvements are in a formative stage. The population in 1886 was 21,229 (about 16 per cent, of foreign birth and 20 per cent, coloured). Kansas City is the third in the State in point of population.
