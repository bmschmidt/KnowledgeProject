ESCHSCHOLTZ, Johann Friedrich, a German traveller and naturalist, born November 12, 1793, at Dorpat, where he died May 12, 1831. He was naturalist and physician to Kotzebue’s exploring expedition during 1815-18. On his return, he was appointed professor of medicine, and manager of the zoological museum of the university at Dorpat, and in 1823-26 he accompanied Kotzebue on his second voyage of discovery. Among Eschscholtz’s publications are the System der Ahalegdien, Berlin, 1829, and the Zoologischer Atlas. The genus of plants Eschscholtzia was named by Chamisso in honour of the naturalist. For a figure of the first species described, E. californica, see E, plate ii. in vol. iv. of this work.
