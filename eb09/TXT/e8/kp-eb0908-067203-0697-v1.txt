EUPOMPUS, one of the most celebrated of Greek painters, was a native of Sicyon, and a contemporary of Zeuxis and Parrhasius, who flourished in the 4th century b.c. He was the head of the Sicyonian school of art, and was held in very high esteem by his countrymen. When Lysippus the sculptor was beginning his career, he consulted Eupompus as to whom he should take for his model. “Take nature herself for your model,” replied Eupompus, “and be not shackled by the trammels of any predecessor.” No mention is made of more than a single piece by Eupompus—a victor in the games bearing a palm.
