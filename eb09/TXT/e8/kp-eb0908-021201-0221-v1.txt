ENFIELD, a market town of Middlesex, is situated ten miles N.E. of London. A large number of its inhabitants are employed in the royal small arms factory at Enfield Lock, where the rifle now manufactured, however, is not the “Enfield,” but the Martini-Henry. Enfield has the remains of an ancient royal palace, in which Edward VI. kept his court, and where Elizabeth rested on her way to London in order to assume the crown. Near to it is Enfield chase, disforested in 1799 and divided between various parishes and the Crown, and now occupied by several country seats of the more opulent traders of London. The population of Enfield in 1871 was 16,054.
