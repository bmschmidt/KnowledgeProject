EUSTATHIUS, St, bishop of Bercea, was a native of Side in Pamphylia. By the council of Nice, in which he distinguished himself by his zeal against the Arians, he was promoted in 325 to the patriarchate of Antioch. So violent was the feeling among the Arians against him, that a synod of Arian prelates, convened at Antioch in 330, brought about his deposition on a charge of Sabellianism, as well as of various instances of unfaithfulness to his vows of celibacy. He was banished to Thrace, where he died probably in 359 or 360. Of several works attributed to Eustathius there is only one which can with certainty be pronounced hisâ€”an address, namely, to the emperor Constantine, delivered during the sitting of the council of N ice.
