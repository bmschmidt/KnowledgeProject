ESTREMOZ, a town of Portugal, in the province of Alemtejo, 22 miles W. of Elvas on the road to Lisbon. It was once a strongly fortified place with accommodation for a garrison of 20,000 men, but its citadel and forts are now falling into decay. There are marble quarries in the neighbourhood, and the Estremoz l>ucaros, a kind of jar with a pleasant odour, are well known throughout Portugal. The queen of Portugal, St Elizabeth, died in the town in 1336. Population about 6600.
