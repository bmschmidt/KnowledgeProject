ERIGONE. In the Attic myth of Dionysus, Erigone is the daughter of Icarius, who, having received from Dionysus the gift of wine, shares it with some shepherds, who, drinking it undiluted, fancy themselves poisoned, and having murdered Icarius, throw his body into a well. Guided by her dog Maira (the glistening one), Eιigone— whose name, like that of Protogeneia (see Endymion), denotes one bom in early morning—discovers the crime, and hangs herself. After her death she is said to have been translated to the constellation which the Latins called Virgo.
