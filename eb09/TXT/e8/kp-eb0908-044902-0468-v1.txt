ENOS (the ancient Aenos), a seaport town in the metropolitan province of European Turkey, vilayet of Adrianople and sandjak of Gallipoli, is situated on the south side of the Gulf of Enos, 38 miles N.W. of Gallipoli and 80 miles S.W. of Adrianople. It is connected with Adrianople by the river Maritza, and for a long time has been its principal seaport; but on account of its harbour having become partially choked by a sandbank, and the fact that Adrianople is now connected by rail with the neighbouring port Dédé-Agatch, its trade is gradually declining. The deposits which have accumulated in the harbour are the cause of fevers which at certain periods almost decimate the population. Population about 7000.
