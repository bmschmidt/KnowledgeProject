ERMAN, Paul (1764-1851), a German physicist, was born in Berlin February 29, 1764. He originally intended to study for the church, but his inclination towards physical science induced him to change his purpose, and he became teacher of science at the French gymnasium in Berlin, and afterwards at the military academy. On the foundation of the university of Berlin in 1810 he became professor of physics, an office which he held until his death, 11th October 1851. In 1806 he became a member of the Academy of Physical Science. Erman made various discoveries of some importance in the departments of electricity, magnetism, optics, and physiology. His son, George Adolph, still living (1878), is a well-known physicist and geographer.
