ENNISCORTHY, a market-town of Wexford county, Ireland, 13 miles N.N.W. of Wexford, on the side of a steep hill above the Slaney, which here becomes navigable for barges of a large size. It is on the line of railway between Dublin and Wexford. It possesses tanneries, breweries, flour mills, a woollen factory, and a distillery. Enniscorthy was taken by Cromwell in 1G49, and in 1798 was stormed and burned by the rebels, whose main forces encamped on an eminence called “Vinegar Hill,” which overlooks the town from the east. The old castle of Enniscorthy, a massive square -pile with a round tower at each corner, is one of the earliest military structures of the Anglo-Norman invaders. Population in 1871, 5594.
