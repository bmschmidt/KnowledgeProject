ENGINEERING —the art of designing and constructing works—embraces a very wide range of subjects, and the different departments into which the profession is now divided do not admit of very strict definition; but it may be mentioned that civil engineering includes the design and construction of canals, river navigations, harbours, docks, roads, bridges, railways, lighthouses, water supply, irrigation, sewerage, gas supply, telegraphs, &c.; mechanical engineering iucludes machinery, mill-work, steam-engines, iron shipbuilding, agricultural implements, &c.; mining engineering includes the working and raising of coal, iron, lead, copper, &c., and other minerals; and military engineering includes fortifications, gunnery, artillery, telegraphy, &c., as applied in warfare.
