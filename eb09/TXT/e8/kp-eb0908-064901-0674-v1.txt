EUBULIDES, a native of Miletus, was a philosopher of the Megaric school. The principal events in his personal history are quite unknown. Indirect evidence shows that he was a contemporary, whether older or younger is not certain, of Aristotle, whose philosophy he attacked with great bitterness, and that he numbered Demosthenes for a while among his pupils. He is not known to have written any independent work, and his name has been preserved chiefly on account of some celebrated, though false and captious, syllogisms of which he was the reputed author. There is reason to believe that some of these were due to others of the Megaric school.
