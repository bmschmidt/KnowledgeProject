EMS, a watering place of Prussia, in the district of Wiesbaden, province of Hesse-Nassau, is situated on the Lahn, 7 miles S.E. of Coblentz, in a beautiful valley surrounded by wooded mountains and vine-clad hills.

It possesses alkaline hot springs, which are used both for drinking and for bathing, and are considered of great efficacy as a remedy for chronic nervous diseases and affections of the liver and respiratory organs. About 15,000 persons frequent them annually. In Ems, on July]3th, 1870, took place the famous interview between King William of

Prussia and the French ambassador Benedetti, which resulted in the French and German war of 1870-71. The population of Ems in 1875 was 6104.
