ENDOR, an ancient town of Palestine, originally belonging to the Philistines, and chiefly memorable as the abode of the sorceress whom Saul consulted on the eve of the battle of Gilboa, in which he perished. Although situated in the territory of the tribe of Issachar, it was assigned to Manasseh. In the time of Eusebius and Jerome it still existed as a large village 4 miles south of mount Tabor; and at the same distance, on the northern slope of the lower ridge of Hermon, there is still a village of this name.
