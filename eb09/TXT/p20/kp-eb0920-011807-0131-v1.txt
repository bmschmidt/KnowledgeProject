PUTTY is a kind of cement composed of fine powdered chalk intimately mixed with linseed oil, either boiled or raw, to the consistency of a tough dough. It is principally used by glaziers for bedding and fixing sheets of glass in windows and other frames, by joiners and painters for filling up nail-holes and other inequalities in the surface of wood-work, and by masons for bedding ashlar-work. The oxidation of the oil gradually hardens putty into a very dense adherent mass. When putty is required to dry quickly, boiled oil and sometimes litharge and other driers are used. “Putty powder” or “polisher’s putty” is oxide of tin in a state of fine division used for the polishing of glass, hard metals, granite, and similar substances.
