PYGMALION is the Greek form of a Phoenician name probably derived from the name of a god, DJfS (C. I. S., par. i. t. i. p. 133). Pygmalion or, as Josephus writes, Phygmalion, brother of Dido (Elissa), has been spoken of in Phoenicia (vol. xviii. p. 807). Another Pygmalion, son of Cilix and grandson of Agenor, king of Cyprus, is the subject of a famous story. He fell in love with an ivory statue he had made; Aphrodite granted life to the image, and Pygmalion married the miraculously born virgin (Ovid, Metam. , x. 243 sq.}.
