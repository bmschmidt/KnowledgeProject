PURIM (Cia), a feast of the later Jews, celebrated in honour of the deliverance of the nation from the schemes of Haman recorded in the book of Esther. The historical value of this record has been discussed in the article Esther, where also mention is made of the now very prevalent opinion that the feast is an adaptation of a Persian festival. The derivation of the name “Purim,” as well as the thing, from the Persian Furdigan (Pördigän, Pördiyän) has been raised above the level of a mere guess by Lagarde, who has shown that the readings φoυpp,aca and φovp8ιa in one of the Greek recensions of Esther point with great probability to a form φoυp8aιa (^' ’ "Ι*ΗS)' instead of Purim, exactly corresponding with the Persian word (Ges. Abh., p. 164; Armen. Stud., § 1339). The feast falls on the 14th and 15th of Adar, and is, in accordance with Esther ix. 22, of a joyous character, but quite secular in tone, with a great deal of hard drinking, the only quasi-religious features being the reading in the synagogue of the book of Esther and the section about Amalek, Exod. xvii. 8 sg. This celebration appears to have made its way among the Jews only gradually; according to Josephus, however, it was generally observed in his day in all parts of the Jewish world. On the other hand, the preparatory fast on the 13th of Adar, which is based on Esther ix. 31, cannot have been observed in Palestine till a later date, for in the Megillath Taanith (after the death of Trajan), Adar 13, “the day of Nicanor,” is still one of the days on which fasting is forbidden.
