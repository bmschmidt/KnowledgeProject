IPSWICH (7734), the second most important town of Queensland, Australia, is built on the south side of the river Bremer at the head of navigation, about 24 miles in a westerly direction from Brisbane, in 27° 35' S. lat. and 152° 50' E. long. It is the centre of a rich pastoral and agricultural district, the principal product being maize. Coal is worked on the banks of the Bremer and the Brisbane, and there is a woollen factory in the town. A courthouse, a hospital, a lunatic asylum, a grammar school, opened in 1863, and a school of arts are among the public buildings. The first sale of crownlands took place on October 11, 1843; and the first steamer between Brisbane [9:13:213] and Ipswich was run June 29, 1846. It was in 1860 that the town was incorporated as a municipality, and in the same year was held the first session of the supreme court. The railway to Brisbane was opened in 1875. The value of ratable property is estimated at about .£350,000. In 1871 the population of Ipswich was 4820; in 1876, including the suburbs, it was 7734.
