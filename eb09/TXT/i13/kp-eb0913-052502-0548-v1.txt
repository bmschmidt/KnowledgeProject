IVORY COAST, that part of the West African seaboard which lies between the Grain Coast (now almost all belonging to Liberia) and the Gold Coast, or between Cape Palmas on the west and the Assini river on the east. Slightly different limits are assigned by different writers, and part of the territory which belongs to the traditional Ivory Coast is now officially incorporated in the Gold Coast region, the western limit of which is placed at 5° W. long., a good way to the west of the Assini river. In the older books of travel (both English and foreign) we often find the alternative names Tooth Coast (Zadvn-Küste) or Quaqua Coast, and less frequently the coast of the five and six stripes (alluding to a kind of cotton fabric in favour with the natives). The trade in ivory has long lost its importance, and at the present day there are very few European trading stations in this part of Guinea. Fort Nemour, Grand Bassam, Piccaninny Bassam, Drewin, and Walloo are the chief points of interest.
