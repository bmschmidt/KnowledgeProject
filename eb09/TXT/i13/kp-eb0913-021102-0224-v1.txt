IPHICRATES, an Athenian general who flourished in the earlier half of the 4th century b.c., owes his fame as much to the improvements which he made in the accoutrements of the peltasts or light-armed troops as to his numerous victories gained by their aid. Increasing the length of their javelins and swords, substituting linen corselets for their heavy coats-of-mail, and introducing the use of light shoes, called after him Iphicratides, he increased greatly the rapidity with which these troops could make the sudden forays that were so common in the military tactics of the time. With his peltasts Iphicrates seriously injured the allies of the Lacedaemonians in the Corinthian war, and in 392 succeeded in dealÂ·iqg a heavy blow at once to the vanity and the prestige of the Spartans, by almost annihilating a body of their famous hoplites. Following up his success, be took city after city for the Athenians; but his arrogance procured his transfer from Corinth to the Hellespont, whither, however, his success followed him. About 378 he accepted a command under the Persians in Egypt, and on his return thence to Athens commanded an expedition in 373 for the relief of Corcyra, which was menaced by the Lacedaemonians. On the peace of 371, Iphicrates seems to have returned to Thrace, and somewhat tarnished his fame by siding with his father-in-law. King Cotys, in a war against Athens for the possession of the entire Chersonese. The Athenians, however, soon pardoned him and gave him a joint command in the social war. For his conduct in this position he was impeached; after his acquittal he lived quietly at Athens. The date of his death is unknown.
