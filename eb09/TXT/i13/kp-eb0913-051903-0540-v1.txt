IVAN IÎ ., surnamed the Great, grand-duke from 1462 to 1505, forms one of the most important figures in the annals of Russia, for to him is due the consolidation of the autocracy. His long reign of forty-three years was very beneficial to his country. He was a skilful diplomatist, and often brought about by intrigue what others could only effect by force of arms. Thus he reduced to submission the haughty republic of Novgorod, and united to the principality of Moscow those of Tver, Rostoff, and Yaroslavl; he also took Kazan in 1487, but it was not definitively incorporated with Moscow till the reign of Ivan IV. He reconquered the territory as far as the river Sozh, which had fallen under the dominion of the Lithuanians. In 1472 he married Sophia, niece of Constantine Palaeologus. In consequence of this union Ivan considered himself the heir of the Byzantine emperors, and adopted the two-headed eagle for his arms. Embassies were sent to foreign powers. Italian architects were invited into Russia, and many learned Greek monks found refuge there from the yoke of the Turks.
