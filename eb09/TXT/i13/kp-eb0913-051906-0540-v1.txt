IVAN VI., czar in 1740-41, was son of Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick by his marriage with Anne, granddaughter of Ivan V. The reign of this unfortunate young man lasted but a year, under the regencies of his mother and Biren. Owing to the success of the revolution under Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the Greιt, he was confined as a prisoner in Schlüsselburg, and Anthony and Anne with their other' children were banished to Kholmogori in the government of Archangel. By long detention in the fortress Ivan became, it is said, half-witted. In the year 1764 a certain Lieutenant Mirovich attempted to deliver him from captivity and proclaim him emperor. Ivan, however, was slain in the skirmish that ensued, and Mirovich was afterwards publicly executed. According to some, he had been urged to the act by Catherine, who wanted an excuse for putting Ivan to death.
