ISTIB or Ishtib, a town of European Turkey, in the eyalet of Nish (Macedonia), a few miles south-east of Uskub, situated at a height of 590 feet on a small stream of its own name, which joins the Bregalnitza, a tributary of the Vardar. It is estimated to contain from 15,000 to 20,000 houses, and possesses several fine mosques, a number of fountains, and a large bazaar. A small syenitic knoll to the north-west is crowned by the ruins of an old castle. Istib is the ancient Astibas.
