INNOCENT XII., Antonio Pignatelli, pope from 1691 to 1700, was the successor of Alexander VIII. He came of a distinguished Neapolitan family, and was born March 13, 1615. Educated at the Jesuit college in Rome, he in his twentieth year became an official of the court of Urban VIII.; under successive popes he served as nuncio at Florence and Vienna and in Poland; and by Innocent XI. he was made cardinal (1681) and archbishop of Naples. Immediately after his election (July 12, 1691) he declared against the nepotism which had too much and too long been one of the greatest scandals of the papacy; the bull “Romanum decet Pontificem,” issued in 1692, prohibited popes in all times coming from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative; at the same time he sought [9:13:86] to check thé simoniacal practices of the apostolic chamber, and in connexion with this to introduce a simpler and more economical manner of life into his court. He introduced various much-needed reforms into the States of the Church, and for the better administration of justice erected the Forum Innocentianum. In 1693 he compelled the French bishops to retract the four propositions relating to the “Gallican Liberties” which had been formulated by the assembly of 1682. In 1699 he decided in favour of Bossuet in his controversy with Fénelon about the Explication des Maximes des Saints sur la Vie Intérieure of the latter. His pontificate contrasted with that of a series of predecessors in having marked leanings towards France instead of Germany. This benevolent, self-abnegating, and pious pope died on September 27, 1700, and was succeeded by Clement XI.
