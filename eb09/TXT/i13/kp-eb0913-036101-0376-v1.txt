IRONTON, the chief city of Lawrence county, Ohio, is situated on the river Ohio, 142 miles south-east of Cincinnati. Occupying a central position in a productive mineral district, its chief industry, as its name suggests, is connected with iron. There are iron-furnaces, rolling and planing mills, and machine shops in the town; and stoves, boilers, nails, and other iron goods are manufactured to a considerable and yearly increasing value. Ironton was founded in June 1849 by the Ohio Iron and Coal Company, and received its city charter sixteen years later. The population in 1880 was 9000.
