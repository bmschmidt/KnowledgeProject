ISTHMIAN GAMES, oue of the four great Panhellenic festivals, were held on the Isthmus of Corinth. An ancient ceremony of the worship of Melicertes or Melkarth, introduced by the Phoenician traders who frequented the isthmus from the earliest time, was afterwards modified by the Old Ionic worship of Poseidon; and at the festival the heroes Neleus and Sisyphus received honour along with the two deities. About 582 b.c., the festival was arranged after the analogy of the Olympian and Pythian games, but was celebrated every two years. The festival was managed by the Corinthians; and after the city was destroyed by Mummius (146 B.c.) the presidency passed to the Sicyonians until Julius Caesar restored Corinth. The Athenians were closely connected with the festival, and had the privilege of proedria, the foremost seat at the games, while the Eleans were absolutely excluded from participation. The games included gymnastic, equestrian, and musical contests; and the prize was a crown made at one time of parsley, at a later period of pine.
