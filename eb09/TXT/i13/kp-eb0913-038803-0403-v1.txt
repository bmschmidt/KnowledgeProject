ISMID, IsκiMID, or IsNIKMID (ι.e., ’Eiç Νικομήδειαν), a town of the Turkish vilayet of Khudavendikiar in Asia Minor, in the sandjak of Scutari, situated at the head of the bay of Ism id (the ancient Sinus Astacenus), an inlet of the Sea of Marmora. It is connected by rail with Scutari, and the line is being continued eastward to Ada Bazar. As the seat not only of a pasha but also of a Greek metropolitan and an Armenian archbishop, Ismid retains somewhat of its ancient dignity, but the material condition of the town is little in keeping with its rank; and but few traces are left of the magnificence which it possessed as Nicomedia, the capital of Bithynia. The population, estimated at from 10,000 to 15,000, are engaged in silk weaving and in commerce, Ismid being a great outlet of goods from the interior. See Nicomedia.
