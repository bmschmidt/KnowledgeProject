LUCENA, a town øf Spain, in the province of Cordova, 37 miles south-south-east from that city, and 11 miles by road south-east from the Aguilar station of the Cordova-Malaga Railway. It is pleasantly situated on the Cascajar, a minor tributary of the Genii, in a district that produces oil, wine, and cereals in great abundance, and affords excellent pasture. The parish church, which is large but not otherwise remarkable, dates from the beginning of the 16th century. The chief industries are the manufacture of hardware and pottery, bronze lamps being a specialty of Lucena, and also the large earthenware jars {tinajas) used throughout Spain for the storage of oil and wine. There is considerable trade in the produce of the neighbourhood, and the horse mart is famous throughout Andalusia. The population in 1877 was 19,540. Lucena was taken from the Moors early in the 14th century; it was in the attempt to recapture it that King Abu ‘Abdallah (Boabdil) of Granada was taken prisoner in 1483.
