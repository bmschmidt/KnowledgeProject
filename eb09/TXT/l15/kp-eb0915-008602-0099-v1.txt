LUTZK, a district town of Russia, in the government of Volhynia, on the Styr, 162 miles west-north-west of Szitomir, and 5 miles from the Kivertzy station of the railway between Kieff and Brest-Litovsky. It is a very old town, supposed to have been founded in the 7th century; in the 11th century it was known under the name of Luchesk, and was the chief town of an independent principality. In the 15th century it was the seat of a bishop, and became a wealthy town, but during the wars between Russia and Poland in the second half of the 16th century, and especially after the extermination of its 40,000 inhabitants, it lost its importance. In 1791 it was taken by Russia. It is now a rather poor town, situated in an unfertile district, and its 11,500 inhabitants, many of them Jews, live mainly by shipping goods on the Styr.
