LOWICZ, a town of Russian Poland, on the Bzura river, in the government of Warsaw, 54 miles by rail west from the capital, on the line between Skiernewice and Bromberg. It has lately become a centre of manufacture and trade, and the population (6650 in 1872) is rapidly increasing. Its fairs are important as regards the trade in horses and cattle. In the immediate neighbourhood are situated the hamlet Liczcowice, which has a beetroot sugar factory, and the rich estates Nieboron and Villa Arcadia of the Radziwill family.
