MASULIPATAM, the chief town of Kιstna district, Madras, India, and a seaport, is situated in 16° 9' N. lat., 81° 11' E. long., with a population in 1871 of 36,316. The export trade is partly to Europe; imports are chiefly local. In 1874-75 235 vessels of 106,000 tons burthen visited the port; the exports (oil-seeds and cotton) amounted to £171,400, the imports to £119,600. The town contains the usual district offices, a jail, and several schools, the chief being the high school. It is a flourishing station of the Church Missionary Society.

Masulipatam was the earliest British settlement on the Coromandel coast. An agency was established there in 1611, and a fortified factory in 1622. During the wars of the Carnatic, the English were temporarily expelled the town, which was held by the French for some years. In 1759 the town and fort were carried by storm by Colonel Forde, and it has been held by the British ever since. Weavers form a large portion of the inhabitants of the town, though their trade has greatly declined since the beginning of this century. Their operations, besides weaving, include printing, bleaching, washing, and dressing. In former days the chintzes of Masulipatam had a great reputation abroad for the freshness and permanency of their dyes, the colours becoming brighter after washing than before. There is still a small demand for these articles in Burmah, the Straits, and the Persian Gulf; but steam machinery has nearly beaten the hand-loom out of the field. Another speciality was nιetapollarns or kerchiefs for the head; but this industry was ruined by the refusal of the West Indian negroes to wear these kerchiefs after their emancipation. Tartans, ginghams, towels, and table linen are still manufactured to some extent. The importance of the place is now declining, and the garrison was withdrawn in 1865. The heaviest blow to the prosperity of the town was given by the great storm-wave of 1864, which swept over the entire town, and is said to have destroyed 30,000. lives.
