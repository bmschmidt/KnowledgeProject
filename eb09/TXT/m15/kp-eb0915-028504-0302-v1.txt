MAHANOY CITY, a post borough of the United States, in Mahanoy township, Schuylkill county, Pennsylvania, lies at a height of 1211 feet above the sea, 56 miles fiorth-east of Harrisburg, with a station both on the Lehigh Valley and on the Philadelphia and Reading Railway. It was founded in 1859, and owes its existence to the great anthracite mines in the neighbourhood. Two public halls, a public library, two weekly newspapers, and the increase of its population from 5533 in 1870 to 7181 in 1880, betoken its prosperity.
