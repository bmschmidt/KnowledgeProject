MANGOSTEEN, Garcinia Mangostana, I.., is a tree belonging to the gamboge order (Clusiaceae or Guttiferae). It is a native of the Molucca Islands, but has been introduced into the other islands of the eastern archipelago, Ceylon, and southern Asia, and even the Antilles, though not without difficulty. It grows about 20 feet high, and is somewhat fir-like in general form, but the leaves are large, oval, entire, coriaceous, and glistening. Its fruit, the much-valued mangosteen, is about the size and shape of an orange, and is somewhat similarly partitioned, but is of a reddish-brown to chestnut colour. Its thick rind yields a very astringent juice, rich in tannin, and containing a gamboge-like resin. The soft and juicy pulp is snow-white or rose-coloured, and of exceedingly delicious and subtle flavour and perfume. Being perfectly wholesome, it may be eaten freely, and administered in fever. G. purpurea is known in India as mate mangosteen, and Embryopteris glutinifera, an ebenaceous tree, as wild mangosteen. See Druryâ€™s Useful Plants of India.
