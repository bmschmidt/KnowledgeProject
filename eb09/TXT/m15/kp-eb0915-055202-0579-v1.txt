MARKIRCH (in French, St e-Marie-aux-Mines}, a flourishing industrial town of Germany, in Upper Alsace, circle of Rappoltsweiler, is prettily situated in the valley of the Leber or Liepvrette, an affluent of the Rhine, near the French frontier. The once productive silver, copper, and lead mines of the neighbourhood are now no longer worked; and the present chief industries of the place are weaving and dyeing. In and about Markirch there are nearly forty wool and cotton factories, besides numerous looms in the cottages of the weavers; and these produce cloth to the annual value of <Â£625,000. It is estimated that there are about 40,000 workpeople in the industrial district of which Markirch is the centre. The small river Leber, which intersects the town, was at one time the boundary between the German and French languages, and traces of this separation still exist. The German-speaking inhabitants on the right bank were Protestants, and subject to the counts of Rappoltstein, while the French inhabitants were Roman Catholics, and under the rule of the dukes of Lorraine. The population in 1880 was 11,824.
