MARCHE, a former province of central France, was bounded on the N. by Berri, on the N. E. by Bourbonnais, on the E. by Auvergne, on the S. by Limousin, and on the W. by Angoumois aud Poitou, embracing the greater part of the modern department of Creuse, a considerable portion of Haute-Vienne, and fragments of Charente and Indre. It derived its name from the circumstance of its being the “mark” or boundary between Poitou and Berri; it is sometimes referred to as Marche Limousine. It is first mentioned in history as a separate fief about the middle of the 10th century, when the countship of Marche was committed by Duke William III. of Aquitania to Boso I., count of Limoges and Charroux.
