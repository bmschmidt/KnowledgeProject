MARINUS I. (Martinus II.) succeeded John VIII. in the pontificate about the end of December 882. On three separate occasions he had been employed by the three popes who preceded him as legate to Constantinople, his mission in each case having reference to the controversy excited by Photius. Among his first acts as pope were the restitution of Formosus, cardinal bishop of Porto, and the anathematizing of Photius. He died in May or June 884, his successor being Adrian III.
