MAROONS. A nègre marron is defined by Littré as a fugitive slave who betakes himself to the woods; a similar definition of cimarron (apparently from cima, a mountain top) is given in the Dictionary of the Spanish Academy. The old. English form of the word is symaron (see Hawkins’s Voyage, sec. 68). The designation in modern English is applied almost as a proper name to the descendants of those negroes in Jamaica who at the first English occupation in the 17th century fled to the mountains. See vol. xiii. p. 550.
