MANACOR, a town in the island of Majorca, stands on a slight eminence in a fertile plain, 30 miles east of Palma (40 miles by rail, by way of Inca). It is substantially built, with wide streets and several squares; it has the usual buildings (a parish church, a hospital, schools, and the like), and the former palace of the independent kings of Majorca is pointed out. The neighbourhood produces cereals, fruits, an inferior quality of wine, and some oil; and there is some trade in these, as well as in sheep and cattle. The population in 1877 was 14,894.
