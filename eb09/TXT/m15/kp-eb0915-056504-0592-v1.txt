MARQUIS, or Marquess, a title and rank of nobility, the second in the order of the British peerage, and therefore next to duke. The first marquis in England was Robert de Vere, the ninth earl of Oxford, who by Richard II., 1st December 1385, was created marquis of Dublin. On the 13th of October following the patent of this marquisate was recalled, Robert de Vere then having been raised to a dukedom. John de Beaufort, the second legitimate son of John of Gaunt, was created to the second marquisate as marquis of Dorset, 29th September 1397. From that period this dignity appears to have been dormant till the reign of Henry VI., when it was revived, and thenceforward it maintained its place in the British peerage. A marquis is “most honourable,” and is styled “my lord marquis.”

His wife, who also is “most honourable,” is a marchioness, and is styled “my lady marchioness.” The coronet is a circlet of gold on which rest four leaves and as many large pearls, all of them of equal height and connected. The cap and lining, if worn, are the same as in the other coronets. The coronet, which in representations displays one central leaf with two pearls and two half-leaves, when without cap or lining, is shown in the annexed woodcut. The mantle of parliament is scarlet, and has three and a half doublings of ermine.
