MARQUETTE, a city and port of entry of the United States, and the county seat of Marquette county, Michigan, lies on a bluff about 25 feet above a bay of Lake Superior, and is a terminus of the Marquette, Houghton, and Ontonagon, and the Detroit, Mackinac, and Marquette Railroads. Though the population of the city was only 4690 in 1880, Marquette is a place of importance as the chief shipping port for the great iron-ore region of western Michigan (787,150 tons shipped in 1881), and contains a number of blast furnaces, foundries, machine-shops, and powder-mills, while at the same time it has a reputation as a resort for invalids and tourists. A Roman Catholic cathedral, convent, and orphan asylum are among the public buildings.
