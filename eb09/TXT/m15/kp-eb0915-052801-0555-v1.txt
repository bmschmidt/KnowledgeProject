MARATHON was a plain on the north-east coast of Attica, containing four villagesâ€”Marathon, Probalinthos, Tricorythos, and Oinoe, which formed a tetrapolis. It was divided from the plain of Athens by Mount Pentelicus and the hilly district of Diacria, and was in the early period an autonomous state. After it became incorporated in the Attic state, it retained something of its original distinctive character. The worship of Apollo had its first home in Attica here, and it was carried hence to Athens when the tetrapolis was made part of the Athenian commonwealth. The district was one of the chief seats of the worship of Hercules, and boasted that it was the first place where he had been worshipped as a god. Hence legend localized here several events in the story of the Heraclidae, and especially the self-sacrifice of Macaria, daughter of Hercules. The legend of Theseus was also known in the district; here the hero slew the Marathonian bull. The plain derived its fame chiefly from the battle in which the Athenians and Plataeans under Miltiades defeated the Persians, 490 b.c. The one hundred and ninety-two Athenians that were slain were buried on the field of battle, contrary to the usual Attic custom, and a mound, which is still called Soro, was erected over them. Another tumulus covered the bodies of the slain Plataeans and slaves, and a special monument was raised to Miltiades.
