MARTINSBURG, a town of the United States, the capital of Berkeley county, West Virginia, lies on a plateau above the Tuscarora Creek, in the Shenandoah valley, 80 miles west of Washington. A station on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and a terminus of the Cumberland Valley Railway, Martinsburg is the seat of extensive machineshops belonging to the former company, which were sacked by the Confederates in 1861. The population, 4863 in 1870, was 6335 in 1880.
