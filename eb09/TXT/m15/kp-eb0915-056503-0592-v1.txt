MARQUETTE, Jacques, a Jesuit missionary and explorer, was born in 1637 at Laon in France, and died May 18, 1675, on the banks of a small stream, now known as the Marquette, which has its mouth on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. Having joined the Society of Jesus, he sailed for Canada in 1666, spent eighteen months in the vicinity of Three Rivers, founded the mission of Sault Sainte Marie on Lake Superior in 1668, and followed the Hurons to Mackinaw in 1671. It is mainly, however, as Joliet’s companion in his voyage down the Mississippi in 1673 that Marquette holds a permanent position in the history of discovery in America.

His narrative, first published in Thevenot’s Recueil de Voyages (Paris, 1681), is printed along with other documents relating to him in Shea’s Discovery and Exploration of the Mississippi Valley (New York, 1852).
