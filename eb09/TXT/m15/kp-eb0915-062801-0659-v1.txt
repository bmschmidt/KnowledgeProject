MATERA, a city of Italy in the north-east of the province of Potenza, 48 miles from Potenza, on the high road to Bari. Part of it is built on a level plateau and part in deep valleys adjoining, the tops of the campaniles of the lower portions being on a level with the streets of the upper. The principal building is the co-cathedral of the archbishopric of Acerenza and Matera, formed in 1203 by the union of the two bishoprics, dating respectively from 300 and 398. In 1871 the population of the commune was 14,312 (that of the city 14,262), in 1881 15,700.

Under the Normans Matera, the ancient Mateola, was a countship for William Bras de Fer and his successors. It was the chief town of the Basilicata from 1664 till 1811, when the French transferred the administration to Potenza.
