MARCELLUS II., Marcellus Cervini, cardinal of Santa Croce, a native of the Mark of Ancona, was elected pope iu the room of Julius III. on April 9, 1555, but his feeble constitution succumbed to the fatigues of the conclave, the exhausting ceremonies connected with his accession, and the anxieties arising from his high office, on the twenty-first day after his election. He had a high reputation for integrity, tact, and ability. His successor was Paul IV.
