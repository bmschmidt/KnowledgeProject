MARGARET (1283-1290), known in Scottish history as the “Maid of Norway,” was, through her mother Margaret, who had been married to Eric of Norway, the only grandchild of Alexander III. of Scotland, and was born in Norway in 1283. At the death of her grandfather (1286), while she was still an infant, Edward I. of England arranged for her betrothal to his son, but this policy was defeated by her early death, which took place, it was alleged, in Orkney, as she was on her way to Scotland, in 1290. The circumstances of her death were so obscure that doubts were entertained in some quarters whether she had not rather been spirited away. About 1300 a woman presented herself in Leipsic as the long-lost queen of Scotland; ultimately, however, she was burnt at Bergen as an impostor.
