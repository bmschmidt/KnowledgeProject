MAY, the fifth month of our modern year, was the third of the old Roman calendar. The name is of doubtful origin. Ovid (Fasti, v. 483-90) suggests the three derivations of [9:15:648] majestas, majores (the patres of the old Roman city), and Maia, the mother of Mercury, to whom the Romans were accustomed to sacrifice on the first day of the month. It was considered unlucky among the Romans to contract marriages during this month, on account of the celebration of the Lemuria,—a superstition of which traces are still to be found among ourselves. In the Roman Catholic Church May is known as “the month of Mary.”

May-day is the name given to the first day of the month in England, when, according to ancient custom, all ranks of the people rose at early dawn and went out ii a-Maying” to welcome the advent of spring. The customs of the day chiefly took their rise with the Romans. In the southern counties of England they differ materially from those of the northern and western. That of gathering branches of trees and flowers, to deck the person, is still observed in many places.

The May-Pole was once general throughout the country. The assemblage of the people, sanctioned by the presence of the priests, marching on May morning in procession to some neighbouring wood, returned in triumph with the pole, round which were suspended flowers, boughs, and other tokens of the spring season. On one of these festive occasions, Henry VIIΓ. assembled his court at Shooter’s Hill; and Queen Elizabeth also used to keep “May Games” at Greenwich. The May-pole, once fixed, often remained until nearly the end of the year; and there were some specially made of durable wood, which remained for many years, and were from time to time resorted to at other seasons of festivity. The last May-pole erected in London, 100 feet in height, was on the spot where the church in the Strand now stands, near Somerset House. Being taken down in 1717-18 it was conveyed to Wanstead Park in Essex, where it was fixed as part of the support of a large telescope set up by Sir Isaac Newton. The May Lady, Maulkin, Jack in the Green, and Morris Dancing are merely variations in the mode of representing the goddess Flora. The chimney sweepers, who are now the principal performers, are probably more interested than any other class in May sports. For, as the commencement of summer deprives them in a considerable degree of their business occupation, they naturally seek to avail themselves of the customary liberality of festive meetings.

The other principal fixed days observed and noted in th·e month are May 9, Half-Quarter-Day, and May 15, Whitsunday term,—not to be confounded with Whit Sunday, which is a movable feast.
