MEDELLIN, a town of Colombia, South America, capital of the state of Antioquia, is situated at a height of 4845 feet above the sea, in the valley of the Rio Pυrce, a right-hand tributary of the Rio Cauca, and, though 100 miles from the confluence, not-more than 1G miles east from the valley of the larger stream. It is a clean and well-built place, but has no public buildings of note. Though the population is estimated at 14,000, there is no great activity except on the market days, twice a week, when the buyers and sellers flock in from the country. See Fr. von Schenck in Peteτmann , s Mittheil., 1880.
