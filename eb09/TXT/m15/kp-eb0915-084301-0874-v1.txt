MELVILLE, Henry Dundas, Viscount (1741-1811), younger son of the Right Honourable Robert Dundas, lord president of the Scottish court of session, was born at Edinburgh in 1741, and was educated at the high school and university there. Becoming member of the faculty of advocates in 1763, he soon acquired a leading position at the bar. After his appointment as lord advocate in 1775, he gradually relinquished his legal practice to devote his attention more exclusively to public business. On entering parliament in 1774, he had joined the party of Lord North, and, notwithstanding his provincial dialect and ungraceful manner, he soon distinguished himself in the debates by his clear and argumentative speeches. After holding subordinate offices under the marquis of Lansdowne and Pitt, he in 1791 entered the cabinet as home secretary. From 1794 to 1801 he was secretary at war under Pitt, who conceived for him a special friendship. In 1802 he was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Melville and Baron Dunira. Under Pitt in 1804 he again entered office as first lord of the admiralty, when he introduced numerous improvements in the details of the department. His impeachment in 1806, for the appropriation of balances of public money remaining in his hands, resulted in his acquittal, but he never again held office. He died May 27, 1811.
