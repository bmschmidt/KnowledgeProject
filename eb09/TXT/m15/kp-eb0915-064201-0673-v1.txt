MAURUS, St, according to the Roman Breviary (January 15), was a Roman of noble birth, and while still a child was placed by his father Eutychius under the discipline of St Benedict, where he soon became a model of all the virtues and endowed with the gift of miracles. Sent by his master into Gaul, he founded a monastery over which he presided for forty years. When he died in 565 he was over seventy. The monastery referred to is that of Glanfeuil or St Maur-sur-Loire. In point of fact it may be said that everything relating to the introduction of the Benedictine order into France, unless the name of him who introduced it be made an exception, is purely legendary. The famous “Congregation of St Maur” dates from the 17th century, having received papal sanction in 1621 and 1627; it arose out of an earlier “congregation” of reformed Benedictines, which took its name from St Vannes near Verdun, and was sanctioned by Clement VIII.
