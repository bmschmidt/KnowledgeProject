MALMÖ, a seaport town of Sweden, inferior only to Stockholm and Gothenburg in importance, is the capital of the län or province of Malmöhus, and stands on the eastern shore of the Sound, opposite Copenhagen, from which it is 16 miles distant. The town, which is built on a level plain, formerly had strong fortifications, of which all that now remains is the citadel, where the earl of Bothwell was imprisoned for some time after 1573; it is at present used as a house of correction. In the large central square (Stortorg), which is planted with trees, stands the townhall, a brick and sandstone structure in the Renaissance style; it contains the handsome Knutssal, or former council chamber of the guild of Canute. The principal ecclesiastical buildings are the church of St Peter (Petrikyrka), begun in 1319, and the German church (Tyskakyrka). The harbour in the north-west has recently been deepened, and admits vessels drawing 18 feet of water; there is daily communication by steamer with Copenhagen, and also at regular intervals with Stockholm, Gothenburg, Lübeck, &c. The trade of the port is considerable, the exports including timber, iron, tar, oil-cake, and bones, while the imports consist chiefly of wine, saltfish, salt, and coal. There are a number of manufactures, that of gloves being the specialty. Malmö is connected with Stockholm by rail. Population in 1878, 35,626.

Malmö (Malmhauge, Malmey, Malmöye, Malmoughe), sometimes called “Ancona Scanorum” or “Ellenbogen,” first appears in history about the middle of the 13th century. During the Hanseatic period it was the most important commercial town on the Sound, but in the 16th and 17th centuries greatly lost ground owing to the decay of its herring fisheries and the rise of its rival Copenhagen. Its modern prosperity is largely due to the enterprise of Frans Suell, one of its merchants, who first constructed the harbour, which has more than once been enlarged subsequently.
