MALTZAN, Heinrich K. E. H. Freiherr [Baron] von (1826-1874), African and Oriental traveller, was born in the vicinity of Dresden, and studied law at Jena, but on account of ill-health spent much of his time from 1850 in travel. Succeeding to his father’s property in 1852, he extended the range of his journeys to Morocco and other parts of the Maghrib, and before his return home in 1854 had also visited Egypt, Palestine, and other countries of the Levant. In 1856-57 he was again in Algeria; in 1858 he reached the city of Morocco; and in 1860 he succeeded in performing the pilgrimage to Mecca, which he afterwards described in his book Meine Wallfahrt nach Mecca, but had to flee for his life to Jeddah without visiting Medina. He then visited Aden and Bombay, and after some two years of study in Europe again began to wander through the coasts and islands of the Mediterranean, repeatedly visiting Algeria. His first book of travel, Three Years in the NorthWest of Africa, appeared in 1863, and was followed by a variety of works and essays, popular and scientific, till a little before his death at Pisa in 1874, when he put an end with his own hand to neuralgic pains which had tortured him for years.

Maltzan’s last book, Reise in Arabien (1873), is one of his most useful contributions. It contains, like his other works, some lively description, but is chiefly valuable as a digest of much information about little-known parts of South Arabia collected from natives during a residence at Aden in 1870-71. Among his other services to science must be noticed his collection of Punic inscriptions (Reise in Tunis und Tripolis, 3 vols., Leipsic, 1870), various collections on Arabic dialects (Z. D. Μ. G., various dates), and the editing of Von Wrede’s remarkable journey in Hadramaut (1873).
