MARANHÃO, or Maranham (Latinized as Marag-nanum), in full form Sao Luiz de Maranhão, the chief town of the province of Maranhao in Brazil, is situated in 2° 30' S. lat. and 44° 17' W. long., on the west side of an island of the same name 28 miles long and 15 broad. Though built on so hilly a surface that carriages cannot be used, it is laid out with regularity, and has straight, wide, and clean-looking streets. The public institutions comprise a naval arsenal, a high court of appeal, a tribunal of commerce, a military hospital, several general hospitals, a theatre, a museum, a public library, and a botanic garden, as well as a cathedral and an episcopal palace, both built by the Jesuits. Maranhao has some commercial importance, exporting cotton, sugar, hides, &c., from a wide region of the interior, and receiving manufactured goods from Europe, and especially from England. Though somewhat difficult of access to large sailing vessels, the port affords good anchorage to all drawing less than 20 feet. Steamers ply to Rio de Janeiro and Para, as well as up the rivers Itapicuru, Guajahu, and Pindare; and direct steam communication is maintained with Lisbon and Liverpool. The population of the island Maranhao was 34,023 in 1872, about 30,000 belonging to the city.

French colonists settled at St Luiz in 1612, but they were expelled by Jeronimo d’ Albuquerque in 1614. The Dutch were in possession from 1641 to 1653. The bishopric was created in 1676. The city was captured in 1823 by Lord Cochrane, who was afterwards created marquis of Maranham.
