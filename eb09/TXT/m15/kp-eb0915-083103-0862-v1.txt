MEIBOM, Heinrich (1555-1625), was born at Lemgo on December 4,1555, and died on September 20, 1625, at Helmstadt, where he had held the chair of history and poetry from 1583. He was a writer of Latin verses {Parodiarum Horatianarum Libri III. et Sylvarum Libri II., 1588), and his talents in this direction were recognized by the emperor Rudolph II., who ennobled him and made him poet laureate in 1590 , but his claim to be remembered rests entirely on his services in elucidating the mediaeval history of Germany. His Opuscula Historica ad res Germanicas spectantia were edited and published in 1660 by his grandson, Heinrich Meibom (1638-1700), who also was professor of history and poetry at Helmstadt, and incorporated the grandfatherâ€™s work with his own Herum Germanicarum Scriptores (1688).
