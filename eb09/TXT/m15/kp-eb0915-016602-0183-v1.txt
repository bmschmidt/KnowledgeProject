MACON, a city of the United States, the chief town of Bibb county, Georgia, is situated on rising ground in the midst of a beautifully wooded country on both sides of the Ocτnulgee river, a navigable headwater of the Altamaha, about 80 miles south-east of Atlanta. It is well laid out with tree-bordered streets, often 180 feet wide, and possesses since 1870 a fine central park, on the formation of which $125,000 were expended. The principal institutions in the town are the State academy for the blind (1852), the Mercer university (a Baptist foundation, 1838), the Wesleyan Female College (1839), the Pio Nono (Roman Catholic) College, and the Southern Botanico-Medical Institute. As an important junction for the Georgia, the Georgia Central, and the South-Western Railways, and communicating with the coast by the direct line to Brunswick«, Macon enjoys great facilities for trade; and, besides its extensive railway machine-shops, it has cotton factories, iron foundries, flour-mills, and sash and blind factories. The annual fair held in the Central Park is the great meetingplace of the Georgian planters. From 5720 in 1850 the population has steadily advanced to 8247 in 1860, 10,810 in 1870, and 12,748 in 1880. The foundation of the town dates only from 1823.
