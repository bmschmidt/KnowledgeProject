MARCELLUS, Μ. Claudius, was curule aedile in 56 b.c. with P. Clodius. In 52 he spoke on behalf of Milo at his trial. In 51 he was consul with Ser. Sulpicius. During his consulship he proposed to remove Caesar from his army from March 49. The decision was, however, delayed by Pompeius’s irresolution till February 50, and then the tribune C. Curio insisted that Pompeius also should vacate his command; and the senate voted this by a large majority. But at last C. Marcellus, cousin of Marcus, and then consul, went to Pompeius with the two consuls elect, and offered h ; m the command of the army against Caesar. In January 49 Μ. Marcellus tried to put off declaring war till an army could be got ready; but when Pompeius left Italy Marcus and his brother Caius followed, while his cousin withdrew [9:15:533] tα Liternum. After Pharsalus Μ. Marcellus retired to Mytilene. He long made no attempt to return, till in 46 the senate appealed to Caesar. Marcellus accepted this favour reluctantly. Pressed by Cicero, he left Mytilene for Italy, but was murdered in May by Magius Cilo in the Piraeus. Marcellus was a thorough aristocrat, but free from the violence which disgraced many of his party.
