MARGHILAN, Baber’s Marghinan, 40 o 28' N. lat., 71° 45' E. long., now the administrative centre of the Russian province of Ferghana (⅛.v.), a very old town, with high earthen walls and twelve gates, commanded by the fort of Yar Mazar, lies in a beautiful and extraordinarily fertile district of the same name, irrigated by canals from the Shahimardân river. The heat in summer is excessive. Population about 40,000, chiefly Usbeg. The principal industry is the production and manufacture of silk; camels’ hair and woollen fabrics are also made. The new Russian town, planned by General Skobeleff, is 15 versts distant.
