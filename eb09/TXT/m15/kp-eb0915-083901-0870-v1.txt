MELCHIADES, or Miltiades (other forms of the name being Meltiades, Melciades, Milciades, and Miltides), was pope from July 2, 310, to January 10 or 11, 314. He appears to have been an African by birth, but of his personal history nothing is known. The toleration edicts of Galerius and of Constantine and Licinius were published during his pontificate, which was also marked by the holding of the Lateran synod in Rome (313), at which Caecilianus was acquitted of the charges brought against him, and Donatus condemned. Melchiades was preceded and followed by Eusebius and Sylvester I. respectively.
