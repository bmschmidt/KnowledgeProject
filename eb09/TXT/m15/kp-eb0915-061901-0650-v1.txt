MASSORAH (∏jS9), better Massoreth (∏⅛8), a late Hebrew word meaning “tradition,” is the technical term specially applιpd to the tradition by which Jewish scholars (Massorets, Γ∏DEΠ '⅛5) sought to fix the correct writing and reading of the text of the Old Testament. An oral tradition on disputed points of this sort naturally existed from the early days of the Jewish schools, but the use of a written Massorah in notes on the margin of Bibles, at the end of Biblical codices or of the individual books contained in them, or in separate works appears to have followed the introduction of the vowel points, and to have been influenced by similar labours of Syrian scholars. See Hebrew Language, vol. xi p. 600
