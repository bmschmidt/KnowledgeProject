MALLANWÁN, a town in Hardoi district, Oudh, India, situated on the Hardoi and Unas road, in 27° 2' 10" N. lat. and 80° 11' 30" E. long., with a population in 1869 of 11,670. Under native rule the town possessed considerable political importance, and upon the British annexation of Oudh it was selected as the civil headquarters of the district, but was abandoned in favour of Hardoi town on the reoccupation of the province after the mutiny. The town has now but little trade, and a deserted indigo factory occupies the site of the old fort. Saltpetre and brass utensils are manufactured.
