MARGARET of Austria (1522-1586), duchess of Parma, and regent of the Netherlands from 1559 to 1567, was a natural daughter of Charles V. by Margaret van Gheenst, a Flemish lady, and was born at Brussels in 1522. In 1533 she was married to Alexander, duke of Florence; and, having been left a widow in 1537, she became the wife of Ottavio Farnese, duke of Parma, in 1542. The union proved an unhappy one, and she for the first time found a sphere for her somewhat masculine abilities in the Netherlands, which were entrusted to her care by her brother Philip II. of Spain on his departure for the peninsula in 1559 (see Holland, vol. xii. pp. 74, 75). It was with much reluctance that she resigned the reins of power into the hands of the duke of Alva in 1567 and retired to Italy. Before her death, which occurred at Ortona in 1586, she had the satisfaction of seeing her son Alexander Farnese appointed to the government which she had occupied some twenty years before.
