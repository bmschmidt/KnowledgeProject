MARYBOROUGH, a town of Queensland, Australia, in the county of March, on the left bank of the Mary river, 25 miles from its mouth, about 180 miles north of Brisbane, in 25° 35' S. lat and 152° 43' E. long. It is the principal shipping port for an extensive district, communicating by steamer and coach with Brisbane and (since 1881) by railway with the Gympie gold-fields, 54 miles to the south. A large shipbuilding yard, saw-mills, distilleries, breweries, and soap-works are among the industrial establishments of the town, and extensive sugar factories exist in the neighbourhood. Besides a handsome courthouse and town-hall, the public buildings comprise a hospital, a school of arts with a considerable library, and immigration barracks. Gas-lighting and water from the Tinana creek were both introduced in 1879. The population of the census district in 1876 was 8608, that of the municipal area about 7000. Maryborough had only about 600 inhabitants in 1860; the municipality dates from 1861, and was reincorporated in 1875.
