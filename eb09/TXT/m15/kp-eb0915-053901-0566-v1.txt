MARIA THERESA (1717-1780), archduchess of Austria, queen of Hungary and Bohemia, and empress of Germany, was the daughter of the emperor Charles VI. of Austria, by his wife Elizabeth Christina of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, and was born in Vienna on May 13, 1717. By the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, a settlement which was guaranteed by the principal states of Europe, her father had regulated the succession in the imperial family; and in 1724 accordingly, after the death of the archduke Leopold, her only brother, she was publicly declared sole heiress of the Austrian dominions. In 1736 she married Francis Stephen of Lorraine, who in the following year became grand-duke of Tuscany; and on October 20, 1740, she came to the throne, her husband (emperor in 1745) being declared co-regent. The events of her reign have been briefly summarized under Austria (vol. iii. p. 127- 129) and Hungary (xii. 370). She died at Vienna on November 29, 1780. Of sixteen children whom she bore to Francis, ten reached maturity. Her sons were Joseph II., who succeeded his father as Holy Roman emperor in 1765; Leopold, grand-duke of Tuscany, afterwards the emperor Leopold II.; Ferdinand, duke of Modena; and Maximilian, elector of Cologne. Of her daughters the best-known is Marie Antoinette, the wife of Louis XVI. of France.
