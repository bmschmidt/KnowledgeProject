MARÁGHA, a town of Persia, province Azerbijan, 37° 20' N., 46° 25' E., 68 miles from Tabriz, 232 north-west of Tehran, pleasantly situated in a long narrow valley opening towards Lake Urmiah, which lies 10 miles to the north-west. The town consists mostly of mud houses enclosed by a high dilapidated wall, and containing no conspicuous buildings except a large bazaar and fine public bath. Nâsir-ed-din’s observatory formerly stood on a hill to the west, where there are some old tombs covered with Cufic inscriptions. The surrounding gardens and plantations[9:15:526] are watered by canals from a small river crossed here by two good bridges built in 1809. At the village of Dash-Kesen, 6 miles from Deh Kurgân in this district, are the famous Marâgba marble pits, occupying a space half a mile in circumference, and sunk to a depth of about 12 feet. Here a multitude of springs charged with carbonic acid gas bubble up in all directions, precipitating large quantities of carbonate of lime. The marble in the semicrystallized formation, of this deposit forms horizontal layers, which when cut in thin slabs are nearly transparent, and serve as windows in the Tabriz baths and elsewhere. Larger blocks are also used as pavements in bazaars and palaces, and the famous throne in the Diwân Khâna at Tehrân is made of the same material. Marâgha was formerly the capital of Hûlakü, grandson of Jenghis Khân, and its fifteen thousand inhabitants still belong mostly to the Mukadam Turki tribe.
