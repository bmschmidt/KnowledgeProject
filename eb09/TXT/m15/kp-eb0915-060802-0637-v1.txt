MASCARENE ISLANDS, or Mascarenhas, a group in the Indian Ocean to the east of Madagascar, consisting of Mauritius (île de France), Réunion (Bourbon), and Rodriguez. Mauritius and Rodriguez belong to Great Britain, Réunion to France. The collective title is derived from the Portuguese navigator Garcia Mascarenhas, by whom Bourbon, at first called Mascarenhas, was discovered in 1505.
