MARULLUS, Michael Tabchaniota (ob. 1500), one of the most brilliant scholars of the golden age of Florentine learning, was born at Constantinople, and at an early age, on the fall of his native city, was brought to Ancona in Italy, where he became the friend and pupil of Pontanus, with whom his name is associated by Ariosto (Orl. Fur., xxxvii. 8). He was a soldier and a poet, and in the latter capacity published épigrams and hymni naturales. ^[1. Two books of epigrams appeared first without date; an enlarged edition, with two additional books, published in 1497, contains also •the so-called hymns.] Marullus took no part in the work of translation, then so favourite an exercise of scholars, but he was understood to be planning some great work when he perished, 10th April 1500, in the river Cecina near Volterra. Of other incidents in his life his feud with Politian and his marriage to the beautiful and learned Alexandra Scala, whom he .praises in his poems, may be noticed. The name of Marullus is now perhaps most familiar from the brilliant emendations on Lucretius which he left unpublished, and which were used for the Juntine edition. See especially Munro’s Lucretius, 2d ed., p. 6 sq.
