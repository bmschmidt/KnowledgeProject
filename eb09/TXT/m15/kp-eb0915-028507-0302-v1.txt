MAHÉ, a French settlement and town, in the Malabar district, Madras, India, is situated in 11° 4Γ 50" N. lat. and 75° 34' 25" E. long., to the south of the river Mahé, with an area of 1445 acres. It is the only French possession on the west coast of India, and is in charge of a chef-de-service, subordinate to the governor-general at Pondicherri. It is now a decaying place, with most of its chief buildings [9:15:286] picturesquely situated close to the river mouth. The population in 1871 was 8492. It contains a Român Catholic chapel, a school, and a British post-office; and a long wooden bridge maintained by the British Government gives access to the British territory beyond the river.
