MATLOCK, a town of Derbyshire, England, is situated on the river Derwent and on the Midland Railway, 149 miles north-west of London and 17 north-west of Derby. It possesses cotton, corn, and paper mills, and in the vicinity there are lead-mines. About 1∣ miles south-east, also on the Derwent, is Matlock Bath, possessing hot medicinal springs. There are in all three springs, the first of which was discovered in 1692. Their mean temperature is 68° Fahr., and applied both externally and internally the water is efficacious in glandular affections, rheumatism, biliary obstructions, and relaxation of the muscular fibres. The fine scenery of the vale of Matlock, and its proximity to the thickly peopled districts of Lancashire and Yorkshire, cause the village to be much frequented in summer not only by invalids but by holiday visitors. There are several large stalactite caverns. Matlock Bank, a mile to the north-east, in a finely sheltered situation, contains several well-known hydropathic establishments. The population of the urban sanitary district of Matlock (4513 acres) in 1871 was 3834, and in 1881 it was 4396; that of Matlock Bath and Scarthin Nick in the same years was 1386 and 1698. These two districts are conterminous with the civil parish of Matlock.
