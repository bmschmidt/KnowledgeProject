MANCHESTER, a town of the United States, in Hartford county, Connecticut, with a station on the New York and New England Railroad, 8 miles east of Hartford. Its spinning and weaving mills turn out annually 2,000,000 yards of gingham and 90,000 pairs of stockings; and its paper mills (upwards of a dozen in number) produce not only vast quantities of book paper but Government and bank-note paper for several nations. At South Manchester, 2âˆ£ miles distant, and reached by a branch line, are the silk factories of Messrs Cheney, which cover about 8 acres, and give employment to one thousand operatives. The factory village has been laid out by a landscape gardener; and connected with it are a public hall, a library and readingroom, and a free school. The population of the town has increased from 4223 in 1870 to 6462 in 1880.
