MAROS-VÁSÁRHELY, a royal free town of Hungary, and capital of the Transylvanian county of Maros-Torda, is situated on the Maros and on the Hungarian Eastern Railway, 50 miles north-east of Hermannstadt, in 46° 30' N. lat., 24° 3Γ E. long. It is the seat of the “royal table” court of appeal for the Transylvanian circle, of royal and circuit courts of law, of a board of works, and of offices of assay and of the Government tobacco monopoly; as also the headquarters both of the militia and regular infantry for the district. The town is well built, partly upon rising ground, and has a citadel with barracks, three churches (one large and handsome), and a college belonging to the Calvinists; Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, religious houses, and schools; a public library of 80,000 volumes, with a picture gallery and fine collection of minerals; a theatre, a hospital, and several philanthropic and industrial institutes. The trade is chiefly in timber, planks, materials for house-roofing, grain, wiηe, tobacco, and other products of the neighbourhood. Both weekly and special markets are held. At the end of 1880 the population amounted to 12,843 (6265 males, 6578 females), Magyars and Roumanians by nationality.
