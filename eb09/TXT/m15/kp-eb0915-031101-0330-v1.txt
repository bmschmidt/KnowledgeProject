MAKALLÁ, or Maculla, a port on the south coast of Arabia, in 14° 3Γ N. lat. and 49° 13' E. long. The town, which appears to be of no great antiquity, is described by Wellsted as built on a low projecting point, with many lofty and substantial houses, and a suburb of huts, chiefly inhabited by slaves, Somalis, and Arab sailors, on the slopes leading up to a lofty chalk-hill (Jebel el-Kâra) which overhangs the town. The Arab inhabitants are of the Beni Tsâ tribe. The Somali traders do not settle permanently in Makallâ, but they form an important element in the population. There are also Indian residents (Banians). The harbour is good, and the town, which may be regarded as the port of Hadramaut, rose during the decline of Aden to the rank of the chief emporium between India and the Somali coast. It still exports, among other productions of Hadramaut, tobacco, mother-of-pearl, and incense to Jeddah and shark fins to India, but has lately declined in the general transformation of the character of the Eastern trade. According to the latest Arabic accounts (see Badger in the Academy, March 4, 1882), the town contains about a thousand houses. Makallâ is governed by a prince or nakib who is esteemed one of the chief minor potentates of that coast. The present prince Salah el-Kesâdi has made himself quite independent of the surrounding Bedouins, and is even reported to have made conquests in the interior.
