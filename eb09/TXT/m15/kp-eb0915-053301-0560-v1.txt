MARCELLUS, Îœ. Claudius, son of C. Marcellus and Octavia, sister to Octavianus, was born about 43 b.c. Octavianus adopted him and made him pontifex and senator with praetorian rank. In 25 he married Julia, daughter of Octavianus, and was looked on as his future successor. Yet in a dangerous illness Augustus gave his signet to Agrippa. Differences arising, Agrippa was made proconsul of Syria to separate the rivals. In 23 Marcellus, while curule aedile, fell ill and died at Baiae. Livia was suspected of having poisoned him to get the empire for her sou Tiberius. Great hopes had been built on the youth, and he was celebrated by many writers, especially by Virgil, in a famous passage in Aen. vi.
