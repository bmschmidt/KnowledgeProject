MARYPORT, a market and seaport town of Cumberland, England, is situated on the Irish Sea, 29 miles southwest from Carlisle. It is irregularly built, partly on a cliff and partly on the sea-shore. The streets are spacious, but there are no public buildings of importance. The town until 1750 consisted of a few huts called Ellenfoot, when a harbour was constructed by Humphrey Senhouse, which gave a great impulse to its prosperity. The principal exports are coal to Ireland and pig-iron to the Continent, the principal imports timber and general merchandise. Shipbuilding is carried on to a small extent. In 1881 the number of vessels *that entered from foreign and colonial ports was 72, of 35,241 tons burden; the number that cleared 120, of 60,840 tons burden. The coasting trade is much more important, the number of vessels that entered being 1805, of 215,332 tons burden, and the number that cleared 1753, of 187,290 tons. There are rope and sailcloth works, iron foundries, and saw-mills, also brewing and tanning. The population of the urban sanitary district in 1871 was 7443, and in 1881 it was 8177. There was a Roman camp in the neighbourhood of Maryport, and the district is rich in Roman antiquities.
