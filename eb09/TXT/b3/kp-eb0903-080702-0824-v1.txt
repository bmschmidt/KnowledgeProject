BLANE, Sir Gilbert, a distinguished physician, was born at Blanefield in Ayrshire, in 1749, and died in London in 1834. He was educated at Edinburgh University, and shortly after his removal to London became private physician to Lord Rodney, whom he accompanied to the We3t Indie3. Through his skill and exertions the health of the seamen on board the fleet remained comparatively unaffected by the climate; aad on his return home he embodied the results of his experience in a treatise On the Diseases of Seamen, 1783. He rose rapidly to fame, acquired an extensive practice, and in 1812 was appointed physician in ordinary to the Prince of Wales, with the rank of baronet. When at the head of the Navy Board of Health, an office he held for some years, he introduced many useful measures for securing the health of seamen during long voyages. Of his numerous works the most important is the Elements of Medical Logic, 1819.
