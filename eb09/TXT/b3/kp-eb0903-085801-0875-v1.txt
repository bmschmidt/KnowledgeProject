BOGHAZ-KEUY, or Boghas-Koei (i.e., the Village of the Gorge), a small hamlet in Asia Minor, remarkable for its ruins, which are identified with the ancient Pterium or Pteria. It stands 3515 feet above the sea-level, about half-way between Angora and Amassia, almost in the 40th parallel of N. lat., on the banks of a small tributary of the Kizil Irmak. The present village contains about 150 houses, but the remains give evidence of its former importance. Almost all the heights they occupy bear traces of fortification; extensive chambers have been excavated in the rocks; many portions of escarpment are elaborately sculptured; and the massive foundations of a vast temple or palace can still be traced. The date and origin of these ruins have given rise to much discussion. Dr Barth thinks the city was probably founded by Cyaxares, the Mede, and explains the groups of sculpture as commemorating the peace between Cyaxares and Alyattes, which is described by Herodotus in the 74th chapter of his 1st book. M. Texierâ€™s hypothesis, on the other hand, is that the carvings represent the introduction of the worship of Astarte into Phrygia; and this interpretation has been provisionally accepted by Van Lennep, in whose Travels in Asia Minor, 1870, carefully-drawn copies of the sculptures will be found. (See also Barth, Reise von Trapezunt nach Scutari, 1860, and in Monatsbericht der B erb Akad. der Wissensch., Febr., 1859.)
