BAYAZID, or Bajazid, a city of Turkish Armenia, in the pashalic of Erzeroum, 50 miles S.S.W. of Erivan, situated on the side of a rugged mountain that forms, as it were, a bastion of the Ala-dagh chain. It contains two churches, three mosques, and a monastery, that of Kara Killeesea, which is famous for the beauty of its architecture, as well as for its antiquity and grandeur. The summit of the mountain is occupied by the ruinous Ak Serai, or palace, which was built by Mahmoud Pasha. The Pasha’s tomb, a work of considerable richness, is in the neighbouring mosque. The position of the town, on the frontiers of Turkey and Persia and on the high road between Armenia and A^zerbi-jan, gives it a certain importance. It was captured by the Russians in 1828 and again in 1854, when they destroyed the fortifications on their departure. The population, which has decreased greatly within the last forty years, now numbers about 5000. Long. 43° 26' E., lat. 39° 24' N.
