BAKER, Henry, a distinguished naturalist, was bom in Fleet Street, London, in 1698. At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to a bookseller, with whom he remained for seven years. He then became clerk to Mr Forster, attorney, whose deaf and dumb daughter he instructed carefully, and with such success that for a time he devoted himself to the training of persons similarly afflicted. During this period of his life he published several poems, and married Sophia, youngest daughter of the famous Daniel Defoe, who bore him two sons, both of whom he survived. In 1740 he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and of the Royal Society. He contributed many memoirs to the Transactions of the latter society, and in 1744 received the Copley gold medal for microscopical experiments on the crystallisation and configuration of saline particles. Mr Baker died at his apartments in the Strand on the 25th of November 1774. Besides his numerous memoirs in the Philosophical Transactions, he published two valuable treatises on the microscope: The Microscope made Easy, London, 1743, and Employment for the Microscope, 1753. Another well-known work is his philosophical poem, The Universe, which has passed through several editions. Mr Baker’s memory is perpetuated by the Bakerian Lecture of the Royal Society, for the foundation of which he left by will the sum of £100.
