He was himself a scholar of considerable repute, had studied at Brussels and Ferrara, and before settling in Paris, had taught Greek for several years at Lyons. He illustrated with notes several of the classics which he printed, and was the author of numerous pieces, amongst which are a life of Thomas Ã  Kempis, and a satire on the follies of women, entitled Navicula Stultarum Mulierum. He diedin 1535. His epitaph was written by his grandson, the celebrated Henry Stephanus.
