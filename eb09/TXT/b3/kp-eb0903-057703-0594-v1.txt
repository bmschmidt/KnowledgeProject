BENTIVOGLIO, Guido, Cardinal, an eminent statesman and historian, was born at Ferrara in 1579. After studying at Padua, he went to reside at Rome, and was received with great favour by Pope Clement VIII., who made him a prelate. He was sent as nuncio into Flanders, and afterwards to France; and when he returned to Rome he was intrusted by Louis XIII. with the management of the French affairs at that court. In 1621 he was made a cardinal, and in 1641 received the bishopric of Terracina. He was the intimate friend of Pope Urban VIII., and on the death of Urban public opinion marked out Bentivoglio [9:3:578] for his successor. He died suddenly, however, before the election took place. His principal works are, Bella Guerra di Fiandria, 1632-39; Relazioni di G. Bentivoglio in tempo delle sue Nunziature di Fiandria e di Francia, 1631; Memorie, 1648; Lettere, 1631.
