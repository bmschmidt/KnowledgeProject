BASSI, Laura Maria Caterina, an Italian lady, eminently distinguished for her learning, was born at Bologna in 1711. On account of her extraordinary attainments she received a doctorâ€™s degree, and was appointed professor in the philosophical college, where she delivered public lectures on experimental philosophy till the time of her death. She was elected member of many literary societies, and carried on an extensive correspondence with the most eminent European men of letters. She was well acquainted with classical literature, as well as with that of France and Italy. In 1738 she married Giuseppe Verrati, a physician, and left several children. She died in 1778.
