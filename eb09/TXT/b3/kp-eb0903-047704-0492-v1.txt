BECERRA, Gaspar, a distinguished Spanish painter and sculptor, was born at Balza in 1520. He studied at Rome, it is said under Michel Angelo, and assisted Vasari in painting the hall of the Concelleria. He also contributed to the celebrated anatomical plates of Valverde. After his return to Spain he was extensively employed by Philip II., and decorated many of the rooms in the palace at Madrid with frescoes. He also painted altar pieces for several of the churches, most of which have been destroyed. His fame as a sculptor almost surpassed that as a painter. His best work was a magnificent figure of the Virgin, which was destroyed during the French war. Becerra died in 1570. The most competent judges assign to him the chief share A in the establishment of the fine arts in Spain.
