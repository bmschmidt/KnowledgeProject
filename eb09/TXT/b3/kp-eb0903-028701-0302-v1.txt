BALLATER, a village of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, on the River Dee, 42 miles W. from Aberdeen. In its vicinity are the medicinal wells of Pannanich, Balmoral Castle (a summer residence of Queen Victoria), and Ballatrich Farm, where Byron spent part of his boyhood. Ballatrich is a short distance from “Lachin-y-Gair ’ ' (Lochnagar), one of the loftiest of the Grampian range, and the subject of one of Byron’s most beautiful poems.
