BAR-SUR-AUBE, the chief town of an arrondissement in the department of Aube, in France. It is a station on the Paris-and-Mulhouse line, and is situated on the right bank of the River Aube, at the foot of Sainte-Germaine, in a picturesque district, the wine of which is much esteemed. It is a pretty little town, with a few remains of its ancient [9:3:357] fortifications. There are several churches of considerable antiquity—the most remarkable being Saint Maclou. In 1814 Bar-sur-Aube was the scene of several conflicts between Oudinot and the Allied Army, in which the latter ultimately gained the victory. Population in 1872, 4453. Long. 4° 44' E., lat. 48° 1 3' N.
