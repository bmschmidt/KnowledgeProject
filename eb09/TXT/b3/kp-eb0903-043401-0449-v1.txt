BATH, a city and port of the United States of North America, chief town of the county of Sagadahock in Maine. It is situated on the W. bank of the Kennebec, about twelve miles from the sea, and forms a station on the branch railway from Brunswick to Rockland. The prosperity of the town depends almost entirely on its shipping and fisheries; and its manufacturing industries are nearly all auxiliary to the one department of shipbuilding, in which it competes with the chief American centres of the trade. It has a fine custom-house built of granite. The city was settled in 1756, incorporated in 1780, and raised to the rank of a city in 1850. Population (1870), 7371.
