BACCHYLIDES, Βακχυλίδι??, a famous Greek lyric poet, born at Iulis in Ceos, was the nephew of Simonides, and flourished about 470 years before Christ. He resided long at the court of Hiero of Syracuse with Simonides and Pindar, of whom he is said to have been the rival. His works consisted of odes, dithyrambs, and hymns. Two epigrams contained in the Greek Anthology ascribe to him peculiar softness and sweetness of style. The few remains of his writings are contained in the collections of Brunck, Bergk, Bland, and Hartung They have been published separately by Neue, Bacchylidis Cei Frag., Berl., 1823.
