BALL, John, a Puritan divine, of whom Baxter speaks in very high terms, was born, in 1585, at Cassington, or Chessington, near Woodstock, and died in 1640. He entered Brazenose College, Oxford, in 1602, and remained there five years. He then migrated to St Mary’s Hall, from which he took his bachelor’s degree in 1608. Soon after graduating he went into Cheshire to act as tutor to [9:3:283] the children of Lady Cholmondeley. While there he was thrown into the company of some enthusiastic Puritans, whose views he quickly adopted. He resolved upon entering the church, and, going up to London, obtained ordination from an Irish bishop. He was afterwards appointed to the small curacy of Whitmore, hear Stoke, in Staffordshire, and here he passed the remainder of his life, eking out his miserable stipend by teaching a small school. The most popular of his numerous works was the Short Treatise, containing all the Principal Grounds of Christian Religion, which haβ passed through a great many editions, and has been in common use as a Puritan catechism. His Treatise of Faith, and Friendly Trial of the Grounds tending to Separation, the latter of which defines his position with regard to the church, are also valuable works.
