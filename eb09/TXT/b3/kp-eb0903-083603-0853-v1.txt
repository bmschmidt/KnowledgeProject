BLOOD, Thomas, generally known by the appellation of Colonel Blood, was a disbanded officer of the Parliamentary army. Bearing a grudge against the duke of Ormond, who had defeated a conspiracy he engaged in to surprise the castle of Dublin, Blood seized the duke one night in his coach in St James’s Street, and carried him off a considerable distance, resolving to hang him at Tyburn; but Ormond struggled for his liberty and was rescued by his servants. Soon after, in 1671, Blood formed the design of carrying off the crown and regalia from the Tower,—an attempt which very nearly proved successful. He had bound and wounded Edwards, the keeper of the jewel-office, and had escaped out of the Tower with his prey; but he was overtaken and seized, together with some of his associates. One of these was known to have been concerned in the attempt upon Ormond, and Blood was immediately concluded to be the ringleader. When questioned, he frankly avowed the enterprise, but refused to discover his accomplices. All these extraordinary circumstances induced Charles II. to seek an interview with him, which not only led to his pardon, but to the king’s granting him an estate of £500 a year in Ireland, encouraging his attendance about his person, and showing him great favour. He died August 24,

1680.
