BEECHEY, Sir William, R.A., a fashionable portraitpainter, born at Burford in December 1753, was originally bred as a conveyancer, but a strong love for painting induced him to become a pupil at the Royal Academy in 1772. Some of his smaller portraits gained him considerable reputation; he began to be employed by the nobility, and in 1793 became associate of the Academy. In the same year he was made portrait-painter to Queen Charlotte, an appointment which increased his celebrity. He painted the portraits of the members of the royal family, and of nearly all the most famous or fashionable persons of the time. What is considered his finest production is a review of cavalry, a large composition, in the foreground of which he introduced portraits of George III., the Prince of Wales, and the duke of York, surrounded by a brilliant staff on horseback. It was painted in 1798, and obtained for thi artist the honour of knighthood, and the rank of R.A. The earlier portraits of Beechey were carefully drawn and well finished; but in his later days the extent of his employment rendered him less careful in his design. His works are generally vigorous, but are wanting in grace and dignity. He was a good, but not an eminent portrait painter. He died in January 1839, at the advanced age of eighty-six.
