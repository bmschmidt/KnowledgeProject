BALLYCASTLE, a seaport town of Ireland, county Antrim, situated on a bay opposite Rathlin island. The town is well built, consisting of two parts, about a quarter of a mile asunder, and connected by a fine avenue. Towards the close of the 18th century, one of the Boyd family devoted himself to the extension and improvement of the town, establishing manufactures, endowing charities, and building churches, and succeeded in producing a temporary vitality. Upwards of Â£150,000 is said to have been expended upon the pier and harbour; but the violence of the sea overthrew the former, and the latter has been filled with sand. To the east of the town are the remains of an abbey. Population in 1871,1253.
