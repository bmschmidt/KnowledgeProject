BLARNEY, a small village of Ireland, in the county of Cork, about 5 miles from that city, chiefly celebrated as giving name to a peculiar kind of eloquence, alleged to be characteristic of the natives of Ireland. The “Blarney Stone,” the kissing of which is said to confer this faculty, is pointed out within the castle.
