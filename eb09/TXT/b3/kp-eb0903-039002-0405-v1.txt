BARRA, or Barray (from the Scandinavian Baraey i isle of the ocean), one of the Hebrides or Western Isles of Scotland, forming part of Inverness-shire. It lies about 5 miles S.W. of South Uist, and is 8 miles in length by from 2 to 4 miles in breadth. The parish comprehends a number of smaller islands and islets,—Berneray, Flodday, Fluda, Hellisay,Mingalay, Watersay, &c.,—and is estimated to contain 4000 acres of arable land, and 18,000 of meadow and hill pasture. The cod, ling, and herring fisheries are considerable; and the coasts abound with shell-fish, especially cockles, which have sometimes afforded food to the inhabitants in times of famine. On Barra Head, the highest point of Berneray, is a lighthouse with an intermitting light 680 feet above high water, in lat. 56° 48' N., long. 7° 38' W. There are several remains of interest in the island of Barra, as the churches at Kilbar, the castle of the M "Neils at Kishmul, “Danish” forts and “Druidical” circles. Population of island (chiefly Gaelic-speaking Roman Catholics) in 1871, 1563; of the parish, 1753.
