BIRON, Armand de Gontault, a baron and marshal of France, and a celebrated general, who signalized himself by his valour and conduct in several sieges and battles in the 16 th century. He was made grand master of the artillery in 1569, and commanded at the siege of Rochelle, and in Guienne. He was one of the first who declared for Henry IV.; he brought a part of Normandy under his subjection, and dissuaded him from retiring to England or Rochelle. Biron was killed by a cannon-ball at the siege of Epernay, July 26, 1592. He was a man of considerable literary attainments, and used to carry a pocket-book, in which he noted everything that appeared remarkable. This gave rise to a proverb at court, when a person happened to say anything uncommon, “You have found that in Biron’s pocket-book.”
