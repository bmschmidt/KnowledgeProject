BATHGATE, a town of Scotland, in the county of Linlithgow, 19 miles from Edinburgh, and 26 from Glasgow, with both which it has direct communication by railway. The town is irregularly built, and has no buildings of importance except a well-endowed academy. The district is rich in limestone, coal, shale, and ironstone, which afford employment to a large part of the population. Paraffin and chemicals are extensively manufactured, and there are glass-works and flour-mills. Population (1871), 4491.
