BARDILI, Christoph Gottfried, a German metaphysician, distinguished by his opposition to the system of Kant, was born at Blaubeuren in Wiirtemberg, in 17G1, and died at Stuttgart in 1808. Of his numerous works the principal is his Elements of Logic {Grundriss der ersten Logik, Stuttgart, 1800). His system has had but little influence in Germany, the celebrated Reinhold being the only adherent of any importance. Yet in some respects his ideas opened the way for the later speculations of Schelling and Hegel. He dissented strongly from the Kantian distinction between matter and form of thought, and urged that philosophy should consider only thought in itself, pure thought, which is the ground or possibility of being. The fundamental principle of thought and criterion of certitude was, according to him, the law of identity; logical thinking was real thinking. The matter upon which thought operated was in itself indefinite and unformed, a mere aÏ€ecpov, which was rendered definite or took determinate forms through the action upon it of thought. Bardili, however, worked out his fundamental idea in an abstract, one-sided manner. Thought, as conceived by him, had no power of development in it, and ultimately reduced itself to a species of arithmetical computation. (See on his system the notices in Michelet, Geschichte der letzten Systeme, Bd. i., and Erdmann, Versuch einer Geschichte d. neu. Phil., Bd. iii. pt. i.)
