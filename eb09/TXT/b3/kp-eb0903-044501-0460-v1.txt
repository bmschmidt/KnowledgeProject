BATTLE, a market-town in the county of Sussex, on the South-Eastern Railway, 56 miles from London. It is situated in a valley, and consists of one street. Its name is derived from the conflict in 1066, which insured to William the Norman the crown of England. The abbey founded by him forms a most magnificent pile of ruins, and the ancient gatehouse is still in good preservation. The place is now celebrated for its gunpowder manufactories. Population of the parish in 1871, 3495.
