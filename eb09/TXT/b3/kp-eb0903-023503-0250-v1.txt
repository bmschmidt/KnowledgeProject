BAGNACAVALLO, Bartolommeo, an Italian painter, who flourished about the beginning of the 16th century. His real name was Ramenghi, but he received the cognomen Bagnacavallo from the little village where he was born in 1484. He studied first under Francia, and then proceeded to Rome, where he became a pupil of Raffaelle. While studying under him he worked along with many others at the decoration of the gallery in the Vatican, though it is not known what portions are his work. On his return to Bologna he quickly took the leading place as an artist, and to him were due the great improvements in the general style of what has been called the Bolognese school· His works were considered to be inferior in point of design to some other productions of the school of Raffaelle, but they were distinguished by rich colouring and graceful delineation. They were highly esteemed by Guido and the Carracci, who studied them carefully and in some points imitated them. The best specimens of Bagnacavallo’s works, the Dispute of St Augustin and a Madonna with Child, are at Bologna. He died in 1542.
