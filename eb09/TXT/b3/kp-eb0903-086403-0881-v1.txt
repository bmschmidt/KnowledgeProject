BOISSARD, Jean Jacques, a classical antiquary and Latin poet, was born at Besançon in 1528. He studied at Louvain; but, disgusted by the severity of his master, he secretly left that seminary, and after traversing a great part of Germany reached Italy, where he remained several years, and was often reduced to great straits. His residence in Italy developed in his mind a taste for antiquities, and he soon formed a collection of the most curious monuments of Rome and its vicinity. He then visited the islands of the Archipelago, with the intention of travelling through Greece, but a severe illness obliged him to return to Rome. Here he resumed his favourite pursuits with great ardour, and having completed his collection, returned to his native country; but not being permitted to profess publicly the Protestant religion, which he had embraced some time before, he withdrew to Metz, where he died, October 30, 160δ. His works are—

1. Pοemata, Eρigramrnatum libri tres, Elegiae libri tres, Epistolarum libri tres, Basel, 1574; 2. Emblemata, Metz, 1584; 3. Icones Virorum Illustriim, 1597, sqq. ; 4.
