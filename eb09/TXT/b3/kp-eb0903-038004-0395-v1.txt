BAROCCHIO, or Barozzi, Giacomo da Vignola, architect, born at Vignola in the Modenese territory, in 1507. He succeeded Michel Angelo as the architect of St Peterâ€™s, and executed various portions of that fabric, besides a variety of works in Rome and other parts of Italy. The designs for the Escorial were also supplied by him. He is the author of an excellent work on the Hive Orders of Architecture. His character as a man was worthy of his genius; for to his extensive acquirements and exquisite taste were superadded an amenity of manners and disposition and a noble generosity, that won the affection and admiration of all who knew him. He died in 1573, at the age of sixty-six.
