BANNOCKBURN, a village of Scotland, on the Bannock, an affluent of the Forth, three miles S. of Stirling. In 1871 its population amounted to 2564, principally employed in the manufacture of tweeds and carpets. In the neighbourhood, on the 24th of June 1314, was fought the memorable battle which secured the independence of Scotland, and established Bruce upon the throne. A fragment of the “bore stone” in which the royal standard w r as placed, is still to be seen, protected by an iron framework. At Sauchieburn, in the neighbourhood, James III. was defeated by his subjects in 1488. See Scotland.
