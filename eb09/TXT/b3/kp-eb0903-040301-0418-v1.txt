BARTHOLINUS, Gaspard, a learned Swede, born in 1585, at MalmoÃ«. His precocity was extraordinary; at three years of age he was able to read, and in his thirteenth year he composed Greek and Latin orations, and delivered them in public. When he was about eighteen he went to the University of Copenhagen, and he afterwards studied at Rostock and Wittemberg. He then travelled through Germany, the Netherlands, England, France, and Italy, and was received with marked respect at the different universities he visited. In 1613 he was chosen professor of medicine in the University of Copenhagen, and filled that office for eleven years, when, falling into a dangerous illness, he made a vow, that if it should please God to restore him, he would apply himself solely to the study of divinity. He recovered, observed his vow, and soon after obtained the professorship of divinity, with the canonry of Rotschild. He died on the 13th of July 1630, after having written nearly fifty works on different subjects.
