BELT, Great, and Little Belt, two straits which connect the Baltic Sea with the Cattegat. The former, with a depth of from 5 to 20 fathoms, and a breadth of about 15 miles, runs, from S.S.E. to N.N.W., between the islands of Zealand and Fünen; while the Little Belt, which is only about half as wide, with a narrow entrance from the Cattegat, separates Fünen from the mainland of Schleswig. The navigation of both is rather dangerous for large vessels, owing to the number of sandbanks and small islands; and on that account the Sound, which lies to the east, is the channel preferred by shipping.
