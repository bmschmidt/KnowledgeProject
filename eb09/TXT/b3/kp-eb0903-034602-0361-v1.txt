BANN, a considerable river of Ireland, which rises in the Mourne Mountains, County Down, and falls into Lough Neagh. From this it emerges as the Lower Bann, and, flowing between the counties of Antrim and Londonderry, falls into the Atlantic, four miles S.W. of Portrush. The Upper Bann is navigable for vessels of 50 tons to its junction with the Newry canal, a little above Portadown. The Lower Bann flows in a northerly direction; it is navigable up to Coleraine for vessels of 200 tons, but the bar at its mouth renders it difficult of access in rough weather, and its course is broken by a fall of 13 feet about a mile above Coleraine. The salmon and Ã©el fisheries are of considerable value. Measured in a direct line, the Upper Bann is about 35 miles long, and the Lower 30 miles.
