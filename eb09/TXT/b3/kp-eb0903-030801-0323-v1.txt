BANBRIDGE, a town of Ireland, county of Down, on the Bann, 23 miles S.W. of Belfast, standing on the summit of an eminence. To facilitate access, a central carriageway, 200 yards long, has been cut through the main street to a depth of 15 feet, the opposite terraces being connected by a bridge. Banbridge is a neat town, with a handsome church, several chapels, a market-house (built in 1831), and a court-house. It is the principal seat of the linen trade in the county, and has extensive cloth and thread factories, bleachfields, and chemical works. Population in 1871, 5600.
