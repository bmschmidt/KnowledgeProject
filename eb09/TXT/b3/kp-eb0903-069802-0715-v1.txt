BIRD, William, an English composer, and one of the best organists of his time, was born about 1540, and died at London, 4th July 1623. He was appointed organist of Lincoln cathedral in 1563; and in 1575 he and his master Tallis were gentlemen of the chapel royal, and organists to Queen Elizabeth. Bird was the earliest English composer of madrigals, and some of his numerous sacred compositions are still much esteemed. Most of them were published during his lifetime under a patent from Queen Elizabeth, which secured to him and Tallis the sole right to print and sell music. Between 1575 and 1611 there were issued under this patent eight different collections of his works, with such titles as Cantiones Sacroe ; Gradualia; Psalmes, Songs, and Sonets, <fcc. The vocal canon Non nobis Domine, generally attributed to him, is well known, and often sung. He also wrote a number of pieces for Queen Elizabeth’s Virginal Book, and other similar collections. In his compositions there is a freedom and elegance rarely found in the music of his period. A full account of Bird’s life by E. F. Rimbault is prefixed to one of his Masses, published by the Musical Antiquarian Society.
