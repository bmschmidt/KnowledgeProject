BODLEY, Sir Thomas, founder of the Bodleian library at Oxford, was born at Exeter in 1544. When he was about twelve years of age, his father, John Bodley, being obliged to leave the kingdom on account of his Protestant principles, settled with his family at Geneva, and continued there till the death of Queen Mary. In that university, then in its infancy, young Bodley studied under several eminent professors. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth he returned with his father to England, and was soon after entered of Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1563 he took the degree of bachelor of arts, and the year following was admitted a fellow of Merton College. In 1565 he read a Greek lecture in the hall of that college, took the degree of master of arts the year after, and read natural philosophy in the public schools. In 1569 he was one of the proctors of the university, and for some time after officiated as public orator. Quitting Oxford in 1576, he made the tour of Europe; and on returning to his college after four years absence he applied himself to historical and political studies. He became gentleman-usher to Queen Elizabeth; and in 1585 he married Anne Ball, a widow lady of considerable fortune, whose father, named Carew, was of Bristol. He was soon after sent as ambassador to the king of Denmark, and to several German princes. He was next despatched on a secret mission to France; and in 1588 he went as ambassador to the United Provinces. On his return to England in 1597, finding his preferment obstructed by the jarring interests of Burleigh and Essex, he retired from court, and could never afterwards be prevailed on to accept of any public employment. He now began the foundation of the Bodleian library; and soon after the accession of King James I. he received the honour of knighthood. He died at his house in London, January 28, 1612, and was buried in ths choir of Merton College chapel, where a monument of black and white marble was erected to him, on which stands his effigy in a scholarâ€™s gown, surrounded with books. Sir Thomas wrote his own life to the year 1609, which, with the first draught of the Statutes and his Letters, has been published from the originals in the Bodleian library, by Hearn, under the title of Reliquioe Bodleianoe, or Authentic Remains of Sir Thomas Bodley, London, 1793, 8vo. For a particular account of the Bodleian library, see Libraries.
