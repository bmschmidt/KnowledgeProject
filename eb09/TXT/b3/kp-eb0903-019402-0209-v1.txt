BACCHIGLIONE, a river of north-eastern Italy, which, rising in the mountains eastward of Trent, passes by Vicenza and Padua, and, after a course of 90 miles, falls into the lagune of Venice, south of Chioggia. It is navigable for large boats as far as Vicenza, and is connected with the Adige by means of a canal. The river is probably the ancient Togisonus.
