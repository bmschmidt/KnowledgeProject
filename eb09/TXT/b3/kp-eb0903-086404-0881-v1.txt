BOISSONADE, Jean François, French classical scholar, was born at Paris, 12th August 1774. In 1792 he entered the public service during the administration of General Dumouriez. Driven from it in 1795, he was restored by Lucien Bonaparte, during whose time of office he served as secretary to the prefecture of the Upper Marne. Hethen definitively resigned public employment and devoted himself to the study of Greek, for which he had always a strong inclination. In 1809 he was named professor of Greek at the faculty of letters at Paris, though he did not assume the title till the death of Larcher, who held the chair, in 1812. In 1828 he succeeded Gail in the chair of Greek at the College de France. He also held the offices of librarian of the Bibliothèque du Roi, and perpetual secretary of the Academy of Inscriptions. He died 12th September 1857. Boissonade’s works consist mainly of editions of several less known classical writers, such as Philostratus, Marinus, Eunapius, Aristaenetus. Perhaps his most widely known editions are those of Babrius (1844), and of Tzetzes (1851). The Anecdota Groeea, 5 vols. (1829-33), and Aneedota Nova (1844) contain many interesting and comparatively unknown writings. Boissonade was a contributor to the Journal des Débats and other critical journals, and a selection of his papers has been published by M. Colincamp, Critique littéraire sous le premier Empire, 2 vols., 1863.
