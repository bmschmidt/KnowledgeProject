BLACKLOCK, Thomas, a Scottish poet and divine, was born of humble but respectable parents at Annan, in Dumfriesshire, in 1721. When not quite six months old he lost his sight by the smallpox. Under this misfortune, his father and friends endeavoured to amuse him as he grew up by reading to him Various books,—among others, the works of Milton, Spenser, Prior, Pope, and Addison. Shortly after the death of his father, which took place in 1740, some of Blacklock’s poems began to be handed about among his acquaintances and friends, and a few specimens were brought under the notice of Dr Stevenson of Edinburgh, who was struck by their merits, and formed the design of giving the author a classical education. Blacklock, in consequence, was enrolled a student of divinity in the university of Edinburgh in 1741, and continued his studies under the patronage of Dr Stevenson till 1745, when he retired to Dumfries, and resided there until the close of the civil war. When peace had been restored, he returned to the university, and during this residence in Edinburgh he made the acquaintance of several literary men, in particular of Hume, who was extremely useful to him in the publication by subscription of the 4to edition of his poems in 1756. Two editions in 8vo had previously been published at Edinburgh, in 1746 and in 1754. After applying closely for a considerable time to the study of theology, he was in'1762 ordained minister of the church of Kirkcudbright; but owing to an opposition to the appointment on the part of the parishioners, he resigned his right to the living, and accepted a moderate annuity in its stead. In 1767 the degree of doctor in divinity was conferred on him by Marischal College, Aberdeen. He died on the 7th of July 1791. His poems are pleasing but weak effusions, and there is nothing remarkable about them save that they were written by one who laboured under the misfortune of blindne33.
