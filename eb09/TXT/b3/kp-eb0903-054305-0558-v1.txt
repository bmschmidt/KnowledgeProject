BELLA !, or Bellay, Guillaume du, lord of Langey, a French general, who signalized himself in the service of Francis I., was bom at Glatigny in 1491. He was considered the ablest captain of the time, and his great abilities as a negotiator occasioned the remark of the Emperor Charles V., that “Langey’s pen had fought more against him than all the lances in France.” He was sent in 1537 as viceroy into Piedmont, where he took several towns from the imperialists. His address in penetrating into the most secret designs of the enemy was extraordinary, and he spared no expense for that end. He was extremely active in influencing some of the universities of France to give a judgment agreeable to the desires of Henry VIII., when that prince wished to divorce his queen in order to marry Anne Boleyn. Langey composed several works, the most remarkable of which was the history of his own times (Mémoires, 1753, 7 vols.) He died in 1543, and was buried in the church of Mans, where a noble monument was erected to his memory.
