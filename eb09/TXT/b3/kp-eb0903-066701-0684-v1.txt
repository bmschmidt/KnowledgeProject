BIELAYA TSERKOV (‰e., White Church), a township of Russia, in the government of Kieff, 32 miles S.S.W. of Vasilko, on the main road from Kieff to the Crimea, in 49° 47' N. lat. and 30° 7' E. long. First mentioned in 1155, Bielaya Tserkov was destroyed during the Mongolian invasion, but afterwards recovered its prosperity. In 1550 a castle was built in the town by Prince Pιunsky, waiwode of Keiff, and various immunities were bestowed on the inhabitants. A Polish army occupied the place in 1651, and from that time it was alternately subject to Poland and to independent hetmans. In 1774 it received a charter from Stanislas Augustus, and in 1793 was united to Russia. The principal buildings of Bielaya Tserkov include two Greek churches, one Roman Catholic church, two synagogues, a hospital, and a gymnasium (founded in 1846). In commercial activity the town only yields to Kieff, Berdicheff, and Uman—the chief articles of trade being cattle and grain. There are eleven annual fairs, three of which last for ten days each. The sales at these fairs amount to upwards of £28,000. Population in 1860, 12,075, of whom 7349 are Jews.
