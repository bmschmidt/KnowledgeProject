BIENHOA, the capital of one of the six provinces of Lower Cochin-China, situated about 20 miles to the northwest of Saigon, on a canal that connects it with that city. It was captured by the French admiral Bonard in 1861, and is now one of the fortified posts in the French possessions. Sugar-mills were started in 1869 by an English company; but, owing to the jealousy of the Anamites, they had soon to be closed. The population of the “Inspection” of Bienhoa is 19,260.
