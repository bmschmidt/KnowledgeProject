BEACONSFIELD, a market-town in the county of Buckingham, 23 miles from London, on the road to Oxford. It consists of four streets crossing each other at right angles, and before the opening of the railways was rather a busy place. At one time, indeed, it was the seat of a considerable manufacture of ribbons. The poet Waller and Edmund Burke lived in the neighbourhood, and both are buried in the town. Beaconsfield gave the title of viscountess to the late wife of the Right Hon. B. Disraeli. Population of parish in 1871, 1524.
