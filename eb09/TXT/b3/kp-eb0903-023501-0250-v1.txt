BAGHMATI, a river of Hindustan, which has its source in the hills to the north of Katmandu, the capital of Nepâl, whence it flows in a southerly direction through the district of Tirhut in the province of Behar, and, receiving the waters of the Buchiâ on its north bank, and of Burâ Gandak on its south bank, joins the Ganges, after a course of 285 miles, in 25° 23' N. lat. and 86° 34' E. long., about 8 miles below the town of Monghir, but on the opposite bank.
