BARBERINI, the title of a powerful family, originally of Tuscan extraction, who settled in Florence during the early part of the 11th century. They acquired great wealth and influence, and in 1623 Maffeo Barberini was raised to the papal throne as Urban VIII. He made his brother, Antonio, and two nephews, cardinals, and gave to a third nephew. Taddeo, the principality of Palestrina. Great jealousy of their increasing power was excited amongst the neighbouring princes, and Odoardo Farnese, duke of Parma, made war upon Taddeo and defeated the papal troops. After the death of Urban in 1644 his successor, Innocent X., showed hostility to the Barberini family. Taddeo fled to Paris, where he died in 1647; but the others after a short period returned to Italy and had their property restored. The principality of Palestrina is still in the hands of the family; and their magnificent palace and library at Rome give evidence of their wealth and magnificence.
