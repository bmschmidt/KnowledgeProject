BELPASSO, a town of Sicily, on the slopes of Etna, in the province of Catania, and about 8 miles from the city of that name. In 1669 it was destroyed by an eruption. The inhabitants rebuilt their town on a new site at Mezzo Campo, but, finding the locality unhealthy, they afterwards returned to their original position. Population, 7620.
