BEAUHARNAIS, Eugène. de, step-sen of Napoleon I., was born at Paris, September 3, 1781. His father, the λ ieomte Alexander de Beauharnais, had been a member of the National Convention, and for soma time commanded the republican army of the north. Hie want of success in the field, however, brought him under the suspicion of the Revolutionary leaders; he was tried on a charge of treason, and was executed on 23d June 1794. After the marriage of Napoleon with the Vicomtesse Josephine Beauharnais, her son Eugène accompanied the army of Italy and acted as aide-de-camp to his step-father, by whom he was treated with the greatest affection and favour. He was rapidly promoted; and after the establishment of the empire, was made prince and viceroy of Italy. In 1806 he was adopted by Napoleon. During the great campaign of 1809 he had the command of the Italian army, and by his skilful conduct materially contributed to the success of the emperor. In 1812 he commanded a corps of the grand army; and after the departure of Napoleon and flight of Murat, had the entire charge of the broken French forces. The disastrous campaigns of 1813 and 1814 deprived him of his viceroyalty, and he retired to Munich, the capital of the king of Bavaria, whose daughter he had married in 1806. There he continued to reside, with the title of duke of Leuchtenberg, till his death in 1824.
