BALDINGER, Ebnest Gottfried, a German physician of considerable eminence, and the author of a great number of medical publications, was born near Erfurt, 13th May 1738. He studied medicine at Erfurt, Halle, and Jena, and in 1761 was intrusted with the superintendence of the military hospitals connected with the Prussian encampment near Torgau. He published, in 1765, a dissertation on the diseases of soldiers, which met with so favourable a reception that he published an enlarged edition, under the title of Treatise on the Diseases that prevail in Armies, Langensalza, 1774, 8vo. In 1768 he became professor of medicine at Jena, whence he removed, in 1773, to Göttingen, and in 1785 to Marburg, where he died of apoplexy on the 21st of January 1804. Among his pupils were Akermann. Sömmering, and Blumenbach. Some eighty-four separate treatises are mentioned as having proceeded from his pen, in addition to numerous papers scattered through various collections and journals.
