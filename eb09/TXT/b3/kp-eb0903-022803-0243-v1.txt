BADNUR, the headquarters of the district of Betül, consists, besides the European houses, of two bâzârs. The largest, the Kothi Bâzâr, has a population of 2015 souls. The public buildings are the Commissioner’s court-house, the district court-house, the jail, the schools, the policestation, the post-office, the dispensary, &c. There is a good sardi or inn for native travellers, and a dàk bangalow or resting-place for Europeans.
