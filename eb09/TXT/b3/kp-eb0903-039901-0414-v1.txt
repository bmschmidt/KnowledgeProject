BARROW'S STRAITS, a portion of the channel which runs W. from Baffin’s Bay through the islands of the Arctic archipelago to Melville Sound. It lies between 73° 45' and 74° 40' N. lat., is about 200 miles in length, and has an average breadth of 60 or 70 miles. In many places it is upwards of 200 fathoms in depth. The coasts on both sides are generally steep and rugged, with numerous bays and inlets, the most important of which is the Prince Regent Inlet, which runs S. into the Gulf of Boothia.
