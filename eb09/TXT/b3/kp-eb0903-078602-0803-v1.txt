BIRON, Charles de Gontault, son of the above and born in 1562, created duke of Biron and admiral of France by Henry IV., was a man of great intrepidity, but fickle and treacherous. In 1601 he was sent as ambassador to the court of queen Elizabeth to announce his royal master’s marriage with Maιy of Medici; but being discovered in a treasonable correspondence with Spain, he was beheaded in the Bastille at Paris, July 31, 1602. The extent to which he had carried his treason was not great, and Henry by sparing his life would not have shown undue clemency.
