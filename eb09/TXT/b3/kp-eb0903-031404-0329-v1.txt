BANIALUKA, a town and fortress of Turkey, in the eyalet of Bosnia, situated on the Verbas or Verbitza, a navigable tributary of the Save. Its warm baths, for which it is still known, would seem, from the antiquities discovered on the spot, to have been frequented by the Romans. There are upwards of forty mosques in the town, and one of them is regarded as the finest in Turkey. An active trade is carried on, and gunpowder and cloth are manufactured, while in the neighbourhood silver-mining is also prosecuted with success. Banialuka was for a long time the seat of the Bosnian governors, and has been frequently exposed to the vicissitudes of war. In 1688 it was captured for the Austrians by Louis of Baden. Population, 15,000.
