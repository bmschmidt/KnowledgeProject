BEDARRIEUX, a town of France, in the department of Hérault, situated on the River Orb, with a station on the branch railway from Béziers to Graissesac. It is a neat and well-built town, and carries on a variety of industries, among the most important of which are the weaving of cotton and woollen cloth and the manufacture of hats, paper, leather, and oil; while at Clairac in the neighbourhood there are glass-works and a copper-foundry. Most of the produce is exported to Africa and the Levant. Not far from the town there is a thermal establishment open all the year round. In the end of the 18th century the population was only 250; in 1872 it was 8985.
