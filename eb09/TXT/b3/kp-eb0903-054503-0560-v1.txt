BELLENDEN, John, a Scotch poet, and the translator of Boece’s History, was born about the beginning of the 16th century, probably in East Lothian. He appears to have been educated, first at the University of St Andrews and then at that of Paris, where he took the degree of doctor. From his own statement we learn that he had been in the service of James V. from the king’s earliest years, and that the post he held was clerk of accounts. It was at the request of James that he undertook his translations of Boece and of Livy. As a reward for his labours he was appointed to the archdeaconry of Moray, and was also made a canon of Ross. Bellenden, who was a strenuous opponent of the Reformation, is said to have died at Rome in 1550. His translation of Boece, which is a remarkable specimen of Scottish prose, distinguished by its freedom and vigour of expression, appears to have been first published in 1536. The best edition is that superintended by Mr Maitland, 2 vols. 4to, Edin., 1821. The same gentleman edited for the first time (Edin., 1822) Bellenden’s translation of Livy, which extends only to the first five books. The few poetical remains exhibit considerable taste and skill in versification.
