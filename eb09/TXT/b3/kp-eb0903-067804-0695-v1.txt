BINGEN, the ancient Bingium, a town of the grandduchy of Hesse-Darmstadt, in the province of Rhenish Hesse, 15 miles W. of Mentz. It is situated almost opposite Riidesheim. on the left bank of the Rhine, at the commence of the Nahe (or Nava), which is crossed near its mouth by an iron railway bridge resting on old Roman foundations. A considerable trade is carried on in wine, grain, and cattle; and tobacco, starch, and leather are manufactured. A short way down the Rhine is the Bingerloch, a famous whirlpool, the dangers of which were almost removed by blastings undertaken by the Prussian Government in 1834; while about half-way between it and the town rises on a rock, in the middle of the stream, the tower of Bishop Hatto. On a height immediately to the south-east is the ruined castle of Klopp, originally founded by Drusus, and higher still on the Rochusberg the celebrated chapel of St Roch. Population in 1871, 5938.
