BALLINASLOE, a town of Ireland, province of Connaught, 91 miles W.S.W. of Dublin. The River Suck, an affluent of the Shannon, divides it into two parts; the western being in the county of Galway, the eastern in the county of Roscommon. They are connected by two bridges and a causeway across an island. The town is clean and well built, and contains a handsome church, with a singular octagonal spire springing from scrolls. There are Roman Catholic and Methodist chapels, several public schools, a district lunatic asylum, union workhouse, market-house, a savings bank (established in 1822), several flour-mills, and breweries. In the neighbourhood is Garbally Castle, the seat of the earl of Clancarty. A great annual cattle fair is held here from the 5th to the 9th of October. Its importance may be judged from the fact, that in 1874 there were exposed for sale 18,018 horned cattle and 65,130 sheep. The Western Star is published in the town. Population in 1871, 4619.
