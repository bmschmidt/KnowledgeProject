BIBIRINE, or Bebeerine, an alkaloil obtained from the bark and fruit of the greenheart tree, Nectandra Rodioei, called bibiru or sipiri in Guiana, where the tree grows. The alkaloid was discovered about the year 1835 by Hugh Rodie, a surgeon resident in Demerara, who found it possessed great efficacy as a febrifuge, and it was recommended by him as a substitute for quinine. The sulphate of bibirine has a place in the British pharmacopoeia, and is in considerable use in medicine as a bitter tonic and febrifuge. Bibirine has been shown by Walz to be apparently identical with an alkaloid obtained from the common box, Buxus sempervirens, called buxine, and this opinion is to some extent confirmed by Dr Fliickiger. The sulphate of bibirine found in commerce is a dark brown substance in thin translucent scales.
