BLANC, Mont, the highest, and in other respects one of the most remarkable mountains in Europe, is situated in that division of the great Alpine system known as the Pennine Alp3, in 45° 49' 58" N. lat. and 6° 51' 54* E. long. It rises almost in the shape of a pyramid to the height of 15,780 feet, and is visible at a distance of 130 miles to the west. The mass of the mountain is composed of granite, covered with strata of schist3 and limestones. To the N.E. lies the beautiful vale of Chamouni, and on the S.W. the Allée Blanche. Of the numerous glaciers that send their ice-3treams down its sides the most remarkable is the Mer de Glace, which winds down its northern slope towards Chamouni, and gives birth to the River Arve. The ascent of Mont Blanc was first accomplished in 1786 by a guide named Jacques Balmat, who shortly afterwards led Dr Paccard, a local physician, to the summit, and thus gave him the honour of being the first person of scientific education to make known the possibility of the undertaking. De Saussure, the naturalist, ascended in the following year, and when the Italian naturalist Imperiale do Sant-Angelo made the ascent in 1840 he had been preceded by thirty-three known travellers. The whole journey to the top and back can now be accomplished in 50 or 60 hours; but in general the view can hardly be said to be worth the fatigue, the extreme height of the position, even when the outlook is unclouded, rendering the prospect indistinct. For authorities and map3, see Alps, vol. i. pp. 635-6.
