BELPER, a market-town of Derbyshire, situated on the banks of the Derwent, which is here crossed by a stone bridge. It is 7 miles north of Derby, on the Midland Railway. For a considerable period one of the most flourishing towns in the country, it is principally indebted for its prosperity to the establishment of cotton-works by Messrs Strutt in 1777. It also manufactures linens, silks, hosiery, nails, and earthenwares; it has three churches, several chapels for Independents, Methodists, Baptists, &c., a mechanicsâ€™ institution, and a subscription library. In the neighbourhood are the remains of a mansion where John of Gaunt used to reside. Population (1871), 8527.
