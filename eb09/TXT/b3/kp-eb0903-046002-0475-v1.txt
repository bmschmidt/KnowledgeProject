BDELLIUM, a fragrant gum-resin of a dark-reddish colour, bitter and pungent to the taste. It is closely allied to myrrh, and like it is produced from one or more species of Balsamodendron,— the Googul resin, or Indian bdellium, yielded by B. mukul, being considered by Dr Birdwood to be the bdellium of Scripture, and the∕3δeλλιov of Dioscorides. Bdellium is little imported into Europe, but it is extensively used in Indian pharmacy, both human and veterinary; and it is, like myrrh, employed for incense in temples. A variety of the gum-resin known as African bdellium is produced on the East African coast, but nothing is certainly known regarding its botanical source.
