BISCEGLIA, perhaps the ancient Natiolum, a fortified seaport of Italy, in the province of Terra di Bari, situated on a rocky promontory on the Adriatic, 21 miles W.N.W. of Bari. It is the seat of a bishopric, and has a cathedral, numerous churches and convents, and a theatre. Some ruins still exist of a hospital, founded by Bohemund for pilgrims to the Holy Land. Its harbour is only accessible to small vessels, and it has little trade. Being destitute of springs, it has numerous reservoirs for the collection of rain-water. Population, 21,371.
