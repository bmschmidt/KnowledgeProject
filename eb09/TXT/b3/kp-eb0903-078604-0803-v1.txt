BISACCIA, a city of Italy, in the Principato Ulteriore, 60 miles E. of Naples. It is a bishopric in conjunction with St Angelo, and contains 5342 inhabitants. Formerly it was the chief city in a principality belonging to the Pignatelli family, and it is believed to occupy the site of the ancient Romulea, a Samnite town of considerable size, which was captured by the Romans about 297 b.c.
