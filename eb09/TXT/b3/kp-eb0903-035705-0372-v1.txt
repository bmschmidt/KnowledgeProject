BARANYA, a province in the kingdom of Hungary, extending over 1960 square miles. It lies in the angle formed at the junction of the Danube and the Drave, is traversed by offshoots of the Styrian Alps, and contains one city, 13 market-towns, and 341 villages. The inhabitants number about 283,500, and consist of Magyars, Germans, Croatians, and Servians, a large proportion being Roman Catholics. The greater part of the land is fertile, but a portion of it is marshy and unhealthy. The chief products are corn, wine, flax, tobacco, asparagus, and potash. Warm springs are found at Tapolcza, ι Sikl0s, and Harkany. There are some valuable quarries of marble and millstones, and numerous coal-mines. The rearing of sheep [9:3:358] and swine is largely engaged in. The province is subdivided into six circles. The capital is Fünfkirchen, with a population of 23,863.
