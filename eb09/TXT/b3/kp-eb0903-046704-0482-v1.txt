BEAUMANOIR, Philippe de, a distinguished writer on French law, was born in the early part of the 13th century, and died in 1296. The few facts known regarding his life are to be gathered from legal documents in which his name occurs. From these it appears that in 1273 ho filled the post of bailli at Senlis,and in 1280 held a similar office at Clermont. He is also occasionally referred to as presiding at the assizes held at various towns.. His great work is entitled Coutumes de Beauvoisis, and was first published by De la Thaumassi√®re in 1690. A second edition, with introduction, was published by Beugnot in 1842. It is regarded as one of the best works bearing on old French law, and was frequently referred to with high admiration by Montesquieu.
