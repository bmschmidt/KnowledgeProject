BESKOW, Bernhard von, Baron, the Swedish dramatist, was born at Stockholm, April 19, 1796. Beskow’s first book, Poetical Efforts, published in 1818, made a favourable impression with the public, and he wrote the prize poem for the Swedish Academy some years later. His dramas, however, are his chief claim to remembrance; the best are Torkel Knutsson, Erik XIV., Birger and his Race, and Gustavus Adolphus in Germany. Torkel Knutsson is considered the finest drama that Swedish literature possesses. In the highest sense of the word, these are not, however, dramas at all, since they lack unity and fail in the development of character, but they are grandiose historical s tudies in a dramatic form. Beskow’s poetry is over-decorated with phrases, and becomes the prey of sonorous antithesis. Besides lyrical and dramatic poetry, Baron von Beskow distinguished him3elf in history, philosophy, politics, and travels. In 1828 he was elected president of the Swedish Academy, and became an enthusiastic and liberal patron of national poetry and art. (Ehlenschläger translated his dramas into Danish, and various persons rendered them into German. He died on the 17th of October 1868.
