BERKELEY, a market-town in the county of Gloucester, near the River Severn, on the Midland Railway. It is pleasantly situated on a gentle eminence, in a rich pastoral vale to which it gives name, and which is celebrated for its dairies, producing the famous cheese known as “double Gloucester.” The town has a handsome church, a grammar school, a town-hall, a market-house, and some trade in coal, timber, malt, and cheese. Berkeley was the birthplace of the celebrated Dr Jenner, whose remains are interred in the church. Berkeley castle, on an eminence S.E. of the town, was built in the reign of Henry I. out of the ruins of a nunnery which had been in existence some time before the Conquest. It suffered considerably during the civil wars of the 17th century, but is still one of the noblest baronial castles existing in England. It is noted as the scene of the barbarous murder of Edward II. Since the time of Henry II. it has been in the hands of the Berkeley family. Population of the parish in 1871, 4607,—about a fourth of the number being in the town.
