BEHRING’S STRAIT, the narrow sea between the N.E. part of Asia and the N.W. part of North America, connecting the North Pacific with the Arctic Ocean. .At the narrowest part, East Cape in Asia approaches within about 36 miles of Cape Prince of Wales on the American shore. The former is in 66° 6' N. lat., 169 c 38' W. long.; and the latter in 65° 46' N. lat., 168° 15' W. long. North [9:3:510] and south of these points the coasts on both sides rapidly diverge. They are steep and rocky, and considerably indented. The Asiatic coast, extending from Cape Serdtzy to Cape Chukotzky, a distance of about 400 miles, presents several large and commodious bays. The strait is in general from 23 to 30 fathoms in depth, and contains a few small islands known as the Diomede Islands. Haze and fogs greatly prevail, and the temperature is low. The strait derives its name from Vitus Bering or Behring, a German in the Russian service, who discovered it in the year 1728. It was subsequently explored and described with great accuracy by Captain Cook, in 1788. (See Arctic Papers for Expedition of 1875.)
