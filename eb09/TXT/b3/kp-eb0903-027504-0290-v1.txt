BALDUINUS, Jacobus, a distinguished professor of civil law in the university of Bologna. He was by birth a Bolognese, and is reputed to have been of a noble family. He was a pupil of Azo, and the master of Odofredus, of Hostiensis, and of Jacobus de Ravanis, the last of whom has the reputation of having first applied dialectical forms to legal science. His great fame as a jurist caused him to be elected podest√† of the city of Genoa, where he was intrusted with the reform of the laws of the republic. He died at Bologna in 1225, and has left behind him some treatises on Procedure, which have the merit of being the earliest of their kind.
