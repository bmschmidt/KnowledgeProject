BISHOP-STORTFOBD, a market-town of England, on the eastern border of Herts, 11 miles E.N.E. of Hertford, and 32 miles by railway from London. It is situated on both sides of the River Stort, a tributary of the Lea, and has thus direct water communication with the metropolis. The parish church of St Michaelâ€™s, a fine building with a spire, dates from the reign of Henry VI., but was partly rebuilt in 1820. A town-house, a corn exchange, a union workhouse, a high school, a collegiate school, and a diocesau training school, are among the chief buildings; and there are also public baths, libraries, and banks. The industrial establishments comprise a brewery, malt-houses, coachworks, lime-kilns, and a foundry; and the trade consists chiefly in grain and malt. Stortford was in existence before the Norman conquest; and its castle, known as Waytemore Castle, was presented by William the Conqueror to Maurice, bishop of London, and his successors. The building was, however, demolished by King John, and only a few ruins remain. Sir H. Chauncey, the historian of Hertfordshire, and Hoole, the translator of Tasso, were both natives of Stortford. Population of the parish in 1871, 6250.
