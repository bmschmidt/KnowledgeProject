BOGODUKHOFF, a town of Russia, in the government of Kharkoff, about 43 miles N.W. of that city, in 50° 10' N. lat. and 36° 32' E. long., on the sandstone heights along the River Merl. There seems to have been a settlement on this site as early as 1571, andin 1681 it is spoken of as a town. In 1709, at the time of the Swedish war, Bogodukhoff was taken by Menschikoff and the Emperor Alexis Petrovitch. There are still remains of the ramparts and ditches with which it was formerly surrounded. The town contains four churches and a cathedral (of the Assumption, built in 1793), a hospital, and an almshouse. The inhabitants are chiefly engaged in agriculture and gardening, and in the manufacture of boots, caps, and furred gowns. Tanning also is carried on to some extent. The trade is principally in grain, cattle, and fish. There are two weekly markets and six annual fairs. Population in 1860, 10,522
