BALFOUR, Sir James, Bart., of Denmylne and Kinnaird z an eminent annalist and antiquary, was born about 1600. He received a good education, travelled for some time on the Continent, and then devoted his attention almost entirely to the study of the history and antiquities of his country. He was well acquainted with Sir Wm. Segar and with Dugdale, to whose Monasticon he contributed. He was knighted by Charles I. in 1630, was made lyon king-at-arms in the same year, and in 1633 received the baronetcy of Kinnaird. He was removed from his office of king-at-arms by Cromwell, and died in 1657. Some of his works, which are very numerous, are preserved in the Advocates’ Library at Edinburgh, together with his correspondence,—from which rich collection Mr Haig published Balfour’s Annales of Scotland from the zeire 1057-1603, in 4 vols. 8vo. (1824-25). See Sibbald, Memoria Bdlfourιana, 1699.
