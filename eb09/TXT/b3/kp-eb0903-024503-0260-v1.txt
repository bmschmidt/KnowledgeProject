BAINBRIDGE, Dr John, physician and astronomer, was born at Ashby-de-la-Zouche, in Leicestershire, in the year 1582. He taught a grammar school for some years, and practised physic, employing his leisure hours in astronomy, which was his favourite study. After removing to London he was admitted a Fellow of the College of Physicians, and gained considerable reputation by his description of the comet in 1618. The next year Sir Henry Savile appointed Bainbridge his first professor of astronomy at Oxford; and the masters and fellows of Merton College made him first junior, and then superior, reader of Linacre’s lecture. He died in 1643. His published works are—1. An Astronomical Description of the late Comet, Lond. 1619. 2. Procli Sphcera, 1620. 3. Canicularia ; a Treatise concerning the Canicular Days, Oxford, 1648. Several of his unpublished writings exist in manuscript in the library of Trinity College, Dublin.
