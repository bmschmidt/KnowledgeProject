ATOOI, one of the larger Sandw ich Islands, in the North Pacific Ocean. Towards the N.E. and N.W. the country is rugged and broken, but to the southward it is more level. The hills rise from the sea with a gentle acclivity, and, at a little distance back, are covered with wood; the central peaks attain an elevation of 7000 feet. The chief ports are Waimea and Hanalei. The island was one of the stations chosen for the observation of the transit of Venus in 1874. It is nearly 40 mile3 in length, and contains about 10,000 inhabitants. Long. 159° 40 W., lat. 21° 57' N.
