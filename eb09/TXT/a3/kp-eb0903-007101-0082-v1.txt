AUGEIAS (Αυγείας, Aυγεας, cf. ηλίου αυγή), in Greek Legend, a son of Helios, the sun. He was a prince of Elis, and, consistently with his being a descendant of the sun-god, had an immense wealth of herds, including twelve bulls sacred to Helios, and white as swans. He lived beside the stream Menios (flηv = moon); and his daughter Agamede was, like Medeia and Circe, skilled in witchcraft, and connected with the moon goddess. The task of Hercules was to clear out all his stalls in one day, and without help. This he did by making an opening in the wall and turning the stream through them. Augeias had promised him a tenth of the herd, but refused this, alleging that Hercules had acted only in the service of Eurystheus.
