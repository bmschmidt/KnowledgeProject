ATHY, a market-town of Ireland, county of Kildare, 34 miles S.W. of Dublin. It is a station on the Great Southern and Western Railway, and is intersected by the river Barrow, which is here crossed by a bridge of five arches. It has a church, a Roman Catholic chapel, a Presbyterian and a Methodist meeting-house, court-house, jail, two banks, hospital, dispensary, barracks, <fcc. Adjoining the town is a small chapel, an ancient cemetery, and a small Dominican monastery. Previous to the Union it returned two members to the Irish parliament. The principal trade is in corn, which is ground at the neigh-bouriug mills. Population in 1871, 4510.

ΑΤΙΜΑ, a town of Naples, province of Terra di Lavoro, near the Melfa, and 12 miles S.E. of Sora. It has a cathedra], convent, and hospital, with about 5000 inhabitants; but it is chiefly remarkable for its ancient remains, consisting of portions of its walls, the ruins of an extensive aqueduct, and numerous other structures, besides monuments and inscriptions. The city is of great antiquity, and was a place of importance down to the days of the Roman empire. It is remarkable now, as of old, for the exceptional coolness of its situation.
