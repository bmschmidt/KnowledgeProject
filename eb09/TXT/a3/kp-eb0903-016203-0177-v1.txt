AYAMONTE, a fortified city of Spain, in the province of Huelva, on the left bank of the Guadiana, about 2 miles from its mouth. The harbour is good, but, on account of a bar at its mouth, it is of difficult entrance. The principal employment of the inhabitants is afforded by the fisheries, especially for sardince, tunny, cod, and horse-mackerel; but this branch of industry has suffered by the extension of the general coasting traffic. Silk-weaving is carried on. Ayamonte is said to have had in the 16th century 16,000 inhabitants. Population, 5960.
