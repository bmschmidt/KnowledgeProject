AVERSA, a town of Italy, province of Terra di Lavoro, situated in a beautiful plain covered with orange-groves and vineyards, about midway between Naples and Capua. It is the seat of a wealthy bishopric, and its foundling hospital and lunatic asylum, the latter founded by Murat, are very celebrated. Aversa owed its origin to the Normans, and dates from 1030, the people of the ancient city of Atelia being transported thither. Population, 21,176.
