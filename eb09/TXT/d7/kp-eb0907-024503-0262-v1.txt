DIOGENES, of Apollonia in Crete, a celebrated natural philosopher who flourished at Athens about 460 B.c. He was a pupil of Anaximenes and a contemporary of A naxagoras. The fragments of his writings have been collected together by Panzerbieter. He believed air to be the source of all being, and all other substances to be derived from it by condensation and rarefaction. His chief advance upon the doctrines of his master is that he asserted air, the primal force, to be intelligence—“the air which stirred within him not only prompted but instructed. The air as the origin of all things is necessarily an eternal, imperishable substance, but as soul it is also necessarily endowed with consciousness.” Mr Lewes and Mr Grote assign to him a higher place in the evolution of philosophy than either Hegel or Schwegler.
