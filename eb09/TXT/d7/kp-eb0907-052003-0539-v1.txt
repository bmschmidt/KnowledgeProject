DULCIGNO, a town of Turkey in Europe, in the Albanian sanjak of Scutari, occupying a bold promontory on the Adriatic, eighteen miles W.S.W. of the town of Scutari. It has a strong castle, is the seat of a Catholic bishop, and numbers about 8000 inhabitants, who are mainly engaged in agriculture, but also carry on a little ship-building and a certain amount of foreign commerce. The Turkish Olkin, or Olgun, preserves more distinctly the ancient name of Olcinium, by which Dulcigno was known to the Romans, who obtained possession of it about 167 b.c. during the war with Gentius, the Illyrian king. In modern history the town is noted for the defeat of the Venetians in 1718; and its inhabitants were long remarkable for their piracies.
