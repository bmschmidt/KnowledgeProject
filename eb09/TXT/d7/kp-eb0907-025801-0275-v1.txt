DISCUS, a quoit, or circular plate of stone or metal, 10 or 12 inches in diameter, which was used by the ancient Greeks and Romans for throwing to a distance as a gymnastic exercise. Sometimes a kind of quoit of a spherical form was used for the same purpose; and through a hole in its centre a thong was passed, to assist the player in throwing it. Statius, in Theb., vi. 646-721, fully explains the manner in which the discus was used. In the British Museum there is a copy of a famous statue by Myron of a discobolus in the act of throwing the discus.
