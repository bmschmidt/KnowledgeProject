DUBROVNA, a town of European Russia, in the government of Mogileff, 11 miles east of Orsha, on the highway to Smolensk, in 54° 34' N. lat. and 30° 4Γ 9'' E. long. Its wooden houses are ranged for the most part along the left bank of the Dnieper, and in the neighbourhood of the two streams Dubrovenka and Svinka; and among its public buildings are six orthodox churches, a Roman Catholic chapel, a synagogue, a hospital, and a J ewish high school supported by Government. The town is mentioned at a pretty early date, and frequently appears in the history of the 16th century. In 1514 it requested to be received into allegiance by Vasili Ivanovitch of Moscow; but after his defeat near Orsha it returned to Lithuania. In 1535 it was burned by Vasili Shuiski: [9:7:504] and in 1562, 1563, and 1580 it suffered a similar fate. The population, which is predominantly Jewish, amounts to 7600.
