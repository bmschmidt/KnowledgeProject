DE WITT, Cornelius (1623-1672), brother of the more celebrated John De Witt, was born at Dort in 1623. In 1650 he became burgomaster of his native town, and member of the states of Holland and West Friesland. He was throughout life closely associated with his brother, whose opinions he shared, and whom he supported with great ability and vigour. Of the eight deputies appointed in 1672 to accompany the naval and military commanders, he was the one selected to go with De Ruyter, and in action he displayed remarkable courage, as he had done under similar circumstances, in 1667. Compelled by sickness to leave the fleet, he found on his return to Dort that the revocation of the Perpetual Edict had been signed by his fellow magistrates. He was forced in his sick-room to follow their example, but added after his name the initials V.C. (vi coactus). See next article.
