DUFRÉNOY, Pierre Armand, geologist and mineralogist, was born at Sevran, in the department of Seine-et-Oise, in France, in 1792, and died March 20, 1857. After leaving the Imperial Lyceum in 1811, he studied till 1813 at the Polytechnic School, and then, at the age of twenty-one, entered the corps des mines. In conjunction with M. Elie de Beaumont he in 1∙841 published a great geological map of France, the result of investigations carried on during thirteen years (1823-1836). Five years (1836- 41) were spent in writing the text to accompany the map. The two authors had already together published Voyage métallurgique en Angleterre (1827, 2d ed. 1837-39), Mémoires pour servir à une description géologique de la France (1830- 38), and a Mémoire on Cantal and Mont-Dore (1833). Other literary productions of Dufrénoy are an account of the iron-mines of the eastern Pyrenees (1834), a treatise on mineralogy (1844, 2d ed. 1856-60), and numerous papers contributed to the Annales des Mines and other scientific publications, one of the most interesting of which is entitled Des terrains volcaniques des environs de Naples. Dufrénoy was a member of the Academy of Sciences, a commander of the Legion of Honour, an inspector-general of mines, and professor of geology at H École des Ponts et Chaussées, and of mineralogy at the Imperial School of Mines, of which latter institution he was the director.
