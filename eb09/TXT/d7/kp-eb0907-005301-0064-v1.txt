DELPHINIA, a festival of Apollo held annually on the 7th of the month Munychion (April) at Athens, where he was styled Delphinios. All that is known of the ceremonies is that a number of girls proceeded to his temple carrying suppliantsâ€™ branches and seeking to propitiate Apollo, probably as a god having influence on the sea. It was at this time of year that navigation opened again after the storms of winter.
