DIAMANTINA, formerly Tejuco, a town of Brazil, in the province of Minas-Geraes, is situated at an altitude of 5700 feet above sea-level, in a valley watered by affluents of the Jequitinhonha. Its streets are broad, and the houses are mostly of wood. The public structures include several churches, a theatre, barracks, three hospitals, and a school. The surrounding district is sterile, but is rich in minerals. The discovery of diamonds there was made in 1729. Population about 7000, or, with that of the neighbouring villages, 15,000. See Brazil, vol. iv. p. 224.
