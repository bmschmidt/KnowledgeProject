DRUMMOND, Henry (1786-1860), an English banker, politician, and miscellaneous writer, remarkable for the versatility of his gifts and the eccentricity of his character, was born on the 5th December 1786. He was the eldest son of Henry Drummond, a prominent London banker, by a daughter of the first Lord Melville. He was educated at Harrow and at Christ Church, Oxford. His name is permanently[9:7:480] connected with the university through the chair of political economy, which he founded in 1825. He entered Parliament in early life, and took an active interest from the first in nearly all departments of politics. Thoroughly independent and often eccentric in his views, he yet acted generally with the Conservative party. He was an effective speaker, clear and forcible, and on occasion caustic and severe. From 1847 until his death on the 20th February 1860 he represented West Surrey. Drummond took a deep interest in religious subjects, and published numerous books and pamphlets on such questions as the interpretation of prophecy, the circulation of the Apocrypha, the principles of Christianity, &c., which attracted considerable attention. He was intimately associated with the origin and spread of the Catholic Apostolic or “Irvingite” Church. Stated meetings of those who sympathized with Irving were held for the study of prophecy, between 1826 and 1830 at his seat of Albury Park, in Surrey; he contributed very liberally to the funds of the new church; and he became one of its leading officebearers. The numerous works he wrote in defence of its distinctive doctrines and practice were generally clear and vigorous, if seldom convincing.
