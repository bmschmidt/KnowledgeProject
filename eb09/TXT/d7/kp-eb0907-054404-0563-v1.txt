DUNOIS, Jean (1402-1468), Count of Orleans and Longueville, commonly called the “Bastard of Orleans,” a celebrated French warrior and grand-chamberlain of France, was the natural son of the duke of Orleans (brother of Charles VI.) and Mariette d’Enghien, Madame de Cany, and was bom at Paris the 23d November 1402. He was brought up in the house of the duke, and in the company of his legitimate sons. His earliest feat of arms was the surprise and rout in 1427 of the English, who were besieging Montargis,—the first successful blow against the English power in France following a long series of French defeats. In 1428 he threw himself into Orleans, and was the principal means of enabling the garrison to hold out until the arrival of Joan of Arc, when he shared with her the honour of defeating the enemy there in 1429. He then accompanied Joan to Rheims, and shared in the victory of Patay. After her death he raised the siege of Chartres and of Lagny, and drove the English from Paris, which he entered in triumph on the 13th April 1436. The English retreated gradually into the Isle of France, and thence into Normandy; and Dunois, having in 1449 been raised to the rank of lieutenant-general, soon conquered from them the whole [9:7:545] of that province. In 1451 he attacked them in Guienne, taking among other towns Bordeaux, which the English had held for 300 years. At the conclusion of these conquests Charles VII. legitimated him, and gave him the title of defender of his country, and the office of grand chamberlain; but on the death of Charles, Louis XI. deprived him of his titles and dignities. He then joined the league of revolted princes, but, assuming the function of negotiator, and thus securing the favour of the king, he was reinstated in his offices, and named president of the council for the reform of the state. He died 28th November 1468.
