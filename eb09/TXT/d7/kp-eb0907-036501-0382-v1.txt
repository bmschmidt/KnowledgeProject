DONOVAN, Edward, naturalist, was author of many popular works on natural history and botany. In 1792 appeared the first volume of his Natural History of British Insects, which extended to sixteen volumes, and was completed in 1816. Although now superseded, this compilation did good service in its time. During the same period Donovan published Natural Histories of British Birds, in 10 vols. 8vo. (1799-1819), of British Fishes, in 5 vols. (1802-1808), of British Shells, in 5 vols. (1800-1804), a series of illustrated works on The Insects of India, China, New Holland, dec., in 3 vols. 4to (1798-1805), and Excursions in South Wales and Monmouthshire (1805).

To these works must be added his periodical entitled The Naturalist' 's Repository, a monthly publication, of which three volumes were completed (1823-1825), and an Essay on the Minute Parts of Plants in general. Donovan was author of the articles on natural history in Rees’s Cyclopaedia. In his old age this hard-working student and writer published a Memorial respecting my Publications in Natural History, in which he complains of the small profits accruing to him from the sale of his books. We have searched in vain for any biographical particulars of Donovan,—the only facts apparently recorded being that he was a fellow of the Linnean Society, and that he died in London, February 1, 1837.
