DUBOSSARI, or Novie Dubossari, a town of European Russia, in the government of Kherson, on the left bank of the Dniester, 101 miles from Odessa, in 47° 16' N. lat. and 29° 9' E. long. It occupies a picturesque position, is surrounded by fertile fields and gardens, has two churches, a synagogue, and a public hospital, and contains from 7000 to 8000 inhabitants—Moldavians, Malo-Russians, and Jews—who are mainly dependent on the trade in the local wine and tobacco, though they also deal in timber, cattle, and grain. Dubossari was founded in keeping with the terms of the Russian peace of 1795, and received the epithet Novie, or New, to distinguish it from the old town of Dubossar (Tombasari, or Tymbashari), on the right bank of the Dniester, in Bessarabia, which had been of considerable importance under the Tatar domination.
