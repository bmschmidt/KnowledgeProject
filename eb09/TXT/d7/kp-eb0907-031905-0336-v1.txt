DODDER (Frisian dodd, a bunch; Dutch dot, ravelled thread), the popular name of the annual, leafless, twining, [9:7:320] epiphytic plants forming the genus Cuscuta and natural order Cuscutaceae or, according to some botanists, the tribe Cuscuteae of the Convolvulaceae. All the species are natives of temperate regions, and all have strong acrid properties. The flowers, which grow in clusters, have a quinque-partite, coloured calyx; scales alternating with the corolline lobes; carpels forming a syncarpous ovary; the albumen of the seeds fleshy; and the embryo spiral, filiform, and acotyledonous. On coming in contact with the living stem of some other plant the seedling dodder throws out a sucker, by which it attaches itself and commences to absorb the sap of its foster-parent; it then soon ceases to have any connection with the ground. As it grows, it throws out fresh suckers, establishing itself firmly on its victim. After making a few turns round one stem the dodder finds its way to another, and thus it continues twining and branching till it resembles “fine, closely-tangled, wet catgut.” The injury done to flax, clover, hop, and bean crops by species of dodder is often very great. C. europaea, the Greater Dodder, is found parasitic on nettles, thistles, vetches, and the hop; C. Epilinum, on flax; G . Epithymum, on furze, ling, and thyme. C. Trifolii, the Clover Dodder, is perhaps a sub-species of the last-mentioned. For a figure of C. verrucosa, the Warty Dodder, see vol. iv. pl. x.
