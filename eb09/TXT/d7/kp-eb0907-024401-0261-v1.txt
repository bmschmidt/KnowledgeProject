DINOTHERIUM, an extinct mammal, fossil remains of which occur in the Miocene beds of France, Germany, Greece, and Northern India. These until lately consisted exclusively of teeth and the bones of the head. An entire skull, obtained from the Epplesheim beds of Hesse Darmstadt in 1836, measured 4∣ feet in length and 3 feet in breadth, and thus indicated an animal exceeding the elephant in size. Its upper jaw was destitute of incisor and canine teeth, but possessed 5 molars on each side, with a corresponding number in the jaw beneath. Its most remarkable feature, however, consisted in the front part of the lower jaw being bent downwards and bearing two tusklike incisors also directed downwards and backwards. Judging from these remains Professor Owen placed the Dinothérium among the proboscidean mammals; De Blain ville, on the other hand, regarded it as an aquatic animal, destitute of legs, and somewhat resembling the manatee,—its reversed tusks having probably been used to moor the creature to the bank of the streams it frequented, or to assist it in leaving the water. The recent discovery, however, of limb bones, decidedly proboscidean in type, and supposed to belong to the Dinothérium, supports the view that these creatures were more akin to the elephant and mastodon than to the manatee.
