DEWBERRY, Rubus caesius, a deciduous trailing planf, allied to the bramble, of the natural order Rosaceae. It is common in woods, hedges, and the borders of fields in England and other countries of Europe. The leaves are trifoliate, hairy beneath, and of a dusky green; the flowers, which appear in June and July, are white, or pale rose-coloured. The fruit is large, and closely embraced by the calyx, and consists of few grains, which are black, with a glaucous bloom; it has an agreeable acid taste, and is used for making a kind of wine.
