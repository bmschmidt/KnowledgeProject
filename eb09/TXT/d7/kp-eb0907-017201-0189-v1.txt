DIBDIN, Thomas (1771-1841), English dramatist and song writer, was one of the sons of the subject of last notice, and was born on the 21st of March 1771. He was apprenticed to a London upholsterer, but after four years’ service he broke his engagement and joined a company of country players. From 1789 to 1795 he performed in every department of the drama, composing daring the same period more than 1000 songs, and making his first attempt as a dramatic writer. He returned to London in 1795, having married two years before; and in the winter of 1798-1799 his Jew and the Doctor was produced at Covent Garden. From this time he contributed a very large number of comedies, operas, farces, &c., to the public entertainment. Some of these brought immense popularity to the writer and immense profits to the theatres. It is stated that the pantomime of Mother Goose produced more than £20,000 at Covent Garden Theatre, and the High-mettled Racer £18,000 at Astley’s. Notwithstanding this run of popularity, aud the author’s connection with theatrical notabilities, his last years were passed in comparative indigence. In 1827 he published two volumes of Reminiscences; and at the time of his death he was preparing an edition of his father’s sea songs, for which a small sum was allowed him weekly by the lords of the Admiralty. He died in London, September 16, 1841.
