DROUET D’ERLON, Jean Baptiste (1765-1844), count, marshal of France, and governor of Algeria, was born at Rheims, July 29, 1765. He entered the army in 1782, was discharged after five years’ service, re-entered it in 1792, and two years later became aide-de-camp to General Lefèvre. He served at the sieges of Valenciennes, Quesri,oy, and Condé, and under Hoche at the blockade of Ehrenbreitstein. As general of brigade (1799) he fought at Zurich, at the bridge of Schaffhausen, and at the taking of Constance. In August 1800 he was promoted general of -division. He distinguished himself at Ulm and Hohenlinden, and by a skilful manoeuvre decided the victory of Jena (1806). Drouet took a brilliant part in the siege of Dantzic, and signed the capitulation of the town; he fought at Mohrungen, and was severely "wounded at Friedland (1807). After this battle he was made grand officer of the Legion of Honour, was created Count d’Erlon, and received a pension. He afterwards served with distinction in the Peninsular War, and defeated General Hill at the Col de Maya. After the first Restoration he was named commander of the 16th military division. He presided at the council of war, at Lille, which acquitted General Excelmans; but in March 1815 he was arrested on suspicion of treason, and suffered a short imprisonment. He was present under Napoleon at Waterloo, and was severely reproached by the emperor for not bringing his division into action. After the second Restoration he quitted France, and did not return till 1825. He was appointed governor of Algeria in 1834, was created marshal of France in 1843, and died at Paris January 25, 1844.
