DEFENDER OF THE FAITH (Fidei Defensor), a peculiar title belonging to the sovereign of England, in the same way that Catholicus belongs to the king of Spain, and Christianissimus to the king of France. Although certain charters have been appealed to in proof of an earlier use of the title, it appears to have been first conferred by Leo. X. on Henry VIII. in 1521 for writing against Luther. It was afterwards confirmed by Clement VII. When Henry suppressed the religious houses at the time of the Reformation, the Pope not only deprived him of this designation, but also deposed him; in the thirty-fifth year of his reign, however, the title of “Defender of the Faith” was confirmed by Parliament, and has continued to be used by all his successors on the English throne.
