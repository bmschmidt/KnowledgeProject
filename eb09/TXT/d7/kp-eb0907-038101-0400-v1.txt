DOVER, a city of the United States, capital of Strafford county, New Hampshire, situated on the Cocheco, a tributary of the Piscataqua, at a railway junction twelve miles north-west of Portsmouth. It has eight churches, a high school, a city hall, and a public library; and the water-power furnished by the falls of the Cocheco encourages its industrial activity, the principal results of which are prints and other cotton goods to the value of upwards of Â£200,000 annually, woollens, leather, boots and shoes, hats, oil-cloth, sand-paper, iron and brass wares, and carriages. The town was founded in 1623, and received its city charter in 1855. Population in 1870, 9294.
