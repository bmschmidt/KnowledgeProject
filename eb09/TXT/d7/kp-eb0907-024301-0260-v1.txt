DINGWALL, a royal burgh of Scotland, the county town of Boss-shire, 15 miles north-west of Inverness, at the junction of the Sutherland and Dingwall and Skye railways. It occupies a low situation at the upper end of Cromarty Firth, where the valley of Strathpeffer unites with the alluvial lands at the mouth of the Conan. Though a neatly built and thriving place, it has nothing special to show except the curious old town-house, a few remains of the ancient mansion-house of the powerful family of Ross, and an obelisk 57 feet in height, erected to the memory of George, first earl of Cromarty. Dingwall, like so many towns on the same coast, is of Norse origin, and its name in Scandinavian signifies the Court Hill. In Gaelic it is known as Inbhir-pheoran, or the mouth of the Peffer. Its charter, granted by Alexander II., was renewed by James IV. It unites with Tain, Dornoch, Wick, Kirkwall, and Cromarty in returning one member to Parliament. Population in 1871, 2125.
