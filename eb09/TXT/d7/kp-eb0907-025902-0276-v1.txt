DISPENSATION is a term used by the canonists to signify an act of jurisdiction by which the rigour of the general law is relaxed in a particular case. Regarded from this point of view a dispensation is considered by the canonists not to be an exception to, but a complement of, the law, and it is granted with discretion in cases where the law would otherwise work injustice. “Fuit dispensatio inventa, ut esset pars distributivae justitiae.” The exercise of this jurisdiction in the earlier days of the Christian church was vested in respect of minor matters in the bishops, and in more important matters in the provincial councils; but by degrees this latter jurisdiction came to be exercised by the patriarchs exclusively, and ultimately, in the case of the Western Church, by the Pope alone, who, at the time of the Reformation of the Anglican Church, had acquired for the Holy See supreme authority in all the more important matters of dispensation. It was one object of the Parliament of England, by the statute “concerning Peter Pence and Dispensations” (25 Henry VIII. c. 21), to divest the Pope of the exercise of any powers of dispensation within the realm of England, by forbidding the king and his subjects to sue to the Pope or to the Holy See for any dispensation. The Parliament further vested the power of granting dispensations, such as had been hitherto obtained from the see of Rome, in the archiépiscopal see of Canterbury—subject, however, to the limitation that they should be only granted for such causes as were not contrary or repugnant to Holy Scripture or to the laws of the realm, and for this purpose the archbishop of Canterbury was empowered to constitute a sufficient commissary, and a clerk who should write and register all such dispensations. The representative of the clerk so appointed by the archbishop is the registrar of the office of faculties, over which the master of the faculties presides, as the archbishop’s commissary. The matters for which dispensations were accustomed to be granted from the office of faculties, in the reign of Henry VIII., have almost all become obsolete, or have been withdrawn from the cognizance of the master of the faculties; and the special authority of his court in the present day consists in the grant of special licences for marriages, which are valid in both the provinces of Canterbury and of York, and the right of granting which has been preserved to the archbishop of Canterbury in all subsequent marriage Acts. These special licences are simply dispensations for the solemnization of marriage at other times and in other places than those to which marriage is restricted by the Anglican canons or by the statute law of the realm.
