DEMETRIUS, a Cynic philosopher, was a disciple of Apollonius of Tyana, to whom he afterwards proved an able antagonist. He spent the greater part of his life at Corinth, and first became famous during the reign of Caligula. The emperor, wishing to gain the philosopher to his interest, sent him a large present; but Demetrius refused it with indignation, and said, “If Caligula wishes to bribe me, let him send me his crown.” Vespasian was [9:7:59] displeased with his insolence, and banished him; but the Cynic derided the punishment, and bitterly inveighed against the emperor. He lived to an advanced age; and Seneca observes that nature had brought him forth to show mankind how an exalted genius may live uncorrupted by the vices of the world.
