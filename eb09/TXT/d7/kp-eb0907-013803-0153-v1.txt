DEVIZES, a municipal and parliamentary borough and market town of England, in North Wilts, situated on the Kennet and Avon canal, 86 miles west of London by rail. It stands on a plateau in the centre of the county, near the northern limit of Salisbury Plain. The town, which is of considerable antiquity, consists of a market-place with streets diverging therefrom. Some of the houses retain their antique timber construction. In the middle of the market-place there stands a large cross erected by Lord Sidmouth in 1815. The principal public buildings are the town hall, the corn exchange (a spacious and handsome building), the county jail, the Bear Club charity school, and the churches. St John’s Church dates from the reign of Henry I., but has received numerous additions and repairs, and was restored in 1863; it belongs to the Norman Perpendicular style of architecture. The building is complete, with nave, transept, chancel, and chantry chapels. St Mary’s is also of ancient origin, but was mostly rebuilt in the 15 th century. Besides these there are chapels belonging to the various nonconformist bodies. Devizes at one time was famous for its woollen manufactures, but these have long been discontinued, and the only articles now manufactured are silk and snuff. Ale is also brewed. There is, however, a large trade in grain carried on; and the Devizes corn-market is one of the most important in the west of England. The town is said to have taken its rise after the erection of the formidable castle which once stood there, but has now entirely disappeared. This fortress was built about the year 1132 by Bishop Roger of Salisbury, in the reign of Henry I. In 1138 it was seized by Stephen in his campaign against the bishops, and three years thereafter was taken and held by Robert Fitz Herbert on behalf of Queen Maud. He did not, however, retain possession of it for any length of time. It was eventually dismantled in 1376. During the wars of the commonwealth Devizes was unsuccessfully besieged by Waller in 1643, but was taken by Fairfax and Cromwell two years later. It received its borough charter from Maud under the name of De Vies; and it is governed by a mayor, 6 aldermen, and 18 councillors. From the time of Edward III. it was represented in Parliament by two members, but the Reform Act of 1868 reduced its representation to one member. The borough, which has an area of 907 acres, is divided into two wards—north and south. Population in 1851, 6554; and in 187∙1, 6839.
