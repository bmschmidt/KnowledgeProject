DEMETRIUS II., king of Macedonia, son of Antigonus Gonnatas, who was a son of Demetrius Poliorcetes. He occupied the throne for ten years, but little is known of him. His reign coincided with the period of the Achaean league, which was then strengthened by an alliance with the Oetolians. Only a fragment of Macedonian power remained in Greece; a few towns in the Peloponnesus were held by Macedonian governors. Demetrius offered a slight opposition to the two patriotic leagues, and wrested Baeotia from the Oetolians. At his death in 232 b.c. Antigonus Doson undertook the government for his son Philip, who was under age.
