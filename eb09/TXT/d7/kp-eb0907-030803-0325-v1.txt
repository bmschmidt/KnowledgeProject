DÖBRENTEI, Gabor (i.e., Gabriel) (1786-1851), an Hungarian philologist and antiquary, was born at Nagyszöllös in 1786. He completed his studies at the universities of Wittenberg and Leipsic, and was afterwards engaged as a tutor in Transylvania. At this period he originated and edited the Erdelyi Muséum, which, notwithstanding its important influence on the development of the Magyar language and literature, soon failed for want of support. In 1820 Döbreutei settled at Pesth, and there he spent the rest of his life. He held various official posts, but continued zealously to pursue the studies for which he had early shown a strong preference His great work is the Ancient Monuments of the Magyar Language (Régi Magyar NyelvemVeketc), the editing of which was intrusted to him by the Hungarian Academy. The first volume was published in 1838 and the fifth was in course of preparation at the time of his death. Döbrentei was one of the twenty-two scholars appointed in 1825 to plan and organize, under the presidency of Count Teleki, the Hungarian Academy. In addition to his great work he wrote many valuable papers on historical and philological subjects, and many biographical notices of eminent Hungarians. These appeared in the Hungarian translation of Brockhaus’s Conversations-Lexikon. He translated into Hungarian Macbeth and other plays of Shakespeare, several of Schiller’s tragedies, and Molière’s Avare, and wrote several original poemsi His article on “Magyar Literature” in the Conversations-Laexihon was translated into English. Döbrentei does not appear to have taken any part in the revolutionary movement of 1848. He died at his country house, near Pesth, March 28, 1851.
