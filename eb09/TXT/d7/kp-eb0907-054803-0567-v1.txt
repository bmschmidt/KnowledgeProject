DUPIN, Louis Ellies (1657-1719), a celebrated French ecclesiastical historian, belonged to a noble family in Normandy, and was born at Paris on the 17th June 1657. He received his early education from his father, and had scarcely reached his tenth year when he entered the college of Harcourt, where he graduated as M.A. in 1672. Detennining to adopt the ecclesiastical profession, he became a pupil of the Sorbonne, and received the degre of B.D. in 1680, and that of D.D. in 1684. About this time he conceived the idea of a Bibliotheque Universelle de tous les [9:7:549] Auteurs Ecclesiastiques, the first volume of which appeared in 1686. The liberty with which he there treated the doctrines of the fathers aroused ecclesiastical prejudice, and the archbishop of Paris condemned the work. Dupin consented to a retractation, but it was suppressed in 1693; he was, however, allowed again to continue it on changing its title, to the extent of substituting Houvelleior Universelle. He was subsequently exiled to Châtellerault as a Jansenist, but the sentence of banishment was repealed on a new retractation. In 1718 he entered into a correspondence with Wake, archbishop of Canterbury, with a view to a union of the English and Gallican churches; and, being suspected of projecting a change in the dogmas of the church, his papers were seized in 1719, but nothing was found that could be properly framed into an accusation against him. The same zeal for union is said to have induced Yim, during the residence of Peter the Great in France, and Lt that monarch’s request, to draw up a plan for uniting the Greek and Roman churches. He died at Paris on the Gth June 1719.

Dupin was a voluminous author. Besides his great work on L·cclesiastical authors, mention may be made of Bibliothèque Universelle des Historiens, 2 vols. (1707); L’Histoire de l' Église en abrégé (1712); and L’Histoire Profane depuis le commencement du Monde jusqu’ à present, 4 vols. 1712.
