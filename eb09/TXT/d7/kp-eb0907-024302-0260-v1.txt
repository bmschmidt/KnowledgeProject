DINKELSBÜHL, a town of Bavaria, in the department of Mittelfranken, or Middle Franconia, on the Wörnitz, about 40 miles by rail from Donauwörth, where the river joins the Danube. It is an important centre both of civil aud ecclesiastical administration, and has a Boman catholic and a Protestant church, a Latin and industrial school, and several benevolent institutions. The inhabitants carry on the manufacture of gloves, stockings, and other articles, and deal largely in cattle. Fortified by Henry I,, Dinkelsbühl received in 1305 the same municipal rights as Ulm, and obtained in 1351 the position of a free imperial city, which it retained till 1803. Its municipal code, the Dinkelsbühler Recht, printed in 1536, and republished in a revised form in 1738, contained a very extensive collection of laws on matters both of public and private interest. Population in 1875, 5238.
