DIANO, or Teggiano, a town of Italy in the province of Principato Citeriore, 45 miles south-east of Salerno, on an isolated eminence, above the upper part of the valley of the Negro, or Tanager, to which it gives the name of Val di Diano. It represents the ancient Tegianum, a municipal town of Lucania, of which the ruins ^can still be traced at the foot of the hill; and it possesses a castle, several churches of some interest, and three conventual buildings. In 1497 it was strong enough to resist, under Antonio Sanseverino of Salerno, the siege undertaken by Frederick of Aragon. Population in 1871, 6224.
