DINAPUR, a town and military station of British India, is situated on the right or south bank of the Ganges, and on the East Indian Railway, in the district of Patna, province of Behar, about ten miles west of Patna. The town, which stretches along the river bank for about a mile, consists mostly of thatched cottages, one story high, and is not laid out with regard to order or symmetry. Several handsome villas, however, surround the place—the residences of the European officers and the richer natives. Barracks sufficiently large to accommodate 1200 men are situated in Dinapur. In 1857 the sepoy garrison oí the place took part in the mutiny of that year, but after a conflict with the European troops were forced to retire from the town. Population about 18,000.
