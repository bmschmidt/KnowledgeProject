DOCTRINAIRES, the name applied by its opponents to a small but very influential political party in France which made itself prominent after the restoration of the Bourbons in 1815. The doctrine or fundamental principle on which its action was based was that the sole justification of any form of government was the manner in which it exercised its power. Rejecting the claim of divine right, whether urged for monarchy or for republicanism, the doctrinaires were opposed alike to the ultra-royalists and to the revolutionists. In the chamber they occupied the left centre, and thus marked themselves out from the centre or ministerialist and the left or opposition party.

While maintaining the re-established dynasty their efforts were mainly directed towards moulding the constitution into a shape resembling as nearly as possible that of England. The leaders of the doctrinaires were Royer-Coslard, the Due de Broglie, and Guizot. After the revolution of 1830 several of them came into powe√Ø and proved strong supporters of constitutional monarchy on the model that has existed in England since the reign of William. The name doctrinaires fell entirely out of use after 1848, but the principles of the party have been faithfully represented since that date by the Orleanists. See France.
