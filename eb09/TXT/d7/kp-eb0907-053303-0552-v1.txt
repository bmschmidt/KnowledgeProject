DUNCAN, Thomas (1807-1845), a distinguished Scottish portrait and historical painter, was born at Kinclaven, in Perthshire, May 24,1807. He was educated at the Perth Academy, and afterwards began the study of the law, which, however, he speedily abandoned for the more congenial pursuit of art. Commencing his new career under the instruction of Sir William Allan, he early attained distinction as a delineator of the human figure; and his first pictures established nis fame so completely, that at a very early age he was appointed professor of colouring, and afterwards of drawing, in the Trusteesâ€™ Academy of Edinburgh. In 1840 he produced one of his finest pieces, Prince Charles Edward and the Highlanders entering Edinburgh[9:7:534] after the Rattle of Prestonpans. This painting secured his election as an associate of the Royal Academy in 1843. In that same year he produced his no less famous picture of Charles Edward asleep after Culloden, protected by Flora Macdonald, which, like many other of his pieces, has been often engraved. In 1844 appeared his Cupid and his Martyrdom of John Brown of Priesthill, the last effort of his pencil, with the exception of a portrait of himself, now in the National Gallery in Edinburgh. He particularly excelled in his portraits of ladies and children. He died at Edinburgh, May 25, 1845.
