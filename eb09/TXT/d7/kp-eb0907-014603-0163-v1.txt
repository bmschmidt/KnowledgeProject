DHAR, a small native state of Malwá, in Central India, under the political superintendence of the British Government. Area, 2500 square miles; population, 150,000 souls. The state contains much fertile ground, the principal agricultural products being wheat, opium, gram, sugarcane, Indian corn, and cotton. The Rájá is a Puar or Pramar Rájput, who claims descent from the famous King Vikramáditya; but the family only received possession of Dhar in 1749, by gift from the Marhattá Peshwá, Báji Ráo. Towards the close of the last, and in the early part of the present century, the state was subject to a series of spoliations by Sindhia and Holkar, and was only preserved from destruction by the talents and courage of the adoptive mother of the fifth Rájá. By a treaty in 1819, Dhar passed under British protection, and bound itself to act in subordinate co-operation. The state was confiscated for rebellion in 1857, but subsequently restored to Rájá Anand Ráo Puar, then a minor, with the exception of the detached district of Bairusia, which was granted to the Begam of Bhopál. The revenue of the state is estimated at £80,000 per annum, inclusive of jagirs. The military force consists of 276 cavalry, with 800 infantry (including police), 2 guns, and 21 artillery. Road-making is being pushed on. Fifteen schools were attended in 1874 by 550 scholars. Two charitable dispensaries afford gratuitous medical relief. The town of Dhar, situated on the road from Mau (Mhow) to Baroda, extends 3¾ miles in length by half a mile in breadth, and is surrounded by a mud wall. The fort, built of red stone, forms a conspicuous object outside the city, and contains the Rájá’s palace.
