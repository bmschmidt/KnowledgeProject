THEOPHYLACT, a well-known Biblical commentator, was born most probably at Euripus, in Euboea, about the middle of the 11th century. He became a deacon at Constantinople, and attained a high reputation as a scholar, as is shown by the fact that he became the tutor of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, son of Michael VII., for whom he wrote his ∏αιδ∈ια βaσιλικη. About 1078 he went into Bulgaria as archbishop of Achris. In his letter he complains much of the rude manners of the Bulgarians, and he sought to be relieved of his office, but apparently without success. His death took place after 1107.

His commentaries on the Gospels, Acts, the Pauline epistles, and the Minor Prophets are founded on those of Chrysostom, but deserve the considerable place they hold in exegetical literature for their appositeness, sobriety, accuracy, and judiciousness. His other extant works include seventy-five letters and various homilies and orations and other minor pieces. A splendid edition of the whole in Greek and Latin, with a preliminary dissertation, was published in 1754-63 by J. F. B. Μ. de Rossi (4 vols, fol., Venice).
