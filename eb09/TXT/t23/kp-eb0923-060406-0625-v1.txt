TUKE, Samuel (1784-1857), English philanthropist, son of Henry Tuke, born at York in 1784, greatly advanced the cause of the amelioration of the condition of the insane, and devoted himself largely to the York Retreat, the methods of treatment pursued in which he made more widely known by his Description of the Retreat near York, & c. (York, 1813). His writings on the construction of asylums and on other subjects connected with the insane are well known. He died in 1857.
