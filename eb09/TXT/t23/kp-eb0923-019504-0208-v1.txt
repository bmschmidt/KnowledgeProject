TERSTEEGEN, Gerhard (1697-1769), German religious writer, was born at Mörs in Rhenish Prussia on 25th November 1697. After being educated at the gymnasium of his native town, he pursued for some years the calling of a ribbon-maker. In 1728 he withdrew from all secular pursuits and gave himself entirely to religious work. His writings include a collection of hymns (Blumengärtlein, 1729; last edition, Stuttgart, 1868), a volume of Gebete, and another of Briefe. He died at Mühlheim in Rhenish Prussia on 3d April 1769.
