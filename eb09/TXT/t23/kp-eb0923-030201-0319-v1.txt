THIELT, a town of Belgium, in the province of West Flanders, 15 miles south-south-east of Bruges, on a branch line between Ingelmunster and Deynze. It manufactures linen and woollen goods, gloves, vinegar and spirits, and has tanneries and bleacheries. There is also some trade in cattle and grain. The town was of considerable importance in the Middle Ages, but was almost entirely destroyed by fire in 1383, a calamity from which it never wholly recovered. The population in 1876 was 10,527.
