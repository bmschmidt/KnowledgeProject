TERMINI, or Termini Imerese (Therrnae Himerenses), a town on the north coast of Sicily, at the mouth of a river of the same name, in the province of Palermo, and [9:23:189] 23 miles east-south-east of that town. None of its modern buildings are of any special interest; in the Piano de San Giovanni above the town the substructure of a Roman villa has been excavated, and there are also traces of an amphitheatre. Termini is one of the busiest provincial towns of Sicily; the surrounding district being exceedingly fertile and the harbour good, there is a considerable export trade in grain, fruit, tartar, and other products. The macaroni of Termini is in high repute. The tunny and sardine fisheries are extensive, and there is a school of navigation. The warm saline springs (110Â° Fahr.), sung by Pindar, are still largely resorted to, there being a well-appointed bath establishment, founded by Ferdinand I. The population of the town in 1881 was 22,370, with its suburbs 22,733 (commune, 23,148).

For the ancient history of Termini see Himera. The castle of Termini, which Robert of Naples besieged in vain in 1338, was destroyed in 1860.
