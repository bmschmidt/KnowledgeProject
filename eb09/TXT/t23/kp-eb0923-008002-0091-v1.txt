TATE, Nahum (1652-1715), poet-laureate, -was born in 1652 in Dublin, and was educated at Trinity College there. He afterwards removed to London, and adopted literature as a profession, succeeding Shadwell as poetlaureate in 1692. He died within the precincts of the Mint, Southwark (whither he had taken refuge from his debtors), August 12, 1715.

His name is still remembered in connexion with the New Version of the Psalms of David, which, in conjunction with Nicholas Brady (g â€™.v.), he published in 1696 (see Hymns, vol. xii. p. 590). Tate was also the author of some ten dramatic pieces (see Biogr. Drarnaiica, i. 703) and a great number of poems, including one entitled The Innocent Epicure, or The Art of Angling (1697).
