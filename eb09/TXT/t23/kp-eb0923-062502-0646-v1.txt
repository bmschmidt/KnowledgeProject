TUNSTALL, a market town of Staffordshire, England, is situated on a branch line of the London and NorthWestern Railway and on the Trent and Mersey Canal, 4 miles north-west of Stoke and 168 north-west of London. Among the public buildings are the market (1858), town hall (1884), old court-house (now used as a free library and reading room), and board schools (1880). The chief manufactures are those peculiar to the Potteries district; there are also large iron-works (coal and iron being obtained in the neighbourhood), and brick and tile works. The town is chiefly the growth of the 19th century, and in 1811 numbered only 1677 inhabitants. In 1885 it was included for parliamentary purposes in the borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme. It is governed by a local board of twenty-four members. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 690 acres) was 13,540 in 1871, and 14,244 in 1881.
