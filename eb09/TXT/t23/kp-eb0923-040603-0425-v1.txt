TIPTON, a town of England, in Staffordshire, is situated in the valley of the Stour, on the London and NorthWestern Railway, 4âˆ£ miles south-east of Wolverhampton and 121 north-west of London. It is built in a somewhat scattered and irregular manner, with coal-pits and iron and other works interspersed. Branches of the Birmingham Canal supply it with water communication. It depends chiefly on its iron manufactures, especially of a heavy kind, and has numerous large furnaces and rollingmills. Its principal goods are rails, engine-boilers, tubes, fenders, and fire-irons. It also possesses works for making iron bridges and stations, cement-works, brick-works, and maltings. There are no public buildings of importance. Tipton has six churches. The parish church is of very ancient date, and its registers go back to the year 1513. Formerly the town was sometimes called Tibbington. It is under the government of a local board formed in 1866. The population of the urban sanitary district [9:23:407] (area, 2697 acres) in 1871 was 29,445, and in 1881 it was 30,013.
