TENASSERIM, a division of the province of British Burmah, lying between 9° 30' and 19° 30' N. lat. and 95° 50' and 99° 30' E. long. It has an area of 46,730 square miles and comprises the seven districts of Moulmein town, Amherst, Tavoy, Mergui, Shwagyin, Toungoo, and Salwin, which formed the tract south of Pegu conquered from Burmah in 1826, and were for many years generally known as the Tenasserim provinces. The southern extremity of the division approaches the insular region of Malaysia, and it is fringed along its entire western coast by a number of islands, forming in the north the Moscos and in the south the Mergui Archipelago. The eastern frontier is formed by a mountain range 5000 feet high, which acts as a water-parting between the Tenasserim and the Siamese river systems.

The population of the division in 1881 was 825,741 (437,900 males and 387,841 females). By religion Hindus numbered 23,145, Mohammedans 24,786, Christians 28,315, Buddhists 698,304, and Nat worshippers 51,160. The cultived area in 1885-86 was returned at 729,251 acres. The gross revenue in the same year was £184,162, of which the land-tax yielded £107,631.
