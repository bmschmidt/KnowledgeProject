TERAMO, a town of Italy, capital of the province of Teramo (formerly Abruzzo Ulteriore I.) and an episcopal see, stands on the left bank of the Tordino where it is joined by the Vezzola, 12 miles from the coast and 876 feet above sea-level. It is connected by a branch line with Giulianova on the railway from Ancona to Brindisi. The picturesque valley of the Tordino is here dominated by the peaks of the Gran Sasso dâ€™Italia (9522 feet). The town is traversed by one straight wide street with large houses, but for the most part it consists of narrow dirty lanes; the modern suburbs are good. The cathedral (1317-55) has been greatly modernized; the church of San Agostino is in the later Gothic style. The antiquities include remains of a gateway, a theatre, and baths, as w ell as numerous inscriptions. There are manufactures of wool and silk, and of straw hats and pottery. The population of the town in 1881 was 8634, with its suburbs 13,988 (commune, 20,309).

Teramo is the ancient Interamna Praetutiana, capital of the Praetutii. In the Middle Ages it was known as Aprutium (whence Abruzzo); the intermediate form of the present name was Teramne.
