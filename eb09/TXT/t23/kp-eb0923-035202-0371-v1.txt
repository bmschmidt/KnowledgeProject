TICONDEROGA, a village and township of the United States, in Essex county, New York, situated upon the stream connecting Lakes George and Champlain, and extending back upon an abrupt promontory which separates the two lakes. Two railroads enter the village,â€”the Delaware and Hudson and a branch of the Central Vermont. The population in 1880 was 3304.

Commanding the direct route from the St Lawrence to the Hudson, Ticonderoga was early seized by the French and fortified under the name of Fort Carillon. In July 1758 it was unsuccessfully attacked by Abercrombie. In the same month of the succeeding year it was abandoned by the French upon the approach of an English army under Amherst, who occupied it and greatly strengthened its works. At the beginning of the Revolution, in 1775, the fort was surprised and captured by Ethan Allen and a party of Vermont militia. In 1778 it was retaken by the English under Burgoyne and was held by them until the close of the war.
