TOKAY, or Tokaj, a small town in the county of Zemplén, in the north-east of Hungary, at the influx of the Bodrog into the Tisza, in 48° 7' N. lat., 21° 4' E. long. The slopes of the adjacent mountains of Hegyallya, which are of volcanic origin, produce excellent wine, several kinds of which are of perhaps the best, sweetest, and strongest quality in the world. Of these, however, none or hardly any come into the market, the wine usually sold under the name of Tokay not being a natural wine, and often not coming from the district at all. Tokay, along with about twenty-five neighbouring villages, produces annually an average of 2,200,000 gallons. The vine culture has been greatly improved of late years by a company in Budapest. The timber trade, fishing, and export of fruits are also considerable. The population was 4479 in 1880.
