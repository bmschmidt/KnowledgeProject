TERRANOVA, or Terranuova, a seaport town of Sicily, on a hill at the mouth of the Terranova, in the province of Caltanisetta, and 41J miles east-south-east from Girgenti. It contains a castle and several large churches r but has little to interest the traveller. Though the harbour is poor, there is a considerable trade in corn, wine, fruit, sulphur, and soda. Cloth is manufactured to a small extent. The population of the town in 1881 was 16,440, that of the commune 17,173. In and near Terranova are the remains of the ancient Gela (q.v.}. The modern town owes its origin to the emperor Frederick II.
