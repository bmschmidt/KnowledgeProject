TRINITY HOUSE, Corporation of. An association of English mariners, which originally had its head-quarters at Deptford in Kent. In its first charter, received from Henry VIII. in 1514, it was described as the “guild or fraternity of the most glorious and undividable Trinity of St Clement,” the court being made to consist of master, wardens, and assistants, numbering thirteen in all and elected annually by the brethren. Deptford having been made a royal dockyard by Henry VIII., and being the station where outgoing ships were supplied with pilots, the corporation rapidly developed its influence and usefulness. By Henry VIII. it was entrusted with the direction of the new naval dockyard. From Elizabeth, who conferred on it a grant of arms in 1573, it received authority to erect beacons and other marks for the guidance of navigators along the coasts of England. It was also recognized as the authority in the construction of vessels for the royal navy. In 1604 a select class was constituted called elder brethren, the other members being called younger brethren. By the charter of 1609 the sole management of affairs was conferred on the elder brethren, the younger brethren, however, having a vote in the election of master and wardens. The practical duties of the fraternity are discharged by the acting elder brethren, who have all had experience in naval affairs; but as a mark of honour persons of rank and eminence are admitted as elder brethren and now form a large proportion of the members. In 1647 the corporation was dissolved by parliament, but it was reconstructed in 1660, and the charter was renewed by James II. in 1685. A new hall and almshouses were erected at Deptford in 1765; but for some time the offices of the corporation had been transferred to London, and in 1798 their headquarters were removed to Trinity House, Tower Hill, built from the designs of Wyatt. By an Act of 1836 they received powers to purchase from the crown, as well as from private proprietors, all interests in coast lights. For the maintenance of lights, buoys, &c., they had power to raise money by tolls, the surplus being devoted to the relief of old and indigent mariners or their near relatives. In 1853 the control of the funds collected by the corporation was transferred to the Board of Trade, and the money over which the brethren were allowed independent control was ultimately reduced to the private income derived from funded and trust property. Their practical duties in the erection of lighthouses, buoys, and beacons remain as important as ever, the number of persons employed in their service being over 800. They also examine navigating lieutenants in the royal navy, and act as nautical advisers in the High Court of Admiralty.
