TURNER, Charles (1773-1857), an English engraver, was born at Woodstock in 1773. He entered the schools of the Royal Academy in 1795; and, engraving in stipple in the manner of Bartolozzi, he was employed by Alderman Boydell. His finest plates, however, are in mezzotint, a method in which he engraved J. M. W. Turner’s Wreck and twenty-four subjects of his Liber Studiorum, Reynolds’s Marlborough Family, and many of Raeburn’s best portraits, including those of Sir Walter Scott, Lord Newton, Dr Hamilton, Profs. Dugald Stewart and John Robison, and Dr Adam. He also worked after Lawrence, Shee, and Owen. He was an admirable engraver, large, broad, and masterly in touch; and he reproduced with great fidelity the characteristics of the various painters whose works he translated into black and white. In 1828 he was elected an associate engraver of the Royal Academy. He died in London on 1st August 1857.
