TITANS, powerful beings of Greek mythology, the children of Sky and Earth. According to Hesiod, the male Titans were Oceanus, Caeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Cronus; the female were Thea, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, and Tethys, to whom Apollodorus adds Dione. For the rebellion of the Titans against their father Sky (Uranus), the success and reign of Cronus, and the final consignment of the Titans to Tartarus by Zeus, see Mythology, vol. xvii. p. 155, and Saturn, vol. xxi. p. 320 sq.
