TERLIZZI, a town of Italy, in the province of Bari, and 20 miles west from that town, stands in the midst of a fertile plain. It has a castle which at one time was very strong and occasionally resorted to by the emperor Frederick II. and afterwards by the Aragonese sovereigns. The walls and towers of the town still remain, but the fosse has been turned into boulevards. Terlizzi has a considerable trade, chiefly in the wine and fruit of the district. The population of the town in 1881 was 20,442 (commune, 20,592).
