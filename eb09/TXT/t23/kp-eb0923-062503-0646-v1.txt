TURANIAN. This word means etymologically no more than “not Iranian,” and in this sense the word Turan was used by Sasanian monarchs to cover those parts of their realm that did not belong to Iran. The application of the word to denote the Ural-Altaic family of languages is extremely unfortunate and seems to be falling out of use. See Philology, vol. xviii. p. 779.
