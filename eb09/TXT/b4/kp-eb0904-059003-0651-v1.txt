BUTRINTO, a fortified town of European Turkey on the coast of Albania, in the sandjak of Del vino, directly opposite the island of Corfu, and situated at the mouth of a stream which connects the Lake of Vatzindro with the bay. It has a small harbour, and is the seat of a Greek bishop. In the neighbourhood are the ruins of the ancient Bτιthrotum, consisting of a Roman wall, about a mile in circumference, and some remains of both later and Hellenic work. Buthrotum was a Roman colony in the time of Strabo, but makes little figure in ancient history. The modern city belonged to the Venetians till 1797, when it was seized by the French, who in 1799 had to yield to the Russians and Turks. Population, 1500.
