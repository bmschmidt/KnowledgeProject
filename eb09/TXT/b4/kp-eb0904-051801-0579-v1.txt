BULLA (literally a bubble) was the term used by the Romans for any boss or stud, such as those on doors, sword-belts, shields, <fcc. It was applied, however, more particularly to an ornament, generally of gold, worn suspended from the neck by children of noble birth until they assumed the toga virilis, when it was hung up and dedicated to the household gods. See Costume. In ecclesiastical and mediaeval Latin, bulla denotes the metal seal of oval or circular form, bearing the name and generally the image of its owner, which was attached to official documents. The bulla of the empire was of gold, while the Papal bulla was of lead. See Bulls and Briefs.
