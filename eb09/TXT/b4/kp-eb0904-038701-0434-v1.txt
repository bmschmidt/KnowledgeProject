BROWN, Thomas, of facetious memory, as Addison designates him, was the son of a farmer at Shiffnal in Shropshire, and was born in 1663. He was entered at Christ Church College, Oxford, whence he was soon obliged to abscond on account of the irregularities of his life. He was for some time schoolmaster at Kingston-on-Thames, and afterwards went to London, where he had recourse to the usual refuge of half-starved witsâ€”scribbling for bread. He published a great variety of poems, letters, dialogues, &c., full of humour and erudition, but coarse and indelicate. Though a good-natured man, he had the unhappy quality of preferring rather to lose his friend than his joke. He died in 1704, and was interred in the cloister of Westminster Abbey. An incomplete edition of his works was published in 1707, in 4 vols. 12mo.
