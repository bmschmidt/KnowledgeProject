BRIXHAM, a seaport town of England, in the county of Devon, about 200 miles from London, with a station about two miles distant on the South Devon Railway. The town is irregularly built on the cliffs to the south of Torbay, and its harbour is defended by a modern breakwater. It carries on a very extensive fishing and coasting trade, and is a place of resort for sea-bathing. In the early part of the present century it was the seat of a considerable military establishment, with fortified barracks at Bury Head, and it is celebrated in history as the spot where King William landed in 1688. Population of the parish in 1871, 6542.
