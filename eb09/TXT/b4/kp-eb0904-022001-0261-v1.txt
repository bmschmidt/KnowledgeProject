It is the seat of the Roman Catholic bishop of Ermeland, and possesses numerous Roman Catholic institutions. Of these the most important are the Lyceum Hosianum, founded in 1564 by the Cardinal Bishop Hosius, and in 1818 raised to the rank of a faculty of theology, and the deaf and dumb asylum which was established in 1811. There is also a school for the education of schoolmasters. Brewing, tanning, and weaving are the most important industries of the town, which also carries on a certain amount of trade in corn, ship timber, and yarn. The river is navigable for small vessels.
