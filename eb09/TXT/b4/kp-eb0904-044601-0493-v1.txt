BUGULMA, a town of European Russia, in the government of Samara, 243 miles from the city of that name, on the small river Bugulminka, a sub-tributary of the Volga, in 54° 32' N. lat. and 52° 47' E. long. The town rose into existence about 1741-5, and was peopled by soldiers, exiles, and peasants. .During the Pugacheff insurrection it was vainly besieged by the rebels. In 1781 it was made a town of the Ufa government; in 1806 it was transferred to Orenburg, and in 1851 to Samara. Its principal importance is derived from its situation at the junction of two great roads from Ufa and Orenburg, by which it maintains an extensive transit trade. A great annual fair is held from 14th to 21st of September (o. s.). Population in 1867, 5455.
