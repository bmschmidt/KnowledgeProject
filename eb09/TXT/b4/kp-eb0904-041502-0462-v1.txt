BÜCKEBURG, the capital of the principality of Schaumburg-Lippe, is situated at the foot of the Harrl-berg on the River Aue, about 6 miles from Minden, on the Minden and Hanover Railway. It has a castle surrounded by a park, a gymnasium, a normal seminary, a library, an orphanage, a synagogue, and three churches, one of which has the appropriate inscription, Religionis non structura} exemplum. The first houses of Bückeburg began to gather round the castle about 1365; and it was not till the 17th century that the town was surrounded with walls. Population in 1871, 4686.
