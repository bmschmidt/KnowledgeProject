BORROMINI, Francesco, an Italian architect, born at Bissone in 1599. He was much employed in the middle of the 17th century at Rome. In his style he affected originality and richness, which corrupted the noble simplicity of the older schools, though his compositions are occasionally imposing. His principal works are the church of St Agnese in Piazza Navona, the church of La Sapienza in Rome, the church of San Carlino alle Fontane, the church of the Collegio di Propaganda, and the restoration of San Giovanni in Laterano. He died by his own hand at Rome in 1667. Engravings of his chief compositions are to be found in the posthumous work Francisci Borromini opus Architectonicum, 1727.
