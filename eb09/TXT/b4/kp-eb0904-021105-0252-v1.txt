BRAKE, a town in the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, on the left bank of the Weser, about half-way between Bremen and the mouth of the river. It was for centuries the port of Bremen: and though, since the founding of Bremerhaven, it no longer possesses a monopoly of the river traffic as before, it still continues to flourish. Large docks have been recently constructed, and a railway has been opened from the town to Bremen. Shipbuilding and the weaving of woollen cloths are carried on to some extent. Population in 1871, 3800.
