BULGARIN, Thaddäus (1789-1859), a distinguished Russian writer, was born in Lithuania. His father was an officer under Kosciusko in the last disastrous Polish campaign. By some influence of friends Thaddäus was entered at the college for military cadets at St Petersburg, and afterwards received a commission in the Russian army, with which he served against Napoleon and in Finland. He then left the Russian army, joined the Poles under Napoleon, and took part in nearly all the great campaigns in Spain, Germany, and Russia. After the fall of the emperor he took up his residence in Warsaw, and devoted himself to literature, writing in his native Polish language. In 1819 he removed to St Petersburg, learned Russian, and became Russian in every way. He edited, alone or in conjunction with Gretch, the Northern Archives, the Northern Bee, and the Russian Thalia. In 1829 his first novel, Ivan Vuizhagen, gained great popularity. A continuation was afterwards published under the title Peter Ivanovitch Vuizhagen. His other works comprise two novels, Demetrius and Mazeppa, an Account of Russia (Russia in an historical, statistical, geographical, and literary point of view), and his Reminiscences. An English translation of his best novel, Ivan Vuizhagen, was published in 1831.
