BURNTISLAND, a parliamentary burgh and seaport of Scotland, in the county of Fife. It possesses a good pier, a dry dock, and a commodious harbour. Distilling and the herring-fishery are carried on, and a good deal of coal and pig-iron is exported. It is the northern station of the ferry across the Firth of Forth in connection with the North British Railway from Granton, from which it is about five miles distant. The burgh unites with Kirkcaldy, Kinghorn, and Dysart in sending one member to Parliament. The population in 1871 was 3422.
