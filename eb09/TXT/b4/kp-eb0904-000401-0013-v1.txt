BOLBEC, a town of France, capital of a canton in the department of Lower Seine, 18 miles E.N.E. from Havre on the railway to Paris, which here passes over high embankments and a viaduct. It was burned almost to the ground in 1765, but is now a flourishing brick-built manufacturing town, well supplied with water-power by the Bolbec stream. The principal manufactures are cotton goods, woollen cloth, and leather; there are also linen factories and dye-works. Population in 1872, 9019.
