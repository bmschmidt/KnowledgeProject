BRODY, a town of Austria, in the circle of Zloczow, in Galicia, near the Russian frontier. It contains three large synagogues, a Jewish hospital, and a Jewish college, and from its prevailing Jewish character has been called the German Jerusalem. There are also one Roman Catholic and three Greek churches and an industrial school. Its castle is the residence of the Counts Potocki. It is the seat of an extensive trade carried on with Russia and Turkey, and has two large annual fairs, the principal articles of sale being wool, cotton, silk, and peltry. In 1869 the population, of which about two-thirds are Jews, amounted to 18,890. Brody was founded in 1679 under the name of Lubicz, and was raised to the rank of a '.free commercial city in 1779.
