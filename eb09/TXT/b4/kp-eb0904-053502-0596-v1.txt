BURGOYNE, Sir John Fox, son of the preceding, was born in 1782, and died October 7, 1871. He was educated at Eton and Woolwich, obtained a commission, and served in 1800 in Abercromby’s expedition to the Mediterranean. He afterwards served in the Peninsular campaigns, but before the end of them was sent with Pakenham’s division to New Orleans. During the years of peace Burgoyne took an active part in promoting the movement for national defences, and in 1845 was appointed InspectorGeneral of Fortifications. He was engaged at ‘Alma, Balaklava, and Inkerman, and conducted the siege of Sebastopol till his recall in March 1855. After the conclusion of peace he received a baronetcy, and was made general, and in 1868 was raised to the rank of field-marshal.
