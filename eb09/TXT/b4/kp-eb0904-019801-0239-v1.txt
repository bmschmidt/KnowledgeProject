BRADFORD, John, was born at Manchester in the early part of the reign of Henry VIII. Being a good penman and accountant, he became secretary to Sir John Harrington, who was paymaster of the English forces in France. Bradford at this time was gay and thoughtless, and to support his extravagance he appropriated some of the money entrusted to him; but being unable to bear the load of his guilt, he made restitution, and relinquished his employment. About 1547 he took chambers in the Inner Temple, and began to study law; but finding divinity more congenial to his taste, he removed, in the following year, to Catherine Hall, Cambridge, where he studied with such assiduity that in little more than a year he was admitted to the degree of master of arts, and was soon after made fellow of Pembroke Hall. Bishop Ridley, who in 1550 was translated to the see of London, sent for him to the metropolis and appointed him his chaplain. In 1553 he was also made chaplain to Edward VI., and became one of the most popular preachers in the kingdom. Soon after the accession of Mary he was arrested on a charge of sedition and confined in the Tower, where he continued a year and a half. During this time he wrote several epistles which were dispersed in various parts of the kingdom. He was afterwards removed to Southwark, and was at last brought to trial before the court in which Gardiner sat as chief, where he defended his principles to the last, in defiance of all attempts to effect his conversion. He was condemned to the flames, and suffered in Smithfield, July 1, 1555. His writings, which consist chiefly of sermons, meditations, tracts, letters, and prayers, have been published in 12mo by the Religious Tract Society.
