BÜLOW, Friedrich Wilhelm (1755-1816), a Prussian general, was born at Falkenberg on the 16th February 1755. He entered the army at the age of fourteen, rose slowly, and in 1797 was placed at the head of a battalion. He took part in the campaigns of 1806-7, and in 1809 was made major-general and brigadier of infantry. On the renewal of the war against France in 1813 he took the field with the rank of lieutenant-general, was engaged in the battle of Mockern, and stormed the defences of Halle. He was victorious over Oudinot at Luckau and Grossbeeren, and over Ney at Dennewitz. He led the attack on the fortifications at Leipsic, and was conspicuous in the Prussian victory at Laon. To him also belonged the honour of closing the campaign by the capture of Montmartre. For his valuable services he was raised to the rank of general, and made Baron Dennewitz, with a handsome revenue. During the Hundred Days he commanded the fourth army corps, and by his rapid march contributed to Blücher's success at Waterloo. After the conclusion of the war he retired to Königsberg, where he died on the 25th February 1816.
