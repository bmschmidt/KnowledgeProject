BOURBON-Lâ€™ARCHAMBAULT (the Aqua Bormonis of the Itineraries), a town of France, in the department of the Allier, on the Burge, 19 miles W. of Moulins. It was anciently the capital of the Bourbonnais, and gave its name to the great Bourbon family. Its mineral waters, both hot and cold, were formerly in high repute. In 1789 it changed its name for that of Burges-les-Bains, but the former designation was afterwards resumed. It contains a Gothic church of the 12th century, and the outer walls and towers of a castle finished by Anne of Beaujeu in the 15th. Population in 1872, 2400.
