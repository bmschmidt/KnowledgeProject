BRAY, Sir Reginald, architect, was the second son of Sir Richard Bray, one of the privy council of Henry VI. Having been instrumental in the advancement of Henry VII. to the throne of England, he was greatly in favour with that prince, who bestowed upon him honours and wealth. His taste and skill in architecture are attested by those two exquisite structures, Henry VII. ’ s chapel at Westminster and St George’s chapel at Windsor. Ho directed the building of the former, and the finishing and decoration of the latter, to which, moreover, he was a liberal contributor. He died in 1503, and was interred in St George’s chapel.
