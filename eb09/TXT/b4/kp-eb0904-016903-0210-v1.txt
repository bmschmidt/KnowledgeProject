BOUFARIK (the “Hanging Well ”), a town of Algeria, in the province of Algiers and arrondissement of Blidah, about 21 miles from the city of Algiers near the railway thence to Blidah. It is a thoroughly French town, and only dates from 1835, when General Drouet d’Erlon established an entrenched camp on what was then a mere hillock in the midst of an almost uninhabitable marsh. Shortly after Marshal Clausel determined to build a regular citv, which was at first called Medina Clausel in his honour. The draining of the site and neighbourhood was a costly undertaking, and was only accomplished by the sacrifice of many lives. The town is now one of the most flourishing in the country, is surrounded by vast orchards and farms, and affords a market to the pastoral Arabs of the Metidja. There are flax-dressing and spinning mills, and the manufacture of essences and perfumes is carried on to a considerable extent. The population, which is composed of very various elements, amounted in 1872 to 2588.
