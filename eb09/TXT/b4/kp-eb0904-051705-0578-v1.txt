BULL, John, a distinguished English composer and organist, was born in Somersetshire about 1563. In 1591 he was appointed organist in the Queen’s chapel in succession to Blitheman, from whom he had received his musical education; in 1592 he received his degree of doctor of music at Cambridge University; and in 1596 he was made music professor at Gresham College, London. As he was unable to lecture in Latin according to the foundation-rules of that college, the executors of Sir Thomas Gresham made a dispensation in his favour by permitting him to lecture in English. He gave his first lecture on 6th October 1597. He afterwards visited France and Germany, and was everywhere received with the respect due to his talents. The story told by Anthony Wood of Dr Bull’s feat at St Omer, which consisted in adding, within a few hours, forty parts to a composition already written in forty parts, is simply impossible. Honourable employments were offered to him by various Continental princes; but he declined them, and returned to England, where he was appointed organist to James I. in 1607, and in the same year resigned his Gresham professorship. In 1613 he again went to the Continent on account of his health; and, in the Netherlands, entered into the service of the archduke. In 1617 he was appointed organist to the cathedral of Nôtre Damo [9:4:518] at Antwerp, and lie died in that city on the 12th March 1628. The usual statement that he died at an earlier date at Hamburg or Lübeck is incorrect. Little of his music has been published, and the opinions of critics differ much as to its merits. A claim made on his behalf to the composition of the music of the English national anthem has given rise to much discussion, but it seems now generally agreed that the claim is not well founded. Contemporary writers speak in the highest terms of Bulbs skill as a performer on the organ and the virginals.
