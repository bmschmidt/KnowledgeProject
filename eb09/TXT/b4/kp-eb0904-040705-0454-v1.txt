BRYAXIS, a Greek sculptor, the contemporary of Scopas and Praxiteles, with whom he took part in the sculptures of the mausoleum at Halicarnassus, about 345 b.c. Of his other works the following are mentioned :â€”five colossal figures of gods at Rhodes, Bacchus (Liber Pater) at Cnidus, a group of Aesculapius and Hygeia at Megara, Apollo in the grove of Daphne at Antioch, a statue of Pasiphae, and [9:4:408] a portrait of Seleucus (it is not said which). On doubtful authority he is also said to have been the sculptor of a group of Jupiter and Apollo with a lion at Patara, and of a statue of Serapis. Before his time there is no mention of statues of Aesculapius or Serapis, and it is supposed that the types which we now have of these deities were introduced by Bryaxis. The statue of Apollo at Daphne represented the god in his character of Musagetes, with long flowing drapery girt at the waist. The Bacchus at Cnidus must have been similarly draped; and altogether Bryaxis seems to have shown as much preference for draped and mature forms as Praxiteles displayed for nude and youthful figures.
