BREMERHAVEN - , a seaport town belonging to the free city of Bremen, on the right bank of the Weser at the mouth of the Geest, in 53° 32' N. lat. and 8° 34' E. long. It is built on a piece of ground surrendered to Bremen in 1827 by Hanover, and increased by treaty with Prussia in 1869. The port was opened in 1830, and there are now, besides an excellent harbour, four large wet docks, five dry docks, hydraulic cranes, and lines of railway running along the quays. The entrance is free from ice nearly all the year round, even when the other ports of the neighbouring coasts are closed, and vessels drawiug 22 feet can enter safely. The town is rapidly extending and will soon be united with Geestemünde. Among its public buildings the most remarkable is the great hospitium for emigrants, erected in 1830, which can accommodate 2500 persons. The Hanoverian fort and batteries, which formerly protected the town, have been removed, and their place is supplied by similar works farther down. The population, which in 1850 was only 3500, amounted in 1871 to 10,596.
