BRUNET, Jacques Charles, the eminent bibliographer, was born at Paris in 1780, and died in 1867. He was the son of a bookseller, and at an early age began the study which occupied the whole of his after life. In 1802 he printed a supplement to the Dictionnaire Bibliographique of Duclos and Cailleau, and in 1810 there appeared the first edition of his chef-dâ€™oeuvre, the Manuel du Libraire. With the exception of a few pamphlets and minor dissertations, Brunet published nothing beyond successive editions of his great bibliographical dictionary, which had come to be recognized as the first book of its class in European literature. The last (fifth) edition in six volumes was completed in 1865.
