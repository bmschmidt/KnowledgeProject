BROWNE, J ames, LL.D., man of letters, for a number of years sub-editor of the seventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, was born at Coupar-Angus in 1793. He was educated at Edinburgh and afterwards removed to St Andrews, where he studied for the church. He wrote The History of Edinburgh for Ewbank’s Picturesque Views of that city, 2 vols.,1823-25. In 1826 he became a member of the Faculty of Advocates, and obtained the degree of LL.D, from King’s College, Aberdeen; and in this same year he published a Critical Examination of Macculloch ’ s Work on the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. In 1827 he published at Paris his Aperçu sur les Hieroglyphe» d ’ Egypte ; and in the following year there appeared his Vindication of the Scottish Bar from the Attacks of Mr Brougham. He was now appointed editor of the Caledonian Mercury; and two years later he became sub-editor of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, to which he contributed a large number of valuable articles. He also published in 1838 a History of the Highlands and Highland Clans, 4 vols. 8vo, of which various editions have since appeared. His mental activity was remarkable, and frequently urged him to exertions beyond his strength. He died in 1841, from a stroke of apoplexy, brought on by his unremitting labours.
