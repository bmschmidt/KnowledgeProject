BURNOUF, Eug⅛ne (1801-1852), an Oriental scholar, was born at Paris in 1801. He was educated for the legal profession, but soon after taking his degree began to devote himself entirely to the study of Oriental languages. In 1826 he published an Essai sur le Pali, and in the following year Observations Grammaticales sur quelques Passages de Γ Essai sur le Pali. The next great work he undertook was the deciphering of the Zend mauuscripts brought to France by Anquetil du Perron. By his labours a knowledge of the Persian language and religion was first brought into the scientific world of Europe. He caused the Vendidad Sa.de to be lithographed with the utmost care, and published it in folio, 1829-43. The contributions he made to Oriental literature in the Journal Asiatique were numerous and important. From 1833 to 1835 he published his Commentaries sur le Yaçna, l'un des livres liturgiques des Perses; in 1840 he began the publication of the Sanskrit text and French translation of the Elιagavata Purana, which was completed in three folio volumes. His last works were Introduction à l’Histoire du Bouddhisme Indien, and a translation of Le Lotus de la Bonne Loi. The latter work was passing through the press when the author died on the 28th May 1852 He was a member of the Académie des Inscriptions, and from 1832 had held the post of professor of Sanskrit in the Collège de France.
