BOREAS, in Greek Mythology, was a personification of the north wind, and to be like it he was represented as rough, powerful, and accustomed to gain his ends by irresistible force. A favourite instance of this was the story of his carrying off the beautiful Oreithyia, a daughter of Erechtheus, king of Athens, when he found her gathering flowers by the banks of the Ilissus, or at the sources of the Cephisus,—others said the Areopagus, and others, again, the Citadel. lie had sought before to woo her in vain, and now carried her to Mount Ilaemus in Thrace, where they lived as king and queen of the winds, and had two sons, Zetes and Calais, and two daughters, Cleopatra and Chione. For the loss of Oreithyia the Athenians in after times counted on Boreas’s friendliness, and were assured of it when he sent storms which wrecked the Persian fleet at Athos and at Sepiae. For this they erected to him a sanctuary, or, as others said, an altar near the Ilissus, and held a festival in his honour. Thurii also, which was a colony of Athens, offered a sacrifice to him every year, because he had destroyed the hostile fleet of Dionysius the elder. Boreas was described as a son of Astraeus and Aurora. In works of art he was represented as bearded, powerful, draped agaiust cold, and winged. On the Tower of the Winds at Athens he is figured holding a shell, such as is blown by Tritons. Boreas carrying off Oreithyia is the subject of a beautiful bronze relief in the British Museum, found in the island of Calymna. The same subject occurs frequently on the painted Greek vases.
