BRADY, Nicholas. D.D., whose name is familiar as the translator, in conjunction with Tate, of a new metrical version of the Psalms, was born at Bandon in the county of Cork in October 1659. He received his early education at Westminster school, and then studied at Christ Church, Oxford; but he graduated at Trinity College, Dublin. He was in due time made a prebendary of Cork. He was a zealous promoter of the Revolution and suffered in consequence. When the troubles broke out in Ireland in 1690, Brady, by his influence, thrice prevented the burning of the town of Bandon, after James II. had given orders for its destruction; and the same year he was employed by the people of Bandon to lay their grievances before the English parliament. He soon afterwards settled in London, where he obtained various preferments. At the time of his death in 1726 he held the livings of Clapham and Richmond. Besides his version of the Psalms, which was licensed in 1696, he translated Virgilâ€™s Aeneid, and wrote several smaller poems and dramas. His prose works consist of sermons.
