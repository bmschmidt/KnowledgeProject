BORISSOGLIEBSK, a town of Russia, in the government of Tamboff, 11⅜ miles S.E. of that city, in 51° 22' N. lat. and 41° 4' E. long., on the left bank of the River Vorona. It was founded in 1646 to defend the southern frontiers from the incursions of the Crim Tatars, and in 1696 was surrounded by wooden fortifications by command of Peter I. The public buildings include four churches, a hospital, and two schools; the principal industries are the preparation of wool, the manufacture of cast-iron, soapboiling, tallow-melting, and brick-making; and the trade, which is decidedly important, consists in grain, wool, cattle, and leather. There are two annual fairs, and markets twice a week. Population in 1867, 12,254.
