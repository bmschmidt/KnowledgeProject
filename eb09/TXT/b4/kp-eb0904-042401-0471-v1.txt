BUDAeUS, or Bud√©, Guillaume (1467-1540), descended of an ancient and illustrious family, was a native of Paris. At an early age he was sent to the schools of Paris, and afterwards to the university of Orleans to study law. He passed his time, however, in idleness, and being heir to a large fortune, was left, on his return to Paris, to follow his passion for gaming and pleasure. It was only when the fire of youth began to cool that he was seized with an irresistible passion for study; and having disposed of his hunting equipage, he abandoned business of every description, and applied himself wholly to literature. Without assistance, he made rapid progress, particularly in the Latin and Greek languages. The work which gained him greatest reputation was his treatise De Asse, the first edition of which was published at Paris in 1514, He was held in high esteem by'Francis I., who was persuaded by him and by Du Bellay to found the Royal College of France, for teaching languages and sciences. He was sent by the king to Rome as ambassador to Leo X., and in 1522 was made master of requests. He died in Paris in 1540. Of his works, printed at Basel in 4 vols, folio in 1557, the most important is the Commentarii Groecoe Linguae, which first appeared in 1529.
