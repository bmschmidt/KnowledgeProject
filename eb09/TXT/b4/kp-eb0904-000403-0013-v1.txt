BOLI, a town of Asiatic Turkey, in Anatolia, situated about 85 miles N.W. of Angora, on the Philios Chai, to the south of the Boli Dagh, in 31° 40' E. long, and 40° 45' N. lat. It is the capital of a sandjak and the seat of a governor, and contains a ruined castle and numerous mosques and baths, nowise remarkable in their structure. Cotton and leather are manufactured; the country around is fertile, and in the neighbourhood is a forest, from which Constantinople is largely supplied with wood. There are warm springs in the vicinity. Boli is built not far from what is regarded by Leake as the ruins of Hadrianopolis, where many marble fragments with Greek inscriptions are still found. The population is coniecturally stated at 10,000.
