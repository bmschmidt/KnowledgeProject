BRIEG, the capital of a circle in the Prussian province of Silesia and government of Breslau, is situated on the left bank of the Oder, and on the Breslau and Oppeln Railway, 27 miles S.E. of the former town. It is well built, and has. a castle (the residence of the old Piastic counts of Brieg), a lunatic asylum, a gymnasium with a good library, and several churches and hospitals. Its fortifications were destroyed by the French in 1807, and are now replaced by beautiful promenades. Brieg carries on a considerable trade, its chief manufactures being linen, cotton, and woollen goods, porcelain and machinery, hats, pasteboard, and cigars. Important cattle-markets are held there. Brieg, or, as it is called in early documents, Civitas Altae Ripae, obtained municipal rights in 1250 from Duke Henry III. of Breslau, and was fortified in 1297; its n ame is derived from the Polish Brzeg (shore). In the 14th century it became the seat of a line of counts, by one of whom the castle was built in 1341. Burned by the Hussites in 1428, the town was soon afterwards rebuilt, and in 1595 it was again fortified by Duke Joachim Frederick. In the Thirty Yearsâ€™ War it suffered greatly; in that of the Austrian succession it was heavily bombarded by the Prussian forces; and in 1806 it was captured by the French. Population in 1871, 15,372.
