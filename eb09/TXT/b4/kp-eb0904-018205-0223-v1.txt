BOYDELL, John, an engraver, chiefly known by his plates illustrating Shakespeare, was born at Dorrington in 1719. At the age of twenty-one he came to London and was apprenticed for seven years to an engraver. In 1746 he published a volume of views in England and Wales, and started in business as a printscller. By his good taste and liberality he managed to secure the services of the best artists, and his engravings were executed with such skill that his business became extensive and lucrative. He succeeded in his plan of a Shakespeare gallery, and obtained the assistance of the most eminent painters of the day, whose contributions were exhibited publicly for many years. The engravings from these paintings form a splendid companion volume to his large edition of Shakespeareâ€™s works. Towards the close of his life Boydell sustained severe losses through the French Revolution, and was compelled to dispose of his Shakespeare gallery by lottery. It had been his wish and intention to bequeath it to the nation. He died in 1804 before the lottery took place. Some years before his death he had held the position of Lord Mayor of London.
