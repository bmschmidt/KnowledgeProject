BULLINGER, Heinrich (1504-1575), an eminent Reformer, was born at Bremgarten, near Zurich. He studied at Emmerich and Cologne, where he read some of Luther’s works, and after his return home lectured at the abbey of Kappel. In 1527 he heard Zwingli at Zurich, and in the following year he accompanied him to the great conference at Berne. He was made pastor at Bremgarten in 1529, and married one Anna Adlischwegler, formerly a nun. In 1531 he had to fly to Zurich in consequence of the Catholic victory at Kappel, and was soon afterward appointed minister of the principal* church. He was a powerful upholder of the Zwinglian doctrine of the Lord’s Supper, and wrote an able defence against Luther. He had also numerous controversial writings against the Anabaptists. His printed works are very numerous, and many of them were translated into English. They form ten vols, folio. Bullinger died at Zurich in 1575.
