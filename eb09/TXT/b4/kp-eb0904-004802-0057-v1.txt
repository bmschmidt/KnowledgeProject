BOOMERANG, a missile instrument of the Australian aborigines, in the use of which they are very dexterous. It consists of a piece of hard wood, with the curve of a parabola, and is about 2 feet long, 2∣ inches broad, ⅜ inch thick, and rounded at the extremities. One side is flat, the other is rounded, and it is brought to a bluntish edge. It is discharged with the hand by one end, the convex edge being forward and the flat side upwards. After advancing some distance, and ascending slowly in the air with a quick rotatory motion, it begins to retrograde, and finally falls to the ground behind the thrower. A weapon of similar form, but wanting the return flight, has been found in use among sιvage tribes both in India and Africa. A very full comparative account of the boomerang is contained in Colonel A. H. Lane Fox’s lecture on “Primitive Warfare” {Jour. of the Royal United Service Institution, vol. xii. No. 51).
