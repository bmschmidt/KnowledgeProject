BORGO SAN DONNINO, a walled town of Italy, in the province of Parma, and capital of a circondario, is situated on the Stirone, a sub-tributary of the Po, about 15 miles W. of Parma on the railway to Milan. Besides its cathedral, a building of the 13th century, in the Lombard style, adorned with rude sculptures, it possesses a castle and fort, a theological seminary, a college, a music school, and a remarkable institution for mendicants. The spinning of hemp and silk and the manufacture of glass are its principal industries. Borgo is identified with Fidentia, memorable in ancient history for the siege sustained by Μ. Lucullus, one of Sulla’s generals, against the forces of Carbo. It is mentioned as a municipium by Pliny, but seems afterwards to have sunk to a mere village. In 304 it was the scene of the martyrdom of Saint Domninus, from whom it has derived the distinctive part of its modern name. During the Hohenstauffen dynasty it was an imperial possession, and in 1501 it became the seat of a bishop. Population, 10,855.
