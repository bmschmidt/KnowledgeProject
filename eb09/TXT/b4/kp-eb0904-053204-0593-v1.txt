BURGDORF (in French, Berthoud), a town in the Swiss canton of Bern, on the River Emme, about 14 miles by railway from the chief city. It is situated 1840 feet above the level of the sea, and consists of an upper and lower part, which are connected by a spiral arrangement of streets. Its houses are substantially built, and it has an ancient castle, a town-house, a hospital, an orphanage, and a public library. Ribbons and damask, tobacco and chocolate are manufactured; and a large trade is carried on in the dairy produce of the Emmenthal. From the Lueg about 4⅛ miles to the N.E. a view of the whole Bernese Alps can be obtained. The castle of Burgdorf was built at a very early date, and the town became the capital of Lesser Burgundy and the residence of the dukes of Zähringen. In 1270 they were succeeded by the lords of Kyburg, who, in 1326, pawned their possessions to Ulrich of Signan. In 1384 the town and countship were purchased by Bern for 37,000 florins, and the Bernese magistrates held rule till 1798. Pestalozzi had his educational establishment in the castle for a number of years. Population in 1870, 5078.
