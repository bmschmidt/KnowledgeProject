BOROVSK, a town of Russia, in the government of Kaluga, 54 miles from that city on the old post road to Moscow, is situated on both banks of the Protva at the confluence of the Tikizh, in 55° 13' N. lat. and 36° 9' E. long. The town was in existence in the 13th century, and derived its name from the Borh, or pine forest, which still lies to the N.W. Its principal industries are tanning, soapboiling, and the manufacture of wax, linseed-oil, and pottery; and it has a trade of considerable importance in grain, hemp, and cloth. There are four annual fairs, two of which are held in the town and two about two miles off, at the monastery of Paphnutius, which was founded in 1444. The population, mainly belonging to the Greek Church, was in 1860, 8150.
