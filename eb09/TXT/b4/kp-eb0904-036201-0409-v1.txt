BROMLEY, a market-town of England, in the county of Kent, 10 miles S.E. of London. It is situated on high ground to the north of the river Ravensbourne, and since the opening of the railway has become a favourite residence for men of business from London. It has a town-hall—built in 1864, an old market-house, a literary institution, and a college, originally founded in 1666 by Bishop Warner for the residence and support of clergymen’s widows. The church is a fine Gothic building, containing some handsome monuments; and in the vicinity is a palace, erected in 1777 in room of an older structure, for the bishops of Rochester, to whom the manor has belonged since the time of Ethelbert. In the gardens attached is a mineral spring known as St Blaze’s Well, which was in great repute before the Reformation. The population of the parish, which in 1861 was only 5505, amounted at the census of 1871 to 10,674. The parish includes the villages of Plaistow, Sundridge, Bickley, Widmore, Elmstead, Southboro’, and Bromley Common.
