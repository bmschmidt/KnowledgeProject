BRIEL, Brielle, or Bril, a fortified seaport town of Holland, in the province of South Holland, and capital of an arrondissement, stands on the north side of the island of Voorne, near the mouth of the Maese, 14 miles west of Rotterdam, in 51° 54' 1 1" N. lat. and 4° 9' 5Γ ’ E: long. The town is well built and strongly fortified, and has an arsenal, military magazines, barracks, and a good harbour. The tower of St Catharine’s church serves as a lighthouse. Briel is remarkable in history as having been the first place captured in the strugglo that resulted in the independence of the Netherlands—a fact which is commemorated in the popular rhyme, Den eerste van April verloor due d , Albe syne Bril, punning on the meaning of Bril, which is the Dutch for “spectacles.” Admiral Van Tromp was born in the town. The inhabitants, who are principally engaged as fishermen and pilots, numbered 4058 in 1869.
