BRIVES-LA-GAILLARDE, a town of France, capital of an arrondissement in the department of Corr√®ze, situated in a beautiful and fertile plain twenty miles from Tulle. It is surrounded with elm-planted boulevards, and possesses a number of well-preserved houses of an early date. None of its public buildings (which comprise several churches, a theological seminary, and a college) are of much importance, except the church of St Martin, dating from the 13th century. The town carries on an active trade in cattle, wool, wine, oil, and grain, manufactures wax candles, copperwares, and cotton thread, and has millstone and slate quarries. Brives is of ancient origin, and for a long time disputed the title of capital of the Lower Limousin with the city of Tulle. It was the birthplace of the Cardinal Dubois. Population in 1872, 8417.
