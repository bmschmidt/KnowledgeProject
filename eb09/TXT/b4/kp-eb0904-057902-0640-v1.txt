BUTADES, wrongly called Dibutades, a Greek modeller in clay, whom fable describes as the first who modelled the human face in that material. The story is that his daughter, smitten with love for a youth at Corinth where they lived, drew upon the wall the outline of his shadow, and that upon this outline her father modelled a face of the youth in clay, and baked the model along with the clay tiles which it was his trade to make. This model was preserved in Corinth till Mummius sacked that town. This incident led Butades to ornament the ends of roof-tiles with human faces, a practice which is attested by numerous existing examples. He was a native of Sicyon, and probably lived about 600 B.c., at which date Corinth seems to have been a flourishing centre of working in clay.
