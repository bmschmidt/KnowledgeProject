BOZZARIS, Marcos, a Greek patriot, was born in Suli towards the close of the 18th century. With the remnant of the Suliotes he crossed in 1803 to the Ionian islands, and in 1820, with some 800 of his countrymen, joined the sultan against Ali Pasha. They soon, however, came over to Altâ€™s party, and fought gallantly against their old enemies the Turks. After the death of Ali the Suliotes carried on the war with great success, and in 1822 were joined by a body of regular troops under Prince Mavrocordato. At the battle of Petta the Greeks were betrayed and defeated with heavy loss. Bozzaris fell back to Missolonghi, which he successfully defended until the arrival of a Hydriote fleet compelled the besiegers to retire. In the summer of 1823 he learned that a large Turkish force had again been despatched against the town, and resolving to anticipate the attack, he set out secretly with 1200 men. On the 20th of August he came upon the encampment of the Turkish vanguard, and a night attack was crowned with success. The victory of the Suliotes was saddened by the loss of Bozzaris, who fell while leading on his men. The assault on the Turkish camp has been made the subject of a very fine poem by Fitz-Greene Halleck.
