BUG, a name common to all the species belonging to the Cimiddoe, a family of Hemipterous Insects, the best known example of which is the House Bug or Bed Bug (Cimex lectularius). This disgusting insect is of an oval shape, of a rusty red colour, and, in common with the whole tribe to which it belongs, gives off an offensive odour when touched; unlike the others, however, it is wingless. The bug is provided with a proboscis, which when at rest lies along the inferior side of the thorax, and through which it sucks the blood of man, the sole food of this species. It is nocturnal in its habits, remaining concealed by day in crevices of bed furniture, among the hangings, or behind the wall paper, and shows considerable activity in its nightly raids in search of food. The female deposits her eggs at the beginning of summer in crevices of wood and other retired situations, and in three weeks they emerge as small, white, and almost transparent larvae. These change their skin very frequently before undergoing metamorphosis, which in their case is “incomplete,” the pupa closely resembling the perfect insect, and attaining its full development in eleven weeks. Two centuries ago it was a rare insect in Britain, and probably owes its name, which is derived from a Celtic word signifying “ghost” or “goblin,”to the terrorwhich its attacks at first inspired. Other species of bugs suck the blood of many of the lower warm-blooded animals, but the majority, as in the genus Tingis, confine themselves to the juices of plants.
