BURNEY, Charles (1757-1817), son of the preceding, an eminent classical scholar, was born at Lynn, in Norfolk, in 1757. At the age of eleven he was sent to the Charterhouse in London, whence he removed to Caius College, Cambridge. He quitted the university without taking his degree; but in 1791 he received the diploma of LL.D. from Aberdeen, and in 1808 that of D.D. from Cambridge. In 1783 he married the daughter of Dr Rose, the translator of Sallust, and continued for some time to assist his father-in-law in the management of his academy. He contributed at this time many articles to the Monthly Review, and afterwards edited for two or three years the London Magazine. Some of his contributions to the first of these periodicals gained him much credit not only among English but among Continental scholars. In the course of time he realized a handsome fortune, great part of which ho expended in the formation of his splendid library. The manuscripts and rare books collected by him were considered so valuable that at his death, which happened in 1817, they were purchased by the nation and deposited in the British Museum.
