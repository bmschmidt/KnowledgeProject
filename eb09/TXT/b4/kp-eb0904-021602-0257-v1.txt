BRANTFORD, a town of the Dominion of Canada, in the province of Ontario, capital of the county of Brant, is situated on the Grand River, about 24 miles south-west of Hamilton. It is an important station on the Goderich and Buffalo line, with extensive engine-works and foundries. Brass, iron, and tin wares, agricultural implements, window blinds, and pottery are its principal manufactures. It is lighted with gas, and has a good supply of water. As the river is not navigable as far as the town, a canal has been constructed which gives communication with Lake Erie. There are fine county buildings, ten churches, an orphanage, banks, and A newspaper offices. Population in 1871, 8107.
