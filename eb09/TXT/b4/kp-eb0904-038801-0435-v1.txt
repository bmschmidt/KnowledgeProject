After studying at Limerick, Rome, and Prague he entered the army, becoming in 1723 captain in the regimeht of his uncle, Couut George Brown, and in 1725 lieutenant-colonel.

After the death of the Emperor Charles VI. he became one of the foremost generals in the army of the Empress-Queen Maria Theresa, and gained a high reputation for military skill.
