BOYLE, John, earl of Cork and Orrery, a nobleman distinguished for his literary attainments, was the only son of the subject of last notice, and was born January 2, 1707. He was educated at Christ Church College, Oxford, and was led by indifferent health and many untoward accidents to cultivate in retirement his talents for literature and poetry. His works are neither numerous nor remarkable. His translation of the Letters of Pliny the Younger, with various notes, for the use of his eldest son, was published in 1751, 2 vols. 4to. He also published a Life of Swift, in several letters addressed to his second son, and Memoirs of Robert Carey, Earl of Monmouth, from a manuscript presented to him by a relation. He died November 16, 1762. His letters from Italy did not appear until 1774, when they were edited, with his life prefixed, by the Rev. J. Duncombe.
