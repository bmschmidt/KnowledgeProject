He had considerable practice as a conveyancer, and after the passing of the Act Geo. III. c. 32 was called to the bar in 1791. In 1832 he received the silk gown, and was made a bencher of Lincoln’s Inn. He died on the 2d J une in the same year. His literary activity was enormous, and the number of his published works is very great. The most important of them are the Reminiscences, 1821-1827; Horae Biblicae, ∖ r Vfl, which has passed through several editions; Horae Juridicoe Subsecivae, 1804; Book of the Roman Catholic Church, which was directed against Southey and excited some controversy; lives of Erasmus, Grotius, and some others.
