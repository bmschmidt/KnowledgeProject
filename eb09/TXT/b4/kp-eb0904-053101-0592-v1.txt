BUPALUS and ATHENIS, Greek sculptors, about 540 B.c., lived in the island of Chios, which at that time had a school of sculptors who had acquired some celebrity by their works in marble, which material they had introduced as a substitute for the bronze and wood previously employed for sculpture. Bupalus was the more celebrated of the two brothers. Their father was Archermus, also a sculptor; and it seems from the few notices of their works which exist, that they produced only draped figures, from which it is inferred that their art had not yet advanced to the study of the human figure itself. The Graces, who are now only known as nude figures, were represented as draped by Bupalus for the Temple of Nemesis in Smyrna. He is said also to have made a figure of Tyche (Fortune) for that town. They worked apparently only for the towns in Asia Minor and the Greek islands. Yet Pliny {Nat. Hist, xxxvi. 11) says that sculptures from their hands were to be seen in the pediment of the temple of Apollo on the Palatine at Rome, whither they had been brought by Augustus, who seems to have had a taste for early Greek work. But if this is true, and if the figures at all fitted into the peculiar space of a temple pediment, it would follow that they had originally been designed for a similar purpose, and that, therefore, these early artists were able to produce figures for architectural decoration, which hardly seems probable. There is a story that Bupalus had made a caricature portrait of the poet Hipponax, who was known for his ugliness, and that the poet replied by some verses, the sting of which caused the sculptor to hang himself.
