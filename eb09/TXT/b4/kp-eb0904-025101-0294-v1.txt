BREGENTZ, the ancient Brigantia, capital of the circle of Vorarlberg, in Tyrol, stands on a hill at the S.E. end of the Lake of Constance. It has an old castle, two convents, and an orphanage. Silk and cotton are manufactured[9:4:252], and it carries on an active transit trade. It was long the seat of a Roman garrison, and in the Middle Ages it gave the title to a powerful family of counts, whose territory passed to Austrian possession in the 16th century. In 1646. the town was captured by the Swedes; and in 1850 it gave its name to a treaty by which Austria, Bavaria, and WÃ¼rtemberg formed an alliance against Prussia. Population in 1869, 3686.
