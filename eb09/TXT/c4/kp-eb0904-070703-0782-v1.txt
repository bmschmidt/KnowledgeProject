CALIXTUS, the name of three different popes or bishops of Rome. Little is known of Calixtus I., bishop of Rome from about 220-226 a.d., during the reigns of Heliogabalus and Severus. Calixtus IL, Guido of Vienne, was elected in 1119, after the death of Gelasius II. In 1122 he concluded with the Emperor Henry the important treaty of Mentz, by which the mutual rights of the church and the empire were definitely settled. He died in December 1124. Calixtus III., Alphonso de Borgia, was raised to the Papal chair in 1455 at a very advanced age. He was feeble and incompetent. The great object of his policy was the excitement of a crusade against the Turks, but he did not find the Christian princes responsive to his call. He died in 1458.
