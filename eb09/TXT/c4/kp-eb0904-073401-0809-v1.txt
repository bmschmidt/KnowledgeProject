CAMDEN (1), a city of the United States, capital of Camden county, New York, situated on the left bank of the Delaware River, directly opposite Philadelphia, with which it is connected by a regular steam-boat service. It lies 87 miles S.W. of New York, and is the terminus of several railway lines. Among its public buildings the chief place is held by the court-house and the railway stations; and its principal industrial establishments are iron-foundries, saw-mills, chemical works, glass-works, shipyards, and engineering factories. The city received its charter in 1831; and gas-light was first introduced in 1852. In 1840 the population was only 3371; in 1850 it amounted to 9479, and in 1870 to 20,045.
