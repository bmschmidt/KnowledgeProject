CALLISTRATUS, an Athenian orator, whose eloquence made such an impression on Demosthenes that he resolved to devote himself to oratory. On account of the surrender of Oropus to the Thebans Callistratus, despite his magnificent defence, was condemned to death, 361 b.c. He fled to Methone in Macedonia, where it is said he founded the city of Datum, afterwards Philippi. Having returned to Athens, he was put to death.
