CANDELABRUM, in Classical Antiquities, a stand for a lamp or lamps, usually of such a height as, when placed on the floor, to be serviceable to a person seated or reclining on a couch. The material varied according to the circumstances of the owner; only those of bronze have survived; but they are many. Generally the form consists of a heavy base resting on three spreading claws. From the base rises a tall usually fluted stem, branching out at the top into two or more arms from which the lamps were hung. On candelabra of this simple form the only place available for ornament was the top of the stem, on which a statuette or a group of figures could be placed; and it appears that very many of the small bronze statuettes now existing in museums had originally served this purpose. Or the lower part of the stem, immediately above the base, could be converted into a figure supporting the stem, as may be seen in several very beautiful examples in the British Museum. There was, however, no limit to the extent to which the original form might be departed from, as many of the candelabra from Pompeii show.
