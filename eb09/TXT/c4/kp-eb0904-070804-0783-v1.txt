CALLIMACHUS, a celebrated Greek poet, was a native of Cyrene, and a descendant of the illustrious house of [9:4:709] the Battiadae, whence by Ovid and others he is called Battiades. He flourished under Ptolemies Philadelphus and Euergetes, and probably succeeded Zenodotus as chief librarian of the famous Alexandrian library, an office he held from about 260 B.c. till his death, which took place about 240 b.c. He was regarded, according to Quintilian, as the prince of Greek elegiac poets. His style is elegant and nervous, yet his excellences are rather the result of excessive elaboration than of genuine poetic power: hence Ovid (Am., i. 15) says of him— Quamvis ingenio non valet, arte valet. Perhaps the Hymn to Apollo should be excepted from this criticism. Callimachus was a learned critic and grammarian, and the instructor of Eratosthenes, Aristophanes of Byzantium, and Apollonius Rhodius. He wrote in prose and in verse on a great variety of subjects; but his only existing works are six hymns, seventy-three epigrams, and some fragments of elegies. Of the various imitations of Callimachus by the Roman poets, the small poem by Catullus, De coma Berenices, is the most celebrated.

Among the numerous editions of his works the following may be noticed :—By Graevius with Spanheim’s Commentary, Utrecht, 1697; by Ernesti, Leyden, 1761; by Bloomfield, Lond., 1815; by Volzer, Lips. 1817; Fragmenta, by Naeke, 1844; Hymni ei Epigrammata, by Meineke, 1861; Callimachca, by Schneider,—i. (Hymni), 1870, ii., 1847.
