CALABOZO, or Calaboso, a town of Venezuela, formerly capital of the province of Caracas, but now of that of Guarico, is situated 120 miles S.S.W. of the city of Caracas on the left bank of the River Guarico. It lies so low that during the rainy season it is frequently surrounded by the floods; and in the summer it is exposed to extreme heat, the average temperature being 88Â° Fahr. It is well built, with streets running at right angles, and it has several fine churches, a college, and public schools. Its situation on the main road from Aragua to Apure makes it the seat of a considerable trade; and the surrounding country affords extensive pasture for cattle. There are thermal springs in the neighbourhood. Originally a small Indian village, Calabozo owes its existence as a town to the Compania Guipuzcoana, who made it the seat of one of their mercantile stations in the beginning of the 18th century. In 1820 it was the scene of a battle in which Bolivar and Paez beat the Spanish general Morales. Population in 1873, 5618.
