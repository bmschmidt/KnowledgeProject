CAeSAREA, or Kaisariéh, a city in Asiatic Turkey, formerly one of the most important places in Cappadocia, and at present the chief town of a sanjak in the province of Karaman, situated on the Kara-su, between two spurs of the Mons Argaeus, in 38° 42' N. lat. and 35° 20' E. long. It is the seat of an Armenian bishop, and the commercial centre of an extensive and highly populous district; its markets are well supplied with European goods, and its inhabitants noted for their enterprise. Its principal manufactures are cotton and morocco leather. Recently it has become the scene of a considerable Protestant movement, and a girls’ school, the first in the city, has been established. The ruins of an earlier Mahometan town are immediately contiguous, and a little to the south are the ruins of the ancient city. The latter was known originally as Mazaca, and afterwards as Eusebia; and only received its present name from the Emperor Tiberius. It was for a time the seat of the Cappadocian kings; but it suffered greatly at the hands of Tigranes, who carried off its inhabitants to his new city of Tigranocerta Under the later Roman empire it recovered to such an extent that it was supposed to contain 400,000 inhabitants when it was captured by Sapor in the reign of Valerian. The present population, of which about two-thirds are Turks and the rest mainly Armenians and Greeks, is estimated at about 10,000.
