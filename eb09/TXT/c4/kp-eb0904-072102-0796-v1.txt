CALYDON (Καλυδών), an ancient town of Aetolia, 7½ miles from the sea, on the River Evenus. It was said to have been founded by Calydon, son of Aetolus; to have been the scene of the hunting, by Meleager and other heroes, of the famous Calydonian boar, sent by Artemis to lay waste the fields; and to have taken part in the Trojan war. In historical times, it is first mentioned (391 B.c.) as in the possession of the Achaeans, who retained it for twenty years, by the assistance of the Lacedaemonian king Agesilaus, notwithstanding the attacks of the Acarnanians. After the battle of Leuctra (371 B.c.) it was restored by Epaminondas to the Aetolians. In the time of Pompey it was a town of importance; but Augustus removed its inhabitants to Nicopolis, which he founded to commemorate his victory at Actium (31 B.c.)
