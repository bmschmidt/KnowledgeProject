CAMERARIUS, Joachim (1534-1598), a learned physician, son of the preceding, was born at Nuremberg, 6th November 1534. After having finished his studies in Germany he visited Italy, where he graduated as doctor of medicine. On his return he was invited to reside at the courts of several princes; but he was too much devoted to the study of chemistry and botany to accept their offers. He settled in his native town of Nuremberg, where he practised as a physician, and was the chief agent in founding a medical school. He wrote a Hortus Medicus, and several other works. He died on the 11th October 1598.
