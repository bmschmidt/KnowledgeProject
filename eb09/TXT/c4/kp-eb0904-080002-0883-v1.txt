CANCAO, Cancar, or Kang-Kao, otherwise known as Ponthiamus or Potai-mat, or in Chinese, Ha Thian, the capital of a small state in Western Cambodia, on the eastern side of the Gulf of Siam, at the mouth of the River Cancao or Klong Chanda; in 10° 14' N. lat. and 104° 55' E. long. The town was once a great centre of Cambodian trade, its port having been declared free by a man of Chinese origin, who took advantage of the civil troubles of Siam to effect his purpose. In 1717, however, the Siamese expelled the merchants who had flocked to the place; and though a considerable, exportation of rice and salt is still maintained, the prosperity of the town has largely diminished. The harbour is shallow, though the river in general has a great depth of water. A canal gives communication with the Mekong River.
