CAMPEGGIO, or Campeggi, Lorenzo (1479-1539), Cardinal, was born at Bologna in 1479. He was the son of an eminent lawyer, and for some years was himself engaged in the legal profession. But after the death of his wife he entered the church and quickly attained to high office. For his services to the Papal cause during the reduction of Bologna, Pope Julius II. raised him to the rank of bishop, and sent him as nuncio to Germany and Milan. In 1517 he became cardinal, and two years later he was sent to England to stir up a religious crusade against the Turks. He was unsuccessful in this mission, but received from Henry VIII., in 1524, the bishopric of Salisbury. Towards the close of 1528 he came over to England to assist Wolsey with regard to Henryâ€™s contemplated divorce from Katherine. He failed to accomplish anything, and left in the following year. The bishopric of Salisbury was withdrawn from him, and though at a later date (1536) it seemed possible that he might regain it, his expectations were disappointed. He died at Rome in 1539, just as he was about to set out on an embassy to Vicenza.
