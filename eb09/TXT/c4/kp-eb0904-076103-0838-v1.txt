CAMPI, Giulio, the founder of a school of Italian painters, was born at Cremona about 1502, and died in 1572. He was son of a painter, Galeazzo Campi, under whom he took his first lessons in art. He was then taught by Giulio Romano; and he made a special study of Titian, Correggio, and Raffaelle. His works are remarkable for their correctness, vigour, and loftiness of style. They are very numerous, and the church of St Margaret in his native town owes all its paintings to his hand. Among the earliest of his school are his brothers, Vincenzo and Antonio, the latter of whom was also of some mark as a sculptor and as historian of Cremona.
