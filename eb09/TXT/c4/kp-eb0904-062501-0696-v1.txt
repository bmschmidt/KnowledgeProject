CACONGO, a small kingdom of Western Africa, separated from Congo by the river Zaire. The surface is mountainous but fruitful, the climate healthy though unsuited for Europeans. A strong tendency to adopt European customs and conveniences is displayed by the inhabitants, who carry on a considerable trade at the seaport towns of Mallemba and Cabinda. The capital is Kinguela.
