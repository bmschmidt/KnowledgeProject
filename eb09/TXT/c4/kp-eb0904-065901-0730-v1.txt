CALDANI, Leopold Marco Antonio (1725-1813), a distinguished Italian anatomist and physician, was born at Bologna in 1725. After holding various minor appointments, he was chosen assistant to the celebrated anatomist Morgagni at Padua; but disgusted with the envy which his distinguished position drew upon him, he removed to Venice. Soon after, however, he was appointed to the professorship of the theory of medicine, with the promise of being elected to succeed Morgagni, who was then old and infirm. In 1772 he published his Elements of Pathology, and soon afterwards the Elements of Physiology. In the same year he took possession of the chair of anatomy, vacant by the death of Morgagni, and endeavoured, though without success, to found an anatomical museum. At the age of seventy-six, though threatened with blindness, he published, with the assistance of his nephew, a valuable series of anatomical plates. He died in 1813, at the age of eighty-eight.
