CANDLEMAS, a church festival, held on the 2d of February, which has in Scotland been chosen as one of the four term-days. The festival commemorates the purification of the Virgin; and the observances to which it owes its name, viz., the lighting of candles, and, in the Roman Catholic Church, the consecration of the candles which are to be used during the year for ecclesiastical purposes, are said to have an emblematical reference to the prophecy of Simeon that the child Jesus should become “a light to lighten the Gentiles.” The institution of this feast dates probably from the reign of Justinian, and the year 542 is sometimes fixed upon as that of its first celebration. It is supposed to have grown out of the heathen festivals held iu this month,—a view which is supported by the following considerations :—(1), The word February (connected with februare) denotes purification; (2), in this month the purification of the people took place; (3), the rites of the Lupercalia, which were celebrated on the 15 th, included the lighting of candles, in allusion to those used by Ceres in her search for Proserpine; and (4), the origin of other Christian feasts appears to have been similar.
