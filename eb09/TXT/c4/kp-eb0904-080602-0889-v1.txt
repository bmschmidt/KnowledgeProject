CANEPHORI was the title given to the girls who at Athens were annually selected from noble families to walk in the procession at the Panathenaic and apparently also at other festivals, carrying on their heads baskets containing the implements and apparatus necessary for a sacrifice. The gracefulness of the attitude which may be seen in the figures of Canephori on the frieze of the Parthenon in the British Museum, is known to have suggested itself as a subject for sculpture to Polycletus and Scopas. This type of statue also came to be used in architecture to support light entablatures, in which case they are sometimes identified with Caryatides.
