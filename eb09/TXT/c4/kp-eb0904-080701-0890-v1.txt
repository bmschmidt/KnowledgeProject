CANITZ, Friedrich Rodolph Ludwig, Baron von (1654-1699), a German poet and politician of noble family, was born at Berlin in 1654. He attended the universities of Leyden and Leipsic, and travelled in England, France, and Italy. In 1680 he became councillor of legation, and Frederick I. made him councillor of state, privy councillor, baron of the empire, and plenipotentiary at the Hague, all which positions he appears to have filled with credit. His reputation is, however, founded upon his verse. He believed that a great reform might be effected in German literature by the introduction of the rules of French taste; and, consequently, he became an imitator of Boileau, and through him of Horace,â€”the polished grace of whose verse he attained in some measure, though he does not always avoid turgidity and bombast.
