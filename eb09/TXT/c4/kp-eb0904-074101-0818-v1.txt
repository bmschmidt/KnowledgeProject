CAMERA OBSCURA, an optical apparatus, consisting of a darkened chamber, at the top of which is placed a box or lantern, containing a convex lens and sloping mirror, or a prism combining the lens and mirror. The rays of light from surrounding objects are received by the lens, and the mirror reflects images of the scenery downwards on a table placed underneath. This ingenious contrivance is said to have been invented by Baptista Porta in the end of the lfith century. For the camera obscura used by photographers see Photography.
