CALLCOTT, Sir Augustus Wall (1779-1844), Knt., R.A., one of the most distinguished of English landscape painters, was born at Kensington in 1779, and died there in 1844. His first study was music; and he sang for several years in the choir of Westminster Abbey. But at the age of twenty he had determined to give up music, and had exhibited his first painting at the Royal Academy. He gradually rose to distinction, and was elected au associate in 1807 and an academician in 1810. In 1827 he received the honour of knighthood; and, seven years later, was appointed surveyor of the royal pictures. His two principal subject picturesâ€”Raphael and the Fornarina, and Milton dictating to his Daughters, are much inferior to his landscapes, which are placed in the highest class by their refined taste and quiet beauty. Callcott always chose to paint nature in her lovely and placid aspect; and has therefore been called the English Claude.
