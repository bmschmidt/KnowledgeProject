CALVART, Denis (1555-1619), a Flemish painter, born at Antwerp in 1555. After studying landscapepainting for some time in his native city he went to Bologna, where he perfected himself in the anatomy of the human form under Prospero Fontana, and so completely lost the mannerism of Flemish art that his paintings appear to be the work of an Italian. From Bologna he went to Rome, where he assisted Sabbatini in his works for the Papal palace, and devoted much of his time to copying and studying the works of Raffaelle. He ultimately returned to Bologna, and founded a school, of which the greatest ornaments are Guido and Domen ichino. His works are especially admired for the power of grouping and colouring which they display. He died at Bologna in 1619
