CALAMY, Edmund (1671-1732), grandson of the preceding, was born in London, April 5, 1671. He was educated at a private academy, and studied at the university of Utrecht. While there, he declined an offer of a professor’s chair in the university of Edinburgh made to him by Principal Carstairs, who had gone over on purpose to find a person properly qualified for such an office. After his return to England in 1691 he began to study divinity; and having joined the Nonconformists, he was in 1692 unanimously chosen assistant to Matthew Sylvester at Blackfriars. In 1694 he was ordained at Annesley’s meeting-house in Little St Helen’s, and soon afterwards was invited to become assistant to Daniel Williams in Hand-Alley. In 1702 he was chosen one of the lecturers in Salters’ Hall, and in 1703 he succeeded Vincent Alsop as pastor of a large congregation in Westminster. He drew up the table of contents to Baxter’s History of his Life and Times, which was sent to the press in 1696; made some remarks on the work itself, and added to it an index; and, reflecting on the usefulness of the book, he saw the expediency of continuing it, as Baxter’s history came no farther than the year 1684. Accordingly, he composed an abridgment of it, with an account of many other ministers who were ejected after the restoration of Charles II.; their apology, containing the grounds of their nonconformity and practice as to stated and occasional communion with the Church of England; and a continuation of their history until the year 1691. This work was published in 1702. He afterwards published a moderate defence of nonconformity, in three tracts, in answer to some tracts of Dr Hoadly. In 1709 Calamy made a tour to Scotland, and had the degree of doctor of divinity conferred on him by the universities of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Glasgow. In 1713 he published a second edition of his Abridgment of Baxter's History of his Life and Times, in which, among various additions, there is a continuation of the history through the reigns of William and Anne, down to the passing of the Occasional Bill. At the end is subjoined the reformed liturgy, which was drawn up and presented to the bishops in 1661. In 1718 he wrote a vindication of his grandfather and several other persons against certain reflections cast upon them by Archdeacon Echard in his History of England; and in 1728 appeared his continuation of the account of the ministers, lecturers, masters, and fellows of colleges, and schoolmasters, who were ejected, after, the Restoration in 1660, by or before the Act of Uniformity. He died June 3, 1732. Besides the pieces already mentioned, he published many occasional sermons.
