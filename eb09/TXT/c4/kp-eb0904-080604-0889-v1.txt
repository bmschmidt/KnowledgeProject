CANGIAGI, or Cambiaso, Luigi (1527-1585), a distinguished painter, was born at Genoa in 1527, and died at the Escorial in 1585. He received his first lessons in the art of painting from his father, and completed his education at Rome, where he studied with particular care the masterpieces of Michelangelo. At a very early age he had gained a high reputation as an artist, and in 1583 he was invited to Spain by Philip IL, who desired his assistance in the decoration of the Escorial. He painted the ceiling of the choir, representing the Assemblage of the Blessed. It is considered his best work. Among his other productions which were highly esteemed were the Rape of the Sabine Women, the Sleeping Cupid, and Judith. Most of his paintings are in Genoa and Spain; the Sleeping Cupid is in the royal collection at Paris.
