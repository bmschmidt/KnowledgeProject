CANAL, or Canaletto, Antonio (1697—1768), a Venetian painter, born 18th October 1697, was bred with his father, a scene-painter at Venice, and for some time followed his father’s line of art. In 1719 he went to Rome, where he employed himself chiefly in delineating ancient ruins, and particularly studied effects of light and shade, in which he became an adept. He was the first painter who made practical use of the camera lucida. On returning home he devoted his powers to views in his native city, which he painted with a clear and firm touch and the most facile mastery of colour in a deep tone, introducing groups of figures with much effect. In his latter days he resided some time in England. His pictures, in their particular range, still remain unrivalled. He died on 20th August 1768. Bellotto (commonly named Bernardo) Canaletto, 1724-1780, was his nephew and pupil, and painted with deceptive resemblance to the style of the more celebrated master.
