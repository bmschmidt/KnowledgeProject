CALATAYUD, a town of Spain, in the province of Saragossa in Aragon, 45 miles S.W. of the city of that name, in 41° 24' N. lat., 1° 35' W. long. It stands on the left bank of the River Jalon, near its confluence with the Jiloca, partly on the plain and partly on a rocky slope, which is covered with remains of ancient Moorish fortifications. It is generally spacious and well built, and contains several squares, the largest of which is used as the marketplace, numerous convents, three hospitals, a fort, a provincial and municipal hall, an episcopal palace, a college, barracks, a theatre, and a bull-arena; there are also two collegiatos, or collegiate churches, both of them handsome edifices, and eleven other parish churches. The principal articles of manufacture are coarse brown paper, leather, and woollen stuffs. The soil of the neighbourhood is fertile and well cultivated. Calatayud is a Moorish city, and receives its name (Job’s Castle) from Job the nephew of Musa; but it stands near the site of the ancient Bilbilis, the birthplace of the poet Martial, and was for the most part built out of its ruins. Population, 9830.
