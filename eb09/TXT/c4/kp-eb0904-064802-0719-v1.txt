CAJAZZO, or Caiazzo, a town of Italy, in the province of Terra di Lavoro, and district of Piedimonte, situated on a height on the north bank of the Volturno, about 11 miles from Capua. It possesses a fine cathedral, and is defended by a castle of Lombard origin; but is principally interesting for the ruins of the Roman Calatia, which are still found in the town and neighbourhood. These consist chiefly of remains of the outer walls, and a cistern, which still affords a good supply of water. Various inscriptions are also extant, and the inhabitants point out a tomb which they maintain to be that of A. Atilius Calatinus. Calatia was originally a Samnite town, and is frequently mentioned in the earlier wars of the Romans. At a later date it became a municipal city of some importance, but makes no appearance in history. The population of the present town is 5892.
