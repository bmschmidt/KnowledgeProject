CAJETAN, Cardinal (1469-1534), was born at Cajeta in the kingdom of Naples in 1469. His proper name was Thomas de Vio, but he adopted that of Cajetan from his birthplace. He entered the order of the Dominicans at the age of sixteen, was for some time professor of divinity, and in 1508 became general of the order. For his zeal in defending the Papal pretensions, in a work entitled Of the Power of the Pope, he obtained the bishopric of Cajeta. He was afterwards raised to the archiépiscopal see of Palermo, and in 1517 was made a cardinal by Leo X. The year following he went as legate into Germany, to quiet the commotions raised by Luther against indulgences; but the Reformer, under protection of Frederick elector of Saxony, set him at defiance; for though he obeyed the cardinal’s summons in repairing to Augsburg, yet he rendered all his proceedings ineffectual. Cajetan was employed in several other negotiations and transactions, being as able in business as in letters. He died in 1534. He wrote commentaries upon portions of Aristotle, and upon the Summa of Aquinas, and made a careful translation of the Old and New Testaments, excepting Solomon’s Song, the Prophets, and the Revelation of St John.
