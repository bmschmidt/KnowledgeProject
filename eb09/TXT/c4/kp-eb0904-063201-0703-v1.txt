CAeRE (Kaîpe), called by the Greeks Agylla (*Aγυλλα), which is probably an Etruscan name, a city of Southern Etruria, near the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Its site is occupied by the modem Cervetri (Caere υetuβ), situated in the district of Civita Vecchia, about 32 miles from Rome. In the Virgilian legend of Aeneas, Caere appears as the seat of the Etruscan king Mezentius; but the earliest fact in its genuine annals is its participation in an attack on the city of Alalia in Corsica. It afforded a refuge to the Tarquins on their expulsion from Rome, and it was afterwards chosen by the Romans as the securest hiding-place of their treasures during the Gallic occupation of their city. In the time of Strabo the city had become of little importance, and was even outgrown by the neighbouring village of Aqua-Coeretanoe. It continued, however, to rank as a municipium, and in the 4th century of the Christian era had a “bishop” of its own; but in 1250 it was deserted by a large part of its inhabitants, who removed to what is now the village of Ceri. The chief building of modern date in Cervetri is the castle of the Ruspoli family, who are in possession of the seigniory. From the inhabitants being admitted to the privilege of Roman citizenship, but without the right of suffrage, the “Caerite franchise” came to be a proverbial expression denoting disfranchisement. A large number of interesting Etruscan remains have been found in the tombs of Caere, among which may be specially mentioned 'paintings of high antiquity and inscriptions showing one of the sepulchres to have belonged to the Tarquin or Tarchnas family.
