CALYPSO, in Grecian mythology, was a daughter of Oceanus and Tethys, or of Nereus, or of Atlas, and reigned in the mythical island of Ogygia. When Ulysses was shipwrecked on her shores, Calypso entertained the hero with great hospitality; and by the united influence of her love and spells, she prevailed on him to remain and share her honours. In this manner seven years had been spent, when Ulysses was seized with an irresistible desire to revisit his native country. Calypso tried every expedient, and even the promise of eternal youth, to induce the hero to remain; and when all her efforts had proved unavailing, and he set sail, grief at his departure occasioned her death. (Hesiod, Theog. 359; Hom., Od. i. 50, v. 28, vii. 254; Apollod. i. 2, ยง 7.)
