CALLISTRATUS, an Athenian poet, whose works have nearly all perished. He is now only known as the author of the hymn in honour of Harmodius and Aristogiton, who fell in their attempt to put down the dynasty of the Pisistratidae at Athens. This ode, which is contained in Athenaeus, has been beautifully translated by Thomas Moore.
