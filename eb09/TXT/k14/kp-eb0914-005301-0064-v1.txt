KÉSMÁRK, or Käsmark, an ancient town in the cis-Tisian county of Szepes (Zips), Hungary, is situated on the Poprâd, 11 miles north-west of Löcse (Leutschau), in 49° 8' N. lat., 20° 28' E. long. The trade is chiefly in linen, wine, and cereals. Owing to the vicinity of the Carpathians the rainfall is high, and the climate frequently tempestuous and inclement. At the end of 1880 the population amounted to 4477, chiefly Germans and Slovaks.

Késmárk (Latin Forum Caseorum) is probably aMagyarized form of the German Käsemarkt. In 1380, during the reign of Louis I., it was raised to the dignity of a royal free town. As the most important of the Saxon settlements in the north of Hungary, Késmárk in 1440 became the seat of the counts of Szepes (Zips). In 1464 King Matthias Corvinus granted the town the so-called jus gladii, its civic blazon, and the right of holding weekly markets. In 1530 Késmark fell into the power of John Zapolya, an l later it suffered much at the hands of the Polish leader Hieronymus Lasky, and from Sebastian Tököli. In 1655 the town was re-established by the emperor Ferdinand III. in all its ancient rights; and it remained a royal free town until the recent administrative changes of 1876. An international exhibition of linen goods was held at Késmark in the summer of 1881.
