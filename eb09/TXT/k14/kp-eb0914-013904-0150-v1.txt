KÖPENICK, or Cöpnick, a tçwn in the circle of Teltow in the government district of Potsdam, Prussia, is situated on an island at the influx of the Dahme into the Spree, [9:14:140] 8 miles 8.E. of Berlin. Two bridges connect it with the mainland. It has a royal palace, with a ritter-saal and a chapel, and a normal school (in the palace). Silkweaving, calico-printing, iron rolling, and the manufacture of sugar, shoddy, glass, chemicals, gold-leaf, <fcc., are the chief industries. There are also steam saw-mills, and some little shipping. Köpenick was the residence of the heathen prince Jaczo, and later of the electors of Brandenburg. It was at Köpenick that Frederick the Great was tried by court martial, when crown-prince. The population in 1875 was 7113.
