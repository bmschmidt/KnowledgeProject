KHOI, a town and district in the province of Azerbijan, Persia, towards the extreme north-west frontier, between Lake Urumiyah and the river Aras. The town lies in 38° 37' N. lat., 45° 15' E. long., 77 miles north-west of Tabriz on the great trade route between the Euxine and Persia, and on the Kotura, a tributary of the Aras, crossed here by a seven-arched bridge. The fortifications, which are in a ruinous state, consist of an outer line of bastions, redans, glacis, ditch and covered way, and an inner high wall flanked with towers, the intervening space being occupied with gardens and mud hovels. But the central part forms one of the best laid out towns in Persia, cool streams and lines of willows running along its broad regular streets. Here are a few good buildings, including the governor’s palace, several mosques, a large brick bazaar second only to those of Shiraz, and a fine caravanserai. There is a large transit trade, and considerable local traffic across the Turkish border. Ophthalmia is very prevalent, about 10 per cent, of the inhabitants suffering from inflammation of the eyes. The chief manufactures are copper wares and worsted socks. Here the Turks under Selim I. gained a great victory over the Persians in 1514, but with such heavy losses to themselves that the battle was long after known as the “day of doom.” In September 1881 Khoi was visited by a series of violent earthquakes, the seismic waves running north-west and southeast in the direction of the main mountain ranges. The population numbers about 30,000, including many Armenians, who occupy a separate quarter. The district consists of an elevated plateau 60 miles by 10 to 15, highly cultivated by a skilful system of drainage and irrigation, producing a series of fertile oases laid out in meadows, gardens, and tillage, and yielding rich crops of wheat and barley, besides apples, pears, cherries, walnuts, chestnuts, and unrivalled mulberries.
