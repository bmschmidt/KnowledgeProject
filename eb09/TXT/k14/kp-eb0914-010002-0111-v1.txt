KIRRIEMUIR, a burgh of barony and market-town of Forfarshire, Scotland, is beautifully situated on an eminence, above the glen through which the Gairie flows. It lies about 5 miles north-west of Forfar, and about 62 miles north of Edinburgh. The town, consisting of several narrow diverging streets, is tolerably well built. Its educational advantages are good; by the Henry bequest a number of boys are maintained at the public school; and by the Webster bequest a school has been endowed and erected. The special industry of the town is linen-weaving, for which large power-loom factories have recently been built. The population in 1881 was 6588.
