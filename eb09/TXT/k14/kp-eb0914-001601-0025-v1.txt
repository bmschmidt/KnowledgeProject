KAUFBEUREN, an ancient town in the government district of Swabia and Neuburg, Bavaria, is situated on the Wertach, about 55 miles south-west of Munich by rail. The chief industry is cotton spinning and weaving, and there is a tolerably active trade in cotton-stuffs and cheese. The population in 1875 was 5553.

Kaufbeuren is said to have been built in 842, and to have become a free imperial city by purchase in 1286 or 1288. In 1803 it passed to Bavaria. It was formerly a resort of pilgrims; and Roman coins have been found in the vicinity.
