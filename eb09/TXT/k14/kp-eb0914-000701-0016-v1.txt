KÁRWÁR, or Carwar, the chief town and headquarters station of North Kânara district, Bombay, 50 miles southeast of Goa, 14° 50' N. lat., 74° 14' E. long. It was once an important place of commerce; the East India Company had a factory there in the year 1663. It is the only safe harbour all the year round between Bombay and Cochin. In the bay is a cluster of islets called the Oyster Rocks, on the largest of which is a lighthouse. There are two smaller islands in the bay, which afford good shelter to native craft and small vessels during the strong north-west winds that prevail from February to April. The average annual value of the imports at Kârwâr port during the five years ending 1873-74 was £244,469, of the exports £310,884. Population in 1872, 13,263.
