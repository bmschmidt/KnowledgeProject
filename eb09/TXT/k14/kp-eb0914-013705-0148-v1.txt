KOLOMEA, or Kolomyia, a town and district in the Austrian province of Galicia, lies on the right bank of the Pruth and on the railway from Czernowitz to Lemberg, [9:14:138] about 105 miles south-south-east of the latter, in 48° 31' N, lat., 25° Γ E. long. Kolomea is the seat of the administrative, military, and judicial authorities of the district, and has Roman Catholic churches, synagogues, a lower gymnasium, and manufactories of earthenware. More than a third of the inhabitants are Jews, who carry on the greater part both of the wholesale and retail trade. The Ruthenian or native population of the town and neighbourhood are mostly employed in agricultural pursuits, and in the pasturing of horses, oxen, and sheep. In 1881 the population amounted to 23,109.
