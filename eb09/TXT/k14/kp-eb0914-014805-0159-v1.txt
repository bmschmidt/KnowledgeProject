It has a local court, three churches, a synagogue, steam saw-mills, and a steam brewery, and carries on trade in grain and seeds. The neighbouring castle of Krotoschin is the chief place of a mediatized principality of the prince of Thurn and Taxis, which was formed in 1819. The population of Krotoschin in 1875 was 8034.
