KEFF, more correctly El-Keff (El Kaf), a town of the regency of Tunis, about 95 miles south-west from the capital, and 75 miles south-east of Bone in Algeria, “on the western declivities of a rocky range of bold hills,” 5 or 6 miles to the east of the course of the Wady Medjardak. It is considered the third in importance of the Tunisian towns, ranking after Tunis and Kairwân; and, though distant some twenty-two miles from the Algerian frontier, it is practically a frontier post, and its walls and citadel are kept in a state of defence. Keff is identified with the ancient Roman colony of Sicca Veneria, which appears from the character of its Venus worship (Vai. Max., ii. 6, §15) to have been a Phoenician settlement. Remains of ancient buildings (as, for example, of a temple of Hercules), and a considerable number of ancient Latin inscriptions tend to confirm the identification. Population about 12,000.
