KIELCE, the chief town of a government in Russian Poland, is situated about 50 miles north-east of Cracow, in the mountainous district of the Lysa Gora. The copper-mines which were in the 16th century the main support of the place are no longer worked; but it has iron-works and sugar factories of considerable importance. The principal buildings are the cathedral, the bishopâ€™s palace, and a nunnery in which is an ancient statue of St Barbara fashioned out of a single piece of galena. In 1873 the population was 7838. Bishop Gedcow of Cracow is said to have founded Kielce in 1173.
