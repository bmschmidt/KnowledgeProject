KELLS, a market and municipal town of Meath county, Ireland, is situated on the Blackwater and on the Dublin and Meath Railway, 39 miles north-west of Dublin. The prosperity of the town depends chiefly upon its interesting antiquarian remains. The most notable is St Columbaâ€™s house, originally an oratory, but afterwards converted into a church, the chancel of which was in existence in 1752. The present church is modern, with the exception of the bell-tower, rebuilt in 1578. Near the church there is a very perfect specimen of the ancient round tower, and there are also several ancient crosses, one being situated in the market-place.

Kells was originally a royal residence, whence its ancient name Ceanannus, meaning the dun or circular northern fort, in which the king resided, and the intermediate name Kenlis, meaning head fort. The other places in Ireland named Kells are probably derived from Cealla, signifying church. In the 6th century Kells, it is said, was granted to St Columba. The statement that he founded a monastery at it is probably incorrect; at any rate the town owes its ecclesiastical importance to the bishopric founded about 807, and united to Meath in the 13th century. Until the Act of Union Kells returned two members to parliament. Population of urban sanitary district in 1881, 2820.
