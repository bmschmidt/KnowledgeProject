KLADNO, a mining town in the district of Smichov, Bohemia, lies about 15 miles west-north-west of Prague, with which it is connected by the Buschtierad line of railway. There are few buildings of special interest, and the importance of the town is mainly due to the wealth of its iron-mines and coal-fields, which afford employment for some three thousand men. The average annual yield of iron is from 25,000 to 30,000 tons, and of coal 300,000 tons. About 2 miles to the north is the imperial chateau of Buschtierad. Population in 1880, 14,085.
