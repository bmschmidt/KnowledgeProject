KOPRILI, Kiuprili, or Kjöprülü, a town in the vilayet of Prisrend, Macedonia, Turkey, is situated on both sides of the Vardar, the ancient Axius. Its Christian iuhabitants call it Velesa, probably a corruption of Byla-zora, described by Polybius as the chief city ⅛f Paeonia. Owing to the position of the town on sloping hills, the streets are steep; there are, however, numerous well-built houses. A wooden bridge crosses the river at this point. Mulberry trees and maize are grown in the neighbourhood. The population of Koprili, which has given its name to a celebrated family of viziers, is about 15,000.
