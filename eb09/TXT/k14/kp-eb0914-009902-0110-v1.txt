KIRKINTILLOCH, a burgh of barony and markettown of Dumbartonshire, Scotland, about 7 miles north of Glasgow. The town is rather irregularly built. The cruciform parish church dates from 1644. The Broomhill house for incurables is situated near the town. Traces of the wall of Antoninus are to be discerned behind the church. The inhabitants are chiefly employed in the chemical and iron-works on the banks of the Forth and Clyde Canal, and in coal-mining, which is being rapidly developed in the district. Weaving to a small extent is also carried on. Kirkintilloch became a burgh of barony by grant of William the Lion. Since 1871 it has been under the General Police Act of 1862. The population in 1881 was 10,582.
