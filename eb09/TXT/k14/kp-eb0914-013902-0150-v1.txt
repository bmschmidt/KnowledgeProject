KONITZ, or KÃ¶nitz, a town of the German empire, in the Marienwerder district of the province of West Prussia, situated near the railway, about 68 miles south-west of Dantzic. It was the first fortified post established in Prussia by Balk, the grand master of the Teutonic Order, and it continued for a long time to be a place of military importance. Wool and iron are the chief objects of the local industry. The inhabitants numbered 8046 in 1875; about 3000 are Roman Catholics and 550 Jews. There is a history of the town by Uppenkamp (Konitz, 1873).
