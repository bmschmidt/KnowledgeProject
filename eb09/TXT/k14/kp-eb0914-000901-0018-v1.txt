A considerable trade is carried on in the despatch of grain to St Petersburg. The chief buildings are the cathedral and three monastic establishments. Kashin, first mentioned about 1238, was in the 14th century a separate principality which contended with Tver for pre-eminence in the region. There are still some remains of the defences erected in 1661. Population, according to St Petersburg Calendar for 1874, 7346.
