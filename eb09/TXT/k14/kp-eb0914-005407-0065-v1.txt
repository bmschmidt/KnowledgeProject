KEUNTHAL, a petty hill state in the Punjab, India, between 30° 55'30" and 31° 6' N. lat., and 77° 10' and 77° 26' E. long., with an area of 116 square miles, and an estimated population of 50,000. The chief, a Rajput, [9:14:55] received the title of râjâ in 1857. After the Gurkha war, a portion of Keunthâl, which had been occupied by the Gurkhâs, was sold to the mahârâjâ of Patiâla, the remainder being restored to its own chief. In consideration of this, no tribute is paid by the Keunthâl râjà. In 1823 the district of Punâr was added to the Keunthâl state. The râjâ exercises rights of lordship over the petty states of Kothi, Theog, Madhan, and Ratesh.
