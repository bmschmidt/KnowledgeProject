KOLOMNA, a district town of Russia, in the government of Ryazan, situated on the railway between Moscow and Ryazan, 67 miles south-east of Moscow, at the confluence of the Moskva river with the Kolomenka. It is an old town mentioned in annals in 1177, and until the 14th century the capital of the Ryazan principality. It suffered greatly from the invasions of the Tartars, who destroyed it four times, as well as from the wars of the 17th century; but it always recovered, and never has lost its commercial importance. During this century it became a centre of manufactures of silks, cottons, and leather; there are also several smaller manufactures. The merchants of Kolomna carry on an active trade in cattle brought from southern provinces, and in grain, cattle, tallow, skins, salt, and timber purchased in the governments of Ryazan and Tula, and sent to Moscow, either by rail, or by boat down the Moskva river. Population 19,000.
