KÜSTRIN, or Cüstrin, a town and fortress of the first rank in the circle of Königsberg-in-der-Neumark, in the government district of Frankfort, Prussia, is situated at the confluence of the Oder and Warthe, about 51 miles northeast of Berlin by rail. It consists of the town proper within the strong fortifications, a suburb on the left bank of the Oder, and one on the right bank of the Warthe. There are bridges over both rivers. Kiistrin carries on several minor manufactures, and there is some shipping in the rivers. The population in 1875 (including the garrison) was 11,227.

About 1250 a town was erected on the site of Kiistrin, where a fishing village originally stood. From 1535 till 1571 it was the residence of the margrave of Brandenburg-Kiistrin, who died without heirs. Kiistrin was the prison of Frederick the Great when crown-prince, and the scene of the execution of his friend Katte.
