KÖSLIN, or Cöslin, chief town of a circle and government district in the province of Pomerania, Prussia, is situated at the foot of the Gollenberg, 5 miles from the Baltic coast, and about 86 miles north-east of Stettin (105 by rail). It is regularly built, and is the seat of a local court. In the large market-place is the statue of Frederick William L, erected in 1824. The industries include the manufacture of soap, tobacco, iron, paper, bricks and tiles, beer, and other goods. Population in 1875, 14,814.

Köslin was built in 1188 by the Saxons, and made a town in 1266. In 1532 it embraced the Reformation. It was severely tried in the Thirty Years’ War, and in the Seven Years’ War. In 1720 it was burned. On the Gollenberg stands a monument to the memory of the Pomeranians who fell in the war of 1813-15. The town formerly possessed a mint of its own.
