KIMBERLEY, formerly called New Rush, one of the mining towns of the diamond district of South Africa, situated in Griqualand West, to the east of the Orange river, 520 miles north-east of Cape Town. Though it dates only from 1872, and has much of the temporary character to be expected from the conditions that gave it existence, it bids fair to be a permanent settlement, having a number of buildings of stone and brick, a market place, banks, churches, &c., and publishing a Diamond News. Although in 1874 the population left almost en masse for the goldmines of Leydenberg (in Transvaal), the town was estimated in 1881 to have something like 10,000 inhabitants, besides a floating native population about equal in number. See Holub, Seven Years in South Africa, 1881.
