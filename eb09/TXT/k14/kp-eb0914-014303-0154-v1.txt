KOSLOFF, or Kozlov, a town in the government of Tamboff, Russia, on the railway between Ryajsk and Saratoff, 45 miles west of Tamboff, on the Lesnoy Voronezh river. It had its origin in a small monastery, which was founded in the forest in 1627; nine years later, an earthwork was raised close by, for the protection of the Russian frontier against the Tartars. Situated in a very-fertile country, on the highway to Astrakhan and at the head of the water communication with the Don, the town soon became a centre for the trade with these countries; as the junction of the railways leading to the Sea of Azoff, to Tsaritsin on the lower Volga, to Saratoff, and to Orel, its importance has recently been still further increased. Large transactions in grain, and also in horses and tallow, are effected in the rich agricultural district of Kosloff, as well as in those of Lipetsk and Borisoglebsk, for the Moscow market, or for western Europe, via Orel; manufactured wares are imported for the supply of the neighbouring districts. There are also in the town and district several tallow-melting houses, one manufactory of woollen cloth, and several distilleries. The town is built of wood, and its unpaved streets are dirty. Population, 27,000.
