KARA-HISSAR is the name of several towns in Asiatic Turkey. (1) Afium Kara Hiss ar has been already noticed, vol. i. p. 244. (2) Esκι Kara Hissar, lies 10 miles to the north of Afium. It is identified with the ancient Synnada, which in the time of Pliny was the chief town of a considerable district. The quarries of Docimia, which furnished the famous Synnadic or Docimitic marble, are about 2J miles distant, and in the town numerous traces have been found of ancient sculpture in various stages of execution (see Hamilton’s Asia Minor, i. 461, ii. 177; and Texier, Asie Mineure). (f) The eastern Kara-Hissar, usually distinguished by the prefix Shabin li.e., “alum”), is situated in the vilayet of Siwas, about 70 miles east of Niksar, on a northern tributary of the Lycus. It is the seat of a mutasarrif or vice-governor, and on a hill to the east there is an old castle which must at one time have been of military importance. The population is estimated at 11,000, mainly Mohammedans, though Armenians also form an important element. The district is rich in mineral products—silver, lead, copper, and iron; but only the alum mines, yielding from 120 to 250 tons per annum, are worked. The remains of the citadel, the ruins of a Byzantine church, traces of Roman brickwork, ancient coins, and a few Greek and Latin inscriptions, all go to show that Kara-Hissar has passed through many vicissitudes. The old town was evidently built not at the foot but up the steep slope of the hill, tier above tier. In 1473 Kara-Hissar made voluntary submission to Sultan Mohammed II. A full description, with a plan of the town and neighbourhood, is given by Barth in Petermann’s Mittheilungen, Ergänzungsheft, 1860. See also Taylor’s “Journal,” &c., in Jourη. Roy. Geogr. Soc., 1868.
