KÖNIGINHOF (in Czech, Dvur Kralove), chief town of a department in the north-east of Bohemia, is situated on the left bank of the Elbe, about 80 miles north-east of Prague. In the tower of one of tho churches Hanka discovered the Königinhof MSS. in 1817 (see vol. xi. p. 440). The Zaboj monument in the market-place commemorates the discovery. Cotton-weaving, yarn-spinning, and brewing are the leading industries. In 1421 Königinhof was stormed by the Hussites. On June 29, 1866, it was the scene of a Prussian victory over the Austrians. The population in 1869 was 6222.
