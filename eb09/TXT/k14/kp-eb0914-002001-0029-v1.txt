KAZALA, or Kazalinsk, a fort and town, at the point where the Kazala falls into the Jaxartes, about 47 miles from its mouth. It is situated in 45° 45' N. lat. and 62° 7' E. long., “at the junction,” to quote Schuyler’s description, “of all the trade routes in Central Asia, as the road from Orenburg meets here with the Khivan, Bukharan, and Tashkent roads”; and thus, besides carrying on a lively local trade with the Kirghiz of the surrounding country, it is a point of growing importance in the general current of commerce. In other respects the position of the place is far from attractive: the floods on the river make it an island in the spring; in summer it is parched by the sun and hot winds, and hardly a tree can be got to grow. The streets are wide, but the houses, as well as the fairly strong fort known as Fort No. 1, are built of mud bricks. The population, stated’ at 5000, is on the increase.
