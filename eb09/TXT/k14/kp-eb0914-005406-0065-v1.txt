KEUNJHAR, or Keunjur, a petty state in Orissa, India, lying between 21° Γ and 22° 9' 30" N. lat., and 85° 14' and 86° 24' 35" E. long, with an area of 3096 square miles, and a population in 1872 of 181,871. The state originally formed part of Morbhanj; but about two hundred years ago the tribes of this part, finding it a great hardship to travel through the perilous forests of Morbhanj to obtain justice from their prince, separated themselves, and set up the brother of the Morbhanj râjâ as their independent ruler. The last prince rendered good service during the Koi rebellion in 1857, and was rewarded with the title mahârâjâ. A Government elephant establishment is maintained at Keunjhar.
