KHOTIN, or Khoteen (thia is the Russian form of the name, which appears in a great variety of disguises—partly dialectal—such as Khotchim, Chotchim, Choczim, and Chocim), a fortified town of 21,000 inhabitants, in the government of Bessarabia, Russia, situated in 48° 30' N. lat. and 26° 30' E. long., on the right bank of the Dniester, near the Austrian (Galician) frontier, and opposite Podolian Kamenetz. Though it possesses a few manufactures and carries on a considerable trade both legitimate and contraband, Khotin has all through its history been of importance mainly as a military post In the Middle Ages it was the seat of a Genoese colony; and it has passed through periods of Polish, Turkish, and Austrian possession. The chief facts in its annals as a fortress are the defeat of the Turks in 1621 by Ladislaus IV., in 1673 by John Sobieski, and in 1739 by the Russians uuder Miinnich; the defeat of the Russians by the Turks in 1768; the capture by the Russians in 1769; and the occupation by the Russians in 1806. It finally passed to Russia along with Bessarabia in 1812 by the peace of Bucharest.
