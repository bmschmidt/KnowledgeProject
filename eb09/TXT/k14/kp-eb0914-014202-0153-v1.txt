KOROTOYAK, a town of Russia, in the government of Voronezh, on the right bank of the Don, 6 miles from the Davydovka railway station, and 47 miles south of Voronezh. It was founded in 1642 by emigrants from interior provinces of Russia, and had a small wooden fort. Owing to the proximity of Ostrogojsk, which is a trading place of some importance, its trade is insignificant, and its 9000 inhabitants live by agriculture and some trade in grain.
