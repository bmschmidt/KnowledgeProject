KARAULI, or Kerowly, a native state in Râjputana, India, lying between 26° 3' and 26° 49' N. lat., and between 76° 35' and 77° 26' E. long. It is entirely surrounded by neighbouring states, and has an area of about 1260 miles, and an estimated population of 140,000. Almost the entire territory is composed of hills and broken ground, but there are no lofty peaks, the highest having an elevation of less than 1400 feet above sea-level. The Chambal river flows along the south-east boundary of the state. Iron ore and building stone comprise the mineral resources of Karauli. The prevailing agricultural products are bâfra and jodr, which form the staple food of the people. The only manufactures consist of a little weaving, dyeing, wood-turning, and stone-cutting. The principal imports are piece goods, salt, sugar, cotton, buffaloes, and bullocks; the exports rice and goats. The Brâhmans form the most numerous class of the population. The Minas, who come next, make up the bulk of the cultivating class. The Râjputs, although numerically few, constitute the most important section. These belong almost entirely to the Jadu clan; they make good soldiers, but are indifferent agriculturists. The feudal aristocracy of the state consists entirely of Jadu thakwrs connected with the ruling house. They pay a tribute in lieu of constant military service, but in case of emergency or on occasions of state display they are bound to attend on the chief with their retainers. The mahârâjâ is the head of the clan, which claims descent from Krishna.

Karauli, or Kerowly, the capital of the above state, is situated in 26° 30' N. lat. and 77° 4' E. long. The town, which is fortified, is surrounded by a wall of sandstone, and is also protected on the north and east bv deep [9:14:5] winding ravines. The streets are narrow and irregular, and almost impassable for wheeled conveyances; there are, however, many costly houses and handsome temples, the sole building material being sandstone. The population is estimated at 28,000.
