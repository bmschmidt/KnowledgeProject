KARCZAG, or Kardszag, a corporate town υf Hungary, and formerly the capital of the district of Great Cumania (now included in the county of Jâsz-Nagy-Kun-Szolnok), lies about 88 miles east-south-east of Budapest, with which city it is connected by railway, in 47° 19' N. lat., 20° 56' E. long. Karczag is a large straggling town, and contains Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Protestant churches, royal and magisterial courts of law, and tax and post offices. The soil of the surrounding country is exceedingly humid and fertile, and enormous quantities of melons, fruit, grapes, wheat, maize, rape-seed, and mangcorn are grown. In the more marshy places water-fowl and tortoises are caught in large numbers. Population in 1880, 15,962, almost exclusively Magyars.
