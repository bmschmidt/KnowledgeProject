KOBRIN, a town of Russia, in the government of Grodno, 12 miles east of Brest-Litovsk and 4 miles from the Tevli station of the railway between Minsk and Brest-Litovsk. It lies in the midst of a marshy country, to the east of which are extensive forests; although situated on the Mukhavetz river, which enters into the system of canals uniting the Dnieper and Bug, it enjoys but little prosperity. Its 8000 inhabitants are chiefly engaged in agriculture; there is also some trade in grain, salt, timber, and bones. Kobrin was until the 16th century the capital of a principality of the same name.
