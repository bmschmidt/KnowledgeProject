KHORAMABAD, a town and fortress of Persia, capital of the province of Luristan, in 33° 32' N. lat., 47° 43' E. long., 138 miles west-north-west of Ispahan, 117 south-east of Kirmânshàhàn. The fort is perched on an Isolated steep rock in the middle of a difficult pass, and is 1000 yards in circuit. The modern town lies at the south-west foot of the fort in a narrow valley watered by the broad but shallow and rapid river Kashgan. A rich plain stretching thence southwards yields abundance of supplies. Population about 6000.
