KÁSIMBÁZÁR, or Cossimbazar, a decayed town in Murshidâbâd district, Bengal, 24° 7' 40" N. lat., 88° 19' E. long. Long before the days of Murshid Kuli Khân, who founded and gave his name to the city of Murshidàbâd, the trade of Bengal was centred at Kâsimbâzâr. The different European nations who traded to India had factories there from very early times. An English commercial agent was appointed to Kâsimbâzâr in 1658; and at the close of the century it had become the leading English commercial agency in Bengal. The decay of the town dates from the beginning of the present century, when its climate, which had previously been celebrated for its salubrity, underwent an unexplained change for the worse; and its ruin was completed in 1813 by a sudden change in the course of the Bhâgirathi, on which it stood. The site is now a swamp, marked by a few ruins.
