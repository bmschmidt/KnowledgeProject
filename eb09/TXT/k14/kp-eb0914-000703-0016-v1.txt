KASANLIK, or Kezanlyk, a town of Roumelia, in the vilayet of Adrianople, is situated at the foot of the Balkans, about 5 miles south of the Shipka Pass, in a highly fertile plain watered by the Tundja and its numerous tributaries. Throughout the plain there are extensive fields of roses grown for the manufacture of attar of roses, which is exported largely to western Europe. Maize is also grown; and cattle and sheep are reared in considerable numbers. The town is surrounded by valuable woods of walnut trees. The Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78 has done serious injury to the prosperity of the whole region, and has told on the production of attar of roses, which formerly was estimated at about 200 gallons for the Kasanlik district. The population is variously estimated at from 10,000 to 12,000. Two-thirds of these are Bulgarians and Christians; the remainder are Turks.
