KELSO, a burgh of barony and market-town of Roxburghshire, Scotland, is situated on the north side of the Tweed near its junction with the Teviot, 45 miles south-east of Edinburgh and 23 south-west of Berwick by rail. The town is embosomed among woods in a pleasantly undulating and fine agricultural country. The principal streets branch out in four directions from the spacious square, where are the principal shops and hotels. From.the bridge of fi,ve arches, designed by Rennie, a fine view is obtained of the course of the river. Near it stand the picturesque ruins of the ancient abbey church, founded by David I., but demolished by the English in 1545, one of the finest extant examples in Scotland of the Early Norman style. A mile west of Kelso, on the north bank of the river, is Floors Castle, the seat of the duke of Roxburghe, nearly opposite which, on the south bank, stand the ruins of the old fortress of Roxburgh Castle. Kelso possesses a town-hall, a corn exchange, an auction mart, and a collegiate school. About a mile north of the town there is a race course; the fine cemetery and the spacious public park also deserve mention. The trade of the town is chiefly connected with agriculture. There are large nurseries, corn-mills, manure works, coach works, a foundry, and two engineering shops. Kelso was made a burgh of barony in 1634. It is now under the General Public Act. The population in 1881 was 4563.
