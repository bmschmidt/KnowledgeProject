KUTAIAH, Kutaya, or Kiutahia, the chief town of a sandjak in the vilayet of Khudavendikiar, Asia Minor, is situated on the Pursak, an affluent of the Sakafia, the ancient Sangarius. The town lies at an important point of the great road across Asia Minor from Constantinople to Aleppo. It has a busy trade, and a population variously estimated at from 40,000 to 60,000. Kutaiah has been identified with Cotiaeum.
