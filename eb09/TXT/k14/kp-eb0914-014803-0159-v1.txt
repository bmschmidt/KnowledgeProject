KRISHNAGAR, town and headquarters of Nadiyâ district, Bengal, India, situated on the left bank of the Jalangi river, 23° 23' N. lat., 88° 32' E. long. The municipal limits comprise an area of 7 square miles and a population in 1872 of 26,750 persons—Hindus, 18,114; Mohammedans, 8076; Christians, 560. Besides the usual Government offices and courts, Krishnagar is also a station of the Church Missionary Society and of a Roman Catholic mission, each body having its own church and schools.
