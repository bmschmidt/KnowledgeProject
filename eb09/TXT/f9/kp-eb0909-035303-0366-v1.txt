FOGGIA, a city of Italy, capital of the province of Capitanata, situated near the centre of the great plain of Apulia, 122 miles by rail E.N.E. of Naples. It is well built, and the main streets are wide and clean. The principal church, originally a stately Norman edifice, was almost destroyed by an earthquake in 1731, and the upper part has been rebuilt in a different style, which greatly injures the effect. There are numerous other churches, a fortified palace now in ruins, a large theatre, a customhouse, an orphanage, a college for daughters of the nobility, a public library, an agricultural society, an economical society, an ornithological museum, and an Artesian well. The town has now become a great railway junction, just as it was formerly the meeting place of the principal roads of the country. It is a staple market for corn and wool, and one of the largest fairs of southern Italy is held there in May. The corn magazines or fosse are very extensive, consisting of vaults lined with masonry under the principal streets and squares. Other articles of export are capers, wine, and oil. The flocks of sheep that descend annually in autumn from the mountains of Abruzzo into the plains of Apulia pay a toll as they pass through the city. The population in 1872 was 34,181.

Foggia was probably founded in the 9th century, and it is supposed that it occupied the site of the ancient Arpi or Argyripa, and derives its name from the foveae or pits that were dug among the ruins. It was a favourite residence of Frederick IL, who in 1240 held a parliament within its walls; and there he lost his third wife, Isabella, daughter of King John of England. In 1254 Manfred, the natural son ofâ€™ Frederick, defeated the forces of Pope Innocent IV. outside the city, which was not long afterwards laid in ruins by Charles of Anjou. Ferdinand I. summoned his barons and prelates to Foggia to prepare a crusade against the Turks.
