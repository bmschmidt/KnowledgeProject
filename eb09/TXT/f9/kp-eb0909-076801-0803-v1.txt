FRENCH, Nicholas (1604-1678), an Irish political pamphleteer, was born in Wexford in 1604. After receiving ordination at Louvain, he became Roman Catholic priest at Wexford, and in 1643 he was appointed bishop of Ferns. Having taken a prominent part in the political disturbances of this period, he deemed it prudent, after the universal submission which followed the storming of λVex-ford by Oliver Cromwell, to retire to Brussels, where, in 1652, he published his attack on Ormond, entitled The Unkind Deserter of Loyal Men and True Friends, and shortly afterwards The Bleeding Iphigenia. The most important of his other pamphlets is the Sale and Settlement of Ireland. Shortly before his death, which took place August 23, 1678, he was nominated coadjutor-archbishop of Ghent. The Historical Works of Bishop French, comprising the pamphlets above named and several others, were published at London in 1846 in 2 vols., and a notice of him will be found in T. D. Μ‘Gee’s Irish Writers of the 17 th Century, London, 1846.
