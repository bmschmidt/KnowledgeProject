FREMONT, a city of the United States of America, capital of Sandusky, county Ohio, is situated on the Sandusky river at the head of navigation, 30 miles east of [9:9:768] Toledo by rail. Steamers ply between the city and the principal ports of Lake Erie, and it has manufactories of woollens, sashes, and blinds, flour mills, and engineering works. The late Mr Burchard bequeathed to the city land for two public parks, and $50,000 for a public library, the building for which is to be erected on the Fort Stephenson property, the scene of the gallant and successful defence of General Crogher against a superior force of the British and Indians, August 1st and 2d, 1813. The population of Fremont in 1870 was 5455.
