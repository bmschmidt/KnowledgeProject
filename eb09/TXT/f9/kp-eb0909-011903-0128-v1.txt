FEUCHTERSLEBEN, Eduard, Freiherr von (1806- 1849), an Austrian physician, philosopher, and poet, was born at Vienna on the 29th April 1806. He entered the university of Vienna in 1825, and obtained his doctor’s degree in 1833. In 1845 he became dean of the faculty of medicine, and in 1847 was named vice-director of medico-chirurgical studies. In July 1848 he was appointed under secretary of state of the education department, but resigned his office in the same year, and died 3d September 1849.

His principal prose writings are Ueber das Hippokratische erste Buch von der Diätetik, Vienna, 1835; Ueber die Gewissheit und Wurde der Heilkunst, Vienna, 1835; Lehrbuch der ärztlichen Seelenkunde, Vienna, 1835, translated into English under the title Medical Physiology; and Zur Diätetik der Seele, Vienna, 1838. He obtained some reputation also as a poet. Some of his verses are lyrical, but most are of a didactic character. His collected works —with the exception of those purely medical—edited by the poet Hebbel, were published in 7 vols, at Vienna, 1851-53.
