FEDCHENKO, Alexis Paulowitch (1844-1873), a Russian naturalist and traveller, well known for his explorations in Central Asia. He was born at Irkutsk, in Siberia, on 7th February 1844; and, after attending the gymnasium of his native town, proceeded to the university of Moscow, for the study more especially of zoology and geology. In 1868 he travelled through Turkestan, the district of the lower Sir-Darya, and Samarcand; and shortly after his return he set out for Khokand, where he visited a large portion of territory till then unknown. Soon after his return to Europe he perished on Mount Blanc while engaged in an exploring tour in Switzerland, 15th September 1873.

Accounts of the explorations and discoveries of Fedchenko have been published by the Russian Government,—his Journeys in Turkestan in 1874, In the Khαnαt of Khokand in 1875, and Botanical Discoveries in 1876. See Petermann’s Mittheilungen, 1872-74.
