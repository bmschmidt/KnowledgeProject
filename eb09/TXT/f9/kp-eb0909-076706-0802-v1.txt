FRÉJUS, the ancient Forum Julii, a town of France, department of Var, about a mile from the Mediterranean, and 15 miles S.E. of Draguignan. It is the seat of a bishop, and has some handsome moαern buildings, among which are the cathedral and the episcopal palace, both of Gothic architecture, and constructed partly of the remains of Roman edifices. It possesses manufactures of cork and soap, and among the minerals of the neighbourhood are coal, pumice stone, porphyry, jasper, and amethyst. Fréjus took its name from Julius Caesar, who is said to have established a Roman colony there. It was improved by Augustus, and in the time of the subsequent emperors it became an important naval station. Among the remains of the ancient town are a triumphal arch, a ruined amphitheatre, traces of two moles which formed the entrance of the port, and portions of a fine aqueduct, which brought the waters of the Siagne into the town from a distance of 20 miles. Traces of the old walls of the town are also visible. The port, which communicated with the sea by means of a canal, has been dried up, and its site is now occupied by gardens. At St Raphael, a fishing village about a mile and a half distant, Napoleon disembarked on his return from Egypt in 1799, and re-embarked for Elba in 1814. The population of Fréjus in 1876 was 2791. See Texier, Mémoires sur la ville et le port de Fréjus, 1847.
