FLEETWOOD, William (1656-1723), a learned English bishop, was descended of an ancient family in Lancashire, and was born in the Tower of London, January 21, 1656. He received his education at Eton and at King’s College, Cambridge. About the time of the Revolution he entered into holy orders, and was shortly afterwards made rector of St Austin’s, London, and lecturer of St Dunstan’s in the West. He became canon of Windsor in 1702, and in 1706 he was nominated to the see of St Asaph, from which he was translated in 1714 to that of Ely. He died at Tottenham, Middlesex, on the 4th August 1723. Bishop Fleetwood was regarded as the best preacher of his time, and his character stood deservedly high in general estimation. In liberal and enlightened piety he was considerably in advance of his age.

His principal writings are— Essay on Miracles, 1701; Chronicum Preciosum, 1707; and Free Sermons, 1712, containing sermons on the death of Queen Mary, the duke of Gloucester, and King William. A collected edition of his works was published in 1737.
