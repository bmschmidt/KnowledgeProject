FERENTO, the remains of a city of Etruria whose ancient name was Ferentinum. They are situated on the northern slope of the Ciminian hills, about 5 miles from Viterbo, and the same distance from the banks of the Tiber. The ancient city was the birthplace of the emperor Otho, and possessed a very old and splendid temple of Fortune. In the 11th century the city was destroyed by the inhabitants of Viterbo, and it is now uninhabited. Various portions of its walls and gates are still extant, but the principal building of which the remains still exist is a theatre of very peculiar construction.
