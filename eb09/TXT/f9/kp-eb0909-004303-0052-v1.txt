FASANO, a town of Italy, in the circondario and province of Bari, 32 miles S. of Bari, and a little to the W. of the railway to Brindisi. It stands in a rich olive district, and has a good trade in the produce. During summer the plague of flies is such that the inhabitants retire to a hill in the neighbourhood, called La Selva, where there is already a considerable suburb growing up. The ancient Egnatia stood in this vicinity. Population 14,800.
