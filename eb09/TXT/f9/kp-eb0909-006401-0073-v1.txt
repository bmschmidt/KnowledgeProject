FEITAMA, Sybrand (1694-1758), a Dutch author, was born at Amsterdam, December 10, 1694. He was originally intended for the ministry, but eventually adopted a commercial career. In middle life, having made a sufficient fortune, he retired from business, and dedicated his remaining years to literature, and to a circle of friends that included all the most eminent of his younger contemporaries. In 1733 he published his translation of Telemaque, to which he had given twenty years of revision. In 1735 appeared two volumes of his Stage Poems, original dramas for reading rather than acting. In 1743 was issued the first draft of his translation of the IIenmade, in perfecting which he spent nearly a quarter of a century. Three volumes of his Posthumous Poems appeared in 1764. He died at Amsterdam on the 3d of June 1758. The influence of Feitama over Dutch literature was very extensive and very pernicious. He was a cold and rhetorical versifier, a learned trifler, and hopelessly wedded to the French tradition. His two great translations, which are indeed admirably performed from his own standpoint, have long outlived their immense popularity in the last century.
