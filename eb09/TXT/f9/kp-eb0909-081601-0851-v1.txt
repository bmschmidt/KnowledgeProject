FULLER’S EARTH (Germ. Walkererde, Fr. Terre à foulon, Argile smectique), so named from its use by fullers as an absorbent of the grease and oil of cloth, is an earthy hydrated silicate of aluminium, containing, according to one analysis, silica 53O, alumina 10, ferric oxide 9 ’ 75, magnesia 1 ’ 25, lime ’ 5, sodium chloride ’ 1, water 24 per cent., and a trace of potash. It has a specific gravity of l ’ 7-2 ’ 4, and a shining streak; is unctuous to the touch; is commonly greenish-brown or greenish-grey, sometimes bluish-grey, whitish, or red-brown in colour; adheres but slightly to the tongue; becomes translucent in water, and falls to powder; and before the blowpipe gives a porous slag, melting eventually to a white glass. Among the localities where fuller’s earth is found are Nutfield near Reigate in Surrey, Renton in Yorkshire, Quarry Wood in Morayshire, Rosswein in Saxony, and Zwikowetz in Bohemia. Fuller’s or “Walker’s” earth is [9:9:817] found between the Aymestry limestone and the underlying lower Ludlow beds, rendering the former particularly liable to slides or subsidences (see Murchison, Biluria). From the presence in it of beds of the mineral, a thick deposit of blue and yellow clays with bands of rubbly limestone in the Oolitic or Jurassic series of rocks in England has received the name of Fuller’s Earth (see Geology). The consumption of fuller’s earth has fallen off considerably, owing to the employment of other substances for the cleansing of cloth. It was in past times largely mined in the Downs, south of Bath, for use in the cloth-mills of Bradford-on-Avon, Frome, and Gloucestershire.
