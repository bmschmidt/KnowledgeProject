FRIEDLAND, a town of Bohemia, the chief town of a circle, is situated in the valley of the Wittich at the confluence of that river with the Rasnitz, 14 miles E. of Zittau. Besides the old town, which is still surrounded by walls, it contains three suburbs. The principal industry is the manufacture of woollen and linen cloth. Friedland is chiefly remarkable for its old castle, which occupies an imposing situation on a small hill commanding the town. The tower of this building was erected in 1014, and the whole structure was completed in 1551. It was several times besieged in the Thirty Years’ and Seven Years’ Wars. In 1622 it was purchased by Wallenstein, and his likeness, painted in 1626, is included in the list of portraits of former possessors of the castle which adorn its walls. The population in 1875 was 4482.
