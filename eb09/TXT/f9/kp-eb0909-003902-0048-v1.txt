FARO, a city and seaport of Portugal, chief town of the province of Algarve, is situated on the Rio Fermoso near its mouth, 20 miles W. by S. of Tavira. It is surrounded by walls, and contains a cathedral, a military hospital, a customhouse, an arsenal, and several convents and charitable establishments. At the eastern end of the town is an old castle surrounded by Moorish fortifications. The harbour is small, but it has a good roadstead. The exports are figs, raisins, almonds, dates, oranges, lemons, wines, cork, sumach, baskets, and anchovies. Faro was burned by the English in 1596, and was partly destroyed by an earthquake in 1755. The population is about 8000.
