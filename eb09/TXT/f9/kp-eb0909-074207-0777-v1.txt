FREDERICKSTAD, a fortified town of Norway, stift of Christiania, is situated at the mouth of the Glommen, 48 miles S.E. of Christiania. The principal buildings are the church, the town-hall, the arsenal, and the magazine. It has manufactures of hardware, pottery, and brandy, and a considerable shipping trade and commerce in wood. About a mile and a half distant is the fall of the Glommen known as Sarpfos. Frederickstad was founded by Frederick II. in 1567. It was for a long time strongly fortified, and in 1716 Charles XII. of Sweden made a vain attempt to capture it. The population in 1875 was 9562.
