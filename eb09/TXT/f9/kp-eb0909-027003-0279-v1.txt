FITCH, Ralph, a London merchant and one of the earliest English travellers in India, lived in the latter half of the 16th century. As he was engaged in a traffic in Eastern products it occurred to him that he might pursue a more profitable trade were he to visit the countries from which they came. Accordingly, along with other four merchants, he re-embarked in January 1583 in a ship called the “Tygre,” and set sail for Tripoli in Syria. From Tripoli they journeyed to Aleppo and through Mesopotamia to Baghdad, from whence they sailed down the Tigris to Bussorah. From Bussorah they sailed in small boats down the Persian Gulf to the island of Ormus. Here from the jealousy of the other European merchants at their success, they were apprehended by the governor of the castle as spies and sent to the Portuguese viceroy at Goa. They afterwards received their liberty on paying a fine, but fearing a second imprisonment they escaped secretly from Goa, and journeyed through the interior of India. Fitch ultimately left his companions, and after reaching Bengal he sailed in 1589 for Cochin, touching on his way at Ceylon. After sojourneying at Cochin eight months he re-embarked for Goa, and thence retraced his footsteps to Tripoli, finally reaching London on the 29th April 1591. The Voyage of Mr Ralph Fitch, Merchant of London, to Ormus and so to Goa, in the East India; to Cambaia, Ganges, Bengala; to Bacola and Chonderi; to Pegu, to Jamahay in the kingdom of Siam, and back to Pegu, and from thence to Malacca, Zeilan, Cochin, and all the Coast of the East Indies, is included in Pinkerton’s Collection of Travels.
