FOPPA, Vincenzo, a painter, was born in Brescia soon after 1400, and died there in 1492. He settled in Milan towards 1425, and was the lÎ¹ead of a school of painting which subsisted up to the advent of Leonardo da Vinci. His contemporary reputation was very considerable, his merit in perspective and foreshortening being recognized especially. Among his noted works are a fresco in the Brera Gallery, Milan, the Martyrdom of St Sebastian; a Crucifix in the Carrara Gallery, Bergamo, executed in 1455; the Trinity, in the church of S. Pietro in Oliveto, Brescia; and other paintings in the same city.
