FLORES, also called Endeh and Mangeraai, an island of the East Indian Archipelago belonging to the residency of Timor. It lies in a line with Java between Sumbava on the west and Timor on the east, and stretches from 8° 3' to 9° 59' S. lat., and from 119° 49' to 123° 1' E. long. It is about 230 miles long, and from 20 to 40 broad, and its area is estimated at about 8900 square miles. Like most of the islands of the archipelago, it is both mountainous and volcanic, among the loftier summits being 0mbuu Romba or Gunong Keo, 9054 feet in height; Lobetabi or, in a corrupted form, Lovotivo, 7115; 0mbuu Soro or Gunong Rokka, 6557; and Larantuka or Ilimandiri, 5180. The interior is very partially explored, though the forests are neither so dense nor so extensive as in Borneo or Celebes. Besides amber, which is found on the coast, the mineral products consist of sulphur, pumice-stone, copper, and a little iron and gold. Sandal-wood, rice, wild cinnamon, and birds’ nests are the most important articles of export, giving rise to a considerable trade with Celebes, Timor, Batavia, and Singapore. The inhabitants are mainly of Malay origin, and the language appears to be akin to that of Bima. There are considerable settlements of Buginese and Wadjorese. Portugal lays claim to certain portions of the island, but practically it is all under Dutch supremacy. Christianity has been introduced by the Portuguese on the east coast, and the converts are visited from time to time by priests from Timor.
