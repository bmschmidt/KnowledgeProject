FAWKES, Francis (1721-1777), a poet and translator, was a native of Yorkshire, and was born in the year 1721. After studying at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he graduated Μ. A., he entered into holy orders, and was successively curate of Bramham, curate of Croydon, vicar of Orpington, and rector of Hayes, and finally was made one of the chaplains to the princess of Wales. He published Bramham Parle, a Poem, in 1745; a volume of poems and translations in 1761; and Partridge Shooting, a Poem, in 1767. His translations of the minor Greek poets— Anacreon, Sappho, Bion and Moschus, Musaeus, Theocritus, and Apollonius—acquired for him considerable fame, but it may be safely predicted that when they are forgotten Fawkes will be remembered for his fine song, Dear Tom, this brown jug, that now foams with mild ale. He also edited a Family Bible with notes. He died on the 26th August 1777.
