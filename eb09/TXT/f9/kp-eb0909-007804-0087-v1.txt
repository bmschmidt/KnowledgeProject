FERDINAND II., king of Naples, grandson of the preceding, and son of Alphonso II., was born probably in 1468. Alphonso finding his tenure of the throne uncertain on account of the general dissatisfaction of his subjects, abdicated in his sonâ€™s favour in 1495, but notwithstanding this the treason of a party in Naples rendered it impossible to defend the city against the approach of Charles VIII. Ferdinand fled to Ischia; but when the French left Naples, the Neapolitans, irritated by their conduct during the occupation of the city, recalled him; and with the aid of the great general of Ferdinand V. of Spain, Gonzalo de Cordova, he was able completely to rid his state of its invaders shortly before his death on the 7th October 1496.
