FORCELLINI, Egidio (1688—1768), an Italian philologist, was born at Fener in the district of Treviso, and belonged to a very poor family. He went to the seminary at Padua in 1704, studied under Facciolati, and in due course attained to the priesthood. From 1724 to 1731 he held the office of rector of the seminary at Ceneda, and from 1731 to 1765 that of father confessor in the seminary of Padua. The remaining years of his life were mainly spent in his native village. He died at Padua in 1768 before the completion of the great work by which his name is preserved. This is a vast Latin Lexicon, usually referred to as Facciolati’s, which has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been published. He was engaged with his Herculean task for nearly 35 years, and the transcription of the manuscript by Luigi Violato occupied eight years more. It was ultimately published at the expense of Cardinal Priole, under the title of Totius Latinitatis Lexicon, consilio et cura Jacobi Facciolati, opera et studiis Aegidü Forcellini, Seminarii Patavini Alumni, lucubratum, 4 vols., Padua, 1771.
