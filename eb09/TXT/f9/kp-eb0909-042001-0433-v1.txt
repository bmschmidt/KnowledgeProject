FORT DE FRANCE, formerly Port Royal, the capital of the French island of Martinique, one of the smaller Antilles, is situated on the west coast of the island, on the north side of a well-sheltered bay. It is the residence of the governor, and possesses a court of justice and a chamber of commerce. The harbour, which is commanded by a fort, is good and safe, and connected with it there is a floating dock and a repairing dock. The town possesses sugar works, and its chief exports are sugar, coffee, and rum. Its trade will be considerably increased by the railway to St Pierre. During the war with France Port Royal was for a time the headquarters of the British West Indian fleet. The population of the town is about 11,500.
