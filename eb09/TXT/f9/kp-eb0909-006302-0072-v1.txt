FEE (feodum), in English law, signifies an eβtate of inheritance (i.e., an estate descendable to the heirs of the grantee so long as there are any in existence), as opposed to an estate for life. In a more primary sense it meane an estate by tenure (land holden of a lord) as opposed to land owned allodially. See Digby’s History of the Lavo of Real Property, p. 50, and the article Estate.
