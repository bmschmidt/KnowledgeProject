FLAVIAN, patriarch of Constantinople, succeeded Proclus in 447. He presided at the council which deposed Eutyches in 448, but in the following year he was deposed by the council of Alexandria, which reinstated Eutyches in his office. Not satisfied with the mere deposition of Flavian, his opponents were so carried away by their feelings as to proceed to personal violence, and his death soon after at Hypaepa in Lydia is attributed to a kick inflicted on him by Dioscorus, patriarch of Alexandria, the president of the council. The council of Chalcedon canonized him as a martyr, and he is also enrolled in the martyrology of the Latin Church, his day being the 18th February.
