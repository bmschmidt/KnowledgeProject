FRAUSTADT, a garrison town, and the chief town of a circle in the government district of Posen, Prussia, is situated in a flat sandy country 50 miles S.S.W. of Posen. It has an orphanage, a reformatory, a royal real-school of the first class, a higher ladies’ school, and an agricultural school. Its manufactures include woollen and cotton goods, hats, morocco leather, and gloves, and it has a considerable trade in corn, cattle, and wool. Fraustadt was founded by the Dutch, and until 1343 belonged to the principality of Glogau. Near the town the Swedish general Reenskiöld defeated the Saxons on the 13th of February 1706. The population in 1875 was 6435.
