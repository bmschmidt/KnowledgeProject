FALERNUS AGER, the name of a district in the northern part of Campania. The term has sometimes a wide and sometimes a restricted signification, being used with reference to the whole of the fertile plain between the Massican (now Mandragone) hills and the river Vulturnus, but more commonly as denoting that portion of the plain lying at the foot of the Massican hills between the rivers Vulturnus and Savo, and celebrated for its wines. In the time of Horace these were reputed to be the best of all Italy, but in the time of Pliny their reputation had begun to decline, and they were supplanted in general estimation by those produced in the adjoining Ager Statanus. Before it passed into the hands of the Romans, in 340 B.c., the whole district formed part of the Capuan territory. In 217 B.c. it was desolated by the Carthaginian general Maharbal.
