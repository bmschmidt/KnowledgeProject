FOSSANO, a city of Italy, iu the province of Cuneo, on the Stura, about 40 miles from Turin. It is a well-built prosperous place, with a cathedral, an academy of science and letters, a public library, a philharmonic academy, and a veterinary college. Silk and leather are manufactured, and a trade is maintained in grain and cattle. In the 11 th century Fossano was a little borough, but in the 13th it was peopled by a body of refugees and raised to considerable importance. The Astigiani family surrounded it with walls shortly afterwards; and in 1314 Filippo d’Acaia laid the foundation of the great four‰wered castle, which still forms one of its most striking features. The population in 1871 was 7272 for the town, aud 16,544 in the commune.
