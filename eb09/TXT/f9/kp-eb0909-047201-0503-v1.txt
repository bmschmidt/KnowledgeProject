FOSS, Edward (1787-1870), a solicitor by profession, was the author of a considerable number of works on legal antiquities, the most important of which are his Judges of England, in 9 vols., and his Biographia Juridica, a Biographical Dictionary of English Judges. The accuracy and extensive research of the author have made these— especially the larger work—of great historical authority.
