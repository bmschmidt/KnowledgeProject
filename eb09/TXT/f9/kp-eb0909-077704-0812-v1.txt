FREYTAG, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich (1788-1861), Arabist, was born at Lüneburg on the 19th of September 1788. After the usual preliminary training he entered the university of Göttingen as a student of philology and theology. From 1811 to 1813 he acted as repetent or theological tutor there, but in the latter year he accepted an appointment as sub-librarian, at Königsberg, unable, it is said, any longer to witness the subjection of Hanover to the French. In 1815 he became a chaplain in the Prussian army, and in that capacity visited Paris, where he had ample opportunities for the cultivation of his favourite Oriental studies. On the proclamation of peace he resigned his chaplaincy, but with the sanction and support of his Government continued his researches in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish at Paris, under De Sacy. In 1819 he was appointed to the professorship of Oriental languages in the recently established university of Bonn; and this post he continued to hold until his death, which took place on the 16th of November 1861. Besides publishing a compendium of Hebrew grammar {Kurzgefasste Grammatik der Hebräischen Sprache, 1835), and a treatise on Arabic versification {Darstellung der Arabischen Verskunst, 1838), he edited two volumes of Arabic songs {Hamasce Carmina, 1828-52) and three of Arabic proverbs {Arabum Proverbia, 1838-43). But his principal work was the laborious and praiseworthy Lexicon Arabico-Latinum (1830-37), which rapidly superseded the earlier lexicons, and which, though not to be compared with the magnificent torso of Lape, is likely to remain long in current use as embodying the best results of the labours of De Sacy and his school. An abridgment of the larger work was published in 1837.
