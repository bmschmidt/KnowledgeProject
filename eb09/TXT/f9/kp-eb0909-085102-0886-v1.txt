FÜRSTENWALDE, a town in the Prussian province of Brandenburg, government of Frankfort, on the right bank of the Spree, and on the railway between Berlin and Frankfort-on-the-Oder, 28 miles E. of the former city. Its beautiful cathedral church contains a good many old monuments. The town possesses manufactures of linen and woollen goods, breweries, meal-mills, tile-works, and a chemical work. Fürstenwalde is one of the oldest towns of Brandenburg. Since 1385 it was the seat of the bishop of Lebus, whose bishopric was incorporated with the duchy of Brunswick in 1595. The town was taken by the Swedes in 1631, and burned by the imperialists in 1633. The population in 1875 was 9688.
