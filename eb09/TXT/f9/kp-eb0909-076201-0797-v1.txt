FREEWILL BAPTISTS, a denomination of Baptists in the United States and Canada, holding similar doctrines to those of the General Baptists of England. Founded in 1780 by Benjamin Randall, a Baptist preacher, who had been censured for teaching anti-Calvinistic doctrines, it soon made considerable progress, and in 1827 a general conference, meeting every three years, was instituted. Besides erecting numerous schools of different grades, the Freewill Baptists have established three colleges, one at Lewiston, Me., one at Ridgeville, Md., and a third at Hilsdale, Mich., to which both sexes, and coloured people as well as whites, are admitted. A fourth college is being erected at Rio Grande, Ohio. In 1877 the denomination had 1464 churches in the United States, with 1295 preachers, and 74,651 communicants. In Nova Scotia and New Brunswick there is a separate conference, the membership connected with which is upwards of 9000.
