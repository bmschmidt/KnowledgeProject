FONDI, the ancient Fundi, a town of Italy in the province of Caserta, about 11 miles N.W. of Gaeta. Its principal street lies along the Appian way, and portions of its old polygonal or Cyclopean walls are still in good preservation. The castle, now in a sadly dilapidated condition, is of interest for its connexion with the Colonna family, and the Dominican convent contains a chapel which was occupied as a cell by Thomas Aquinas, and an orange-tree said to have been planted by the saint. The church of Santa Maria is a building in the Italian Gothic style, much disfigured in the interior. Between the town and the sea lies the Lago de Fondi or Locus Amyclanus, in the midst of a marshy tract which has recently been greatly diminished by draining; and near this is a cave, where, according to Tacitus, Sejanus saved the life of Tiberius. The district was in ancient times famous for its wine, including the Ager Caecubus, which gave its name to the Caecuban of the Latin poets. Population in 1871, 6632.

Fundi was probably at first a Volscian town. Its citizens were rewarded in 190 B.c. with full Roman citizenship, and enrolled in the Aemilian tribe. Under Augustus it received a colony of veterans. In the time of the barbarian invasions it suffered severely, more especially from the Saracens-in 845. The election of the anti-pope Clement VII. took place in the town in 1378, andin 1534 it was attacked and plundered by the Turkish corsair Barbarossa, who was anxious to capture the beautiful countess Giulia Gonzaga as a present for the sultan.
