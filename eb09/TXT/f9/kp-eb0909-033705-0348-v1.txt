FLORIAN, the patron saint of Poland, was born at Zeiselmauer, Lower Austria, about the year 190. He served as a captain in the Roman army, and suffered death by drowning about the year 230, during the persecution of the Christians by the emperor Diocletian. His remains are said to have been buried on the site of the present Augustinian monastery at St Florian near Linz, but were afterwards transferred to Rome. About 1183 a portion of them was presented to King Casimir of Poland, and from that time Florian became the patron saint of that country. He is represented as a warrior holding in his hand a vessel from which he pours out flames, and on this account his protection is often sought against fire. His day in the calendar is August 4.
