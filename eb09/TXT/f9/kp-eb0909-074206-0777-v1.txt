FREDERICKSHALD, or Frederickshall, a maritime town of Norway, stift of Christiania, at the junction of the Iddefjord with the Tistedals, 57 miles S.S.E. of Christiania. It has an excellent harbour, and considerable trade in tobacco, sugar, iron, and wood. A regular line of steamers connects it with Christiania. Frederickshald is noted for its strong castle of Fredericksteen, which stands on a perpendicular rock 350 feet high overhanging the sea, and is considered one of the strongest fortresses in Europe. It was at the siege of this fortress that Charles XII., king of Sweden, was killed on 11th December 1718. The town itself is not walled. Its old name was Halden, and it received the addition of Frederick from Frederick III. of Denmark and Norway after its successful defence against the Swedes in 1665. It was almost totally destroyed by fire in 1759, and has since been rebuilt in a neat and regular manner. The castle surrendered to the Swedish crownprince Bernadotte in 1814, and its capture was speedily followed by the conquest of the kingdom and its union with Sweden. The population in 1875 was 9956.
