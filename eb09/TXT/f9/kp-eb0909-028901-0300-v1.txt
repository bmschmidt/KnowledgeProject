FLAMINIUS, Caius, son of the preceding, was quaestor under P. Scipio Africanus the elder in Spain in the year 210 B.c., and took part in the capture of New Carthage. Fourteen years later he was curule aedile; and this term of office was marked by the distribution among the citizens at very low prices of large quantities of grain, which in a time of Roman scarcity the Sicilians had sent in grateful remembrance of his father’s praetorship thirty years before. In 193 B.c. he himself attained a praetorship, and was sent to the recently constituted province of Hispania Citerior. There he carried on the war against the insubordinate populations, and after a siege took Litabrum, a city which is described by Livy as having been strong and opulent, and made prisoner Corribilo, a powerful chieftain. In 187 B.c. he became consul along with Μ. Aemilius Lepidus, and was successful in giving peace to Northern Italy by the subjugation of the warlike Ligurian tribes. In the same year the branch of the Via AEmilia (traces of which are still discernible) connecting Bononia (Bologna) with Arretium (Arezzo) was constructed by him.
