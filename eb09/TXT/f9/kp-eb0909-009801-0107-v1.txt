From its situation on a rocky height it commands a splendid prospect of the surrounding country, including a fine view of the Adriatic Sea. It is surrounded by old walls, and besides the cathedral possesses numerous churches and convent3, a university, and two fine collections of statuary and paintings. The ruins of the ancient Roman town, which was destroyed in the 5th century, are still to be seen, [9:9:99] Lactantius and Galeazzo Sforza were born in Fermo. The port, Porto di Fermo, is situated on the Adriatic, about four miles from the town. The harbour is small, but there is some trade in corn, silk, and woollens. The population of Fermo in 1871 was 7002.
