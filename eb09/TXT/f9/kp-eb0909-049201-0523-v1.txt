FOWLER, Charles (1792-1867), architect, was born at Collumpton, Devon, May 17, 1792. After serving an apprenticeship of five years at Exeter, he went to London in 1814, and entered the office of David Laing, where he remained till he commenced practice for himself. His first work of importance was the Court of Bankruptcy in Basinghall Street, finished in 1821. Although he gained in the following year the first premium for a design for the new London bridge, a design by another architect was ultimately agreed upon and carried out. Among Fowler’s other designs for bridges is that for the one constructed across the Dart at Totness. He was also the architect for the markets of Covent Garden and Hungerford, the new market at Gravesend, and Exeter lower market; and besides several churches he designed Devon lunatic asylum (1845), the London fever hospital (1849), and the hall of the Wax Chandlers’ Company, Gresham Street (1853). For some years he was honorary secretary of the institute of British architects, and he was afterwards created vice-president. He retired from his profession in 1853, and died at Great Marlow, Bucks, September 26, 1867.
