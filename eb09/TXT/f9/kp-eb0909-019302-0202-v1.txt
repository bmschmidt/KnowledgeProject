FINCK, Heinrich, a celebrated German musical composer, of whose life little more is known than that he was of Saxon origin, and that between 1492 and 1506 he was chapelmaster to two successive kings of Poland, at whose court in Warsaw he resided. After this he seems to have retired to Wittenberg in Saxony, where he died. The year of his death, like that of his birth, is uncertain. His works, mostly part songs and other vocal compositions, show great musical knowledge, and amongst the early masters of the German school he holds a high position. They are found scattered amongst ancient and modern collections of songs and other musical pieces. The library of Zwickau possesses a work containing a collection of fifty-five songs by Finck, printed about the middle of the 16th century.
