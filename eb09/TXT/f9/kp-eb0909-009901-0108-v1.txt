FERMOY, a market-town of Ireland, in the East Riding of the county of Cork, is about 21 miles distant from Cork, and about 130 miles from Dublin, and is connected with both these cities by the Fermoy branch of the Great Southern and Western Railway. It is situated on the river Blackwater, which divides the town into two parts, the larger of which is on the southern bank, and there the trade of the town, which is chiefly in flour and agricultural produce, is mainly carried on. A stone bridge of 13 arches which formerly spanned the river, and which had been erected in 1689, was in the year 1866 removed, and replaced by one of strong cut stone. The town, which strikes the visitor as being exceedingly neat and clean, has several good streets, and some noteworthy buildings. Of the latter, the most prominent are the military barracks on the north bank of the river, capable of accommodating 3000 men, the Protestant Episcopal church, the Roman Catholic cathedral, St Colmanâ€™s Roman Catholic college, the convents, and the court-house. Quarter sessions are held in the town, and the muncipal affairs are managed by fifteen commissioners, who meet every alternate Wednesday. The market day is Saturday. The population in 1871 numbered 7388, 78 per cent, being Roman Catholics.
