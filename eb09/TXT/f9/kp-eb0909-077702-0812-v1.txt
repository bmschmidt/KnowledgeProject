FREYA, in Teutonic mythology, one of the Vanen, or spirits of the breathing wind, which have their abode in Vansheim, or middle air between the upper and under world. Freya, or Fregga, becomes the wife of Odur or Woden (Odin), and the mother of Jörd, the earth, thus answering to the Greek Demeter. In the myth of Thor, whose hammer is stolen by the giant Thoym, Freya lends her feather-garment to Loki, and thus enables him to go in search of it. Thoym refuses to give it up, unless Freya will consent to be his wife; and as Freya will not go, Thor, on the advice of the Heimdall, descends to Jötunheim in the disguise of a bride, and Thoym, taking the god to be Freya, meets his doom at his hands at the moment of his fancied nuptials.
