RUTLAND a township and village of the United States, capital of Rutland county, Vermont, 117 miles north-north-west of Boston. It is an important railway junction, being the terminus of several minor lines and the seat of machine-shops and engine-houses; but its name is even better known through its quarries of white marble. The population of the township was 12,149 and that of the village 7502 in 1880.

Chartered by New Hampshire in 1761 and again chartered as Socialborough in 1772 by New York, Rutland became in 1775 a fortified post on the great northern military road, and in 1781 was made the chief town of Rutland county. Between 1784 and 1804 it was one of the capitals of the State.
