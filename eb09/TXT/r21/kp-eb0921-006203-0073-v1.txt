RUSH. Under the name of rush or rushes, the stalks or fistular stem like leaves of several plants have minor industrial applications. The common rushes (species of Jutixus) are used in many parts of the world for chair-bottoms, mats, and basket work, and the pith they contain serves as wicks in open oil-lamps and for tallow-candles,—whence rushlight. The bulrush, Typha elephan-tiηa, is used in Sindh for mats and baskets. Under the name of rushes, species of Scirpus and other Gyperaceae are used for chair-bottoms, mats, and thatch. The elegant rush mats of Madras are made from Papyrus pαngorei. The sweet rush, yielding essential oil, is Andropogon Scluxnanthux, known also as lemon grass. Large quantities of the “horse tail,” Eguisetum hiemαle, are used under the name of the Dutch or scouring rush, for scouring metal and other hard surfaces on account of the large proportion of silica the plant contains.
