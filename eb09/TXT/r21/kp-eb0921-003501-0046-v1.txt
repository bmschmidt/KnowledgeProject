ROY William {c. 1726-1790), a famous geodesist, was employed in some of the great national trigonometrical measurements which were made during last century. In 1746, at the age of twenty, when an assistant in the office of Colonel Watson, deputy quartermaster-general in North Britain, he began the survey of the mainland of Scotland, the results of which were embodied in what is known as the “duke of Cumberland’s map.” In 1756 he obtained a lieutenancy in the 51st regiment, and proceeded with it to Germany, where his talents as a military draughtsman brought him to notice, and procured him rapid promotion. He ultimately reached the rank of major-general. In 1784, while deputy quartermaster-general at the Horse Guards, his services were called into request for conducting the observations for determining the relative positions of the French and English royal observatories. His measurement of a base line for that purpose on Hounslow Heath in 1784, which was destined to be the germ of all subsequent surveys of the Unitçd Kingdom, gained him the gold medal of the Royal Society of London. Owing to unforeseen delays, the triangulation for connecting the meridians of the two observatories was not carried out until 1787. He had completed his undertaking, and λvas finishing an account of it for the Phil. Trans, when he died in 1790.

Besides several papers in Phil. Trans., Roy was author of the work entitled Military Antiquities of the Romans in North Britain, published in 1793.
