ROUM (Rum) is the name by which the Arabs call the Romans, ix., all subjects of the Roman power. Bildd al-Rdm, “the lands of the Romans,” accordingly means the Roman empire. The parts of the old empire conquered by the Arabs were regarded as having ceased to be Roman, but the Western Christian lands were still called lands of the Rι'ιm, without reference to the fact that they had in great part ceased to pay any allegiance to the “king of the Rιim,” t,β., the Byzantine emperor. "When Ibn Jobair takes a passage in a Genoese vessel he speaks of the crew as Romans; and in Spain a “Riimiya” meant a “Christian slave-girl.” Sometimes all Europe is included in the lands of the Riim; at other times the northern nations are excluded; sometimes again the word means the Byzantine empire; and, finally, the kingdom founded by the Seljiiks, in lands won by them from Byzantium, is the kingdom of the Seljiiks of Rιim, so that Riim comes to take the restricted sense of Asia Minor. So Abulfeda uses the term. Roumelia and Roumania in like manner mean no more than the “Roman country” in a special limitation.
