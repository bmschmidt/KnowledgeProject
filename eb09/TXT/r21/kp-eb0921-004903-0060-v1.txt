RUDD or Red-Eye (Leuciscus erythrophthalmus), a fish of the family of Carps, generally spread over Europe, north and south of the Alps, also found in Asia Minor, and extremely common in suitable localities, viz., still and deep waters with muddy bottom. When adult, it is readily recognized by its deep, short body, golden-coppery tint of the whole surface, red eyes, and scarlet lower fins; the young are often confounded with those of the roach, but the pharyngeal teeth of the rudd stand in a double row, and not in a single one, as in the roach; also the first dorsal rays are inserted distinctly behind the vertical line from the root of the ventral fin. The anal rays are from thirteen to fifteen in number, and the scales in the lateral line from thirty-nine to forty-two. The rudd is a [9:21:50]fine fish, but little esteemed for food, and very rarely exceeds a length of 12 inches or a weight of 2 lb. It feeds on small freshwater animals and soft vegetable matter, and spawns in April or May. It readily crosses with the white bream, more rarely with the roach and bleak.
