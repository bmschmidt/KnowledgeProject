The town is famous as being the seat of Prince Eszterhâzy, whose castle of Kis-Marton is one of the finest palaces in Hungary. It was built by Prince Paul, palatine of Hungary, in 1683, but was improved and added to in 1805. The park, which is very large, has a fiue orangery, and several conservatories, containing many thousand varieties of exotic plants.
