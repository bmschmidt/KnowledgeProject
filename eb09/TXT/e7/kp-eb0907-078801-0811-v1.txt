EHRENBREITSTEIN, a small town in Prussia, in the circle of Coblentz, situated on the right bank of the Rhine, and connected with the town of Coblentz by a bridge of boats, is of importance as possessing a magnificent fortress erected upon a precipitous rock 401 feet above the Rhine. The castle which occupied the site of the modern building is said to have been presented in 636 by the Franconiau king Dagobert to the archbishops of Treves. It was twice taken by the French—in 1631 and 1799; and at the peace of Lunéville in 1801 they blew it up before evacuating it. At the second Peace of Paris the French paid 15,000,000 francs to the Prussian Government for its restoration, and the works begun in 1816 were completed in ten years. The town possesses a few ships, and has a wine and carrying trade. In 1875 the population, including the garrison, was 4901. See Coblentz.
