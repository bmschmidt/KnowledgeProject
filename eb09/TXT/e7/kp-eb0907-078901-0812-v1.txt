EICHHORN, Karl Friedrich (1781-1854), a son of the preceding, and a learned writer on jurisprudence, was born at Jena on the 20th November 1781. He entered the university of Gottingen in 1797. In 1805 he obtained the professorship of law at Frankfurt-on-the-Oder, holding it till 1811, when he accepted the same chair at Berlin. On the call to arms in 1813 he became a captain of horse, and he received at the end of the war the decoration of the Iron Cross. In 1817 he was offered the chair of law at Göttingen, and, preferring it to the Berlin professorship, taught at Göttingen with great success till ill health compelled him to resign in 1828. His successor in the Berlin chair having died in 1832, he again entered on its duties, but resigned it two years afterwards. In 1832 he also received au appointment in the ministry of foreign affairs, which, with his labours on many state committees and his legal researches and writings, occupied him till his death in July 1854. Eichhorn is regarded as one of the principal authorities on German constitutional law. His chief work is Deutsche Staats-und Pechtsgeschichte, 4 vols. In company first with Savigny and Göschen, and then with Rüdorf, he edited the Zeitschrift fur geschichtliche Rechtswissenschaft.

He is the author besides of Einleitung in das deutsche Privatrecht mit Einschluss des Lehnrechts and the Grundsätze des Kirchenrechts der hath, und evang. Peligionspartei in Deutschland.
