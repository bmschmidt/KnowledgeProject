EISENACH, the chief town of the Eisenach circle and of the administrative department of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, lies in a romantic district at the north-west end of the Thuringian wood. It is situated on the Hörsel, at the junction of the Thuringian and Werra railways, and 44 miles west from Weimar. In its neighbourhood is the Wartburg, where Luther on his return from the Diet of Worms was imprisoned, and where from May 1521 to March 1522 he devoted himself to the translation of the Bible. On a high rock on the south side of the town are the ruins of the castle of Mädelstein. Eisenach is the birth-place of Sebastian Bach, and he and Luther were educated at its gymnasium, then the Latin school. Among the public buildings may be mentioned the tower off St Nicholas, the castle, rebuilt in 1742, and the town-house, erected in 1641. Eisenach has a manufactory for cotton cloth, and a large woollen and several other mills. Population in 1875, 16,163.
