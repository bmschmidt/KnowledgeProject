ECCLES, a populous village of England, in the county of Lancaster, four miles west of Manchester by railway, and practically an outlying suburb of that city. The parish church of St Mary, an ancient structure, was enlarged and extensively repaired in 1863-4; and several dissenting places of worship have been built in the present century. The cotton-manufacture is extensively carried on in the immediate neighbourhood. Previous to the Reformation the monks of Whalley Abbey had a grange at what is still called Monksâ€™ Hall; and in 1864 many thousands of silver pennies of Henry III. and John of England and William I. of Scotland were discovered near the spot. Ainsworth, the author of the Latin and English dictionary so long familiar to English students, was born at Eccles in 1660; and it was at the vicarage that the Right Hon. William Huskisson expired on 15th September 1830 from injuries received at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.
