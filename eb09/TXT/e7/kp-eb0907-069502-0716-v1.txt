EGEDE, Hans (1686-1758), the first missionary of Greenland, was born in the vogtship of Senjen, in Norway, on the 31st January 1686. In his 22d year he became pastor at Waagen, in the bishopric of Drontheim, but the [9:7:696] study of the chronicles of the northmen having awakened in him the desire to visit the colony of northmen in Greenland, and to convert them to Christianity, he resigned his charge in 1717; and having, after great difficulty, obtained the sanction and help of the Danish Government in his enterprise, he set sail with three ships from Bergen on the 3d May 1721, accompanied by his wife and children. He landed on the west coast of Greenland on the 3d July, but found to his dismay that the northmen were entirely superseded by the Esquimaux, in whom he had no particular interest, and whose language he would be able to master, if at all, only after years of study. But, though compelled to endure for some years great privations, and at one time to see the result of his labours almost annihilated by the ravag√©e of small-pox, he remained resolutely at his post. He soon gained the affections of the people, and succeeded gradually in converting many of them to Christianity, and in establishing a considerable commerce with Denmark. Ill-health compelling him to return home in 1734, he was made principal of the seminary at Copenhagen, in which workers were trained for the Greenland mission; and from 1740 to 1747 he was superintendent of the mission. He died in 1758. He is the author of a book on the natural history of Greenland.
