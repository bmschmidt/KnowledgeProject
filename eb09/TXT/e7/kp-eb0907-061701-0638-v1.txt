EBERHARD, August Gottlob (1769-1845), a German poet and miscellaneous writer, was born at Belzig, near Wittenberg, in 1769, and died at Dresden on the 13th May 1845. He studied theology at Leipsic; but some stories he contributed to periodicals having proved successful, he devoted himself to literature. Among his earlier works were Ida's Blumenkorbchen (1792); List um List, oder was ein Kuss nicht vermag ; Ferdinand Werner, der arme Flötenspieler (1802); Prinz Fet Elof (1804); and ZscÄcrrioi Krall's Lehren und Thaten (1807). For a time he was associated with Becker in the editorship of his Taschenbuch and his Erholungen, for both of which he wrote numerous tales and sketches. His claim to permanent literary fame, however, depends almost exclusively on b⅛ Hannchen und die Küchlein Ç1822), a charmingly graceful narrative poem in ten parts, which has passed through many editions, and been translated into most of the languages of Europe. An English translation by James Cochrane was published in 1854. In his Der Erste Mensch und die Erde (1828), a poem written in hexameters, the narrative of the creation is given with dignity and spirit. After the death of Vater in 1826, Eberhard succeeded to the editorship of the Jahrbuch der häuslichen Andacht, a well-known German educational annual. The miscellaneous poems (Vermischte Gedichte) of Eberhard appeared in two volumes in 1833, and his collected works (Gesammelten Schriften) in 20 volumes in 1830-1.
