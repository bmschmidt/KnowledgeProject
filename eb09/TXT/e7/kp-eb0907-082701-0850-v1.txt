ELCHE, a town of Spain, iu the province of Alicante, six miles from the sea, on the river Vinalapo. It has three churches, as many monastic buildings, a hospital, barracks, and an old episcopal palace; but there is nothing of architectural interest except perhaps the portico of Santa Maria. The costume and physiognomy of the inhabitants, the narrow streets and flat-roofed white-washed houses, and more than all the thousands of palm-trees in its gardens and fields, give the place a strikingly Oriental aspect, and render it unique among the cities of Spain. The cultivation of the palm is indeed the principal occupation; and though the dates are inferior to those of Barbary, the annual value of the crop is about £14,000. The blanched fronds are also sold in large quantities for the processions of Palm-Sunday; and after they have received the blessing of the priest, they are regarded throughout Spain as certain defences against lightning.

Elche is identified with the ancient Ilici or Illici of the Contestani, which under the Romans obtained the rank of a colony with the jus Italicum. In 1332 it was attacked by the Moors of Granada, who discharged against it “iron balls through fire.” Population 18,734.
