EDENTATA, an order of placental mammals characterized by the total absence of median incisor teeth. Such teeth as are found in edentate species are composed entirely of dentine and cement, without enamel; they likewise grow for an indefinite period, and are consequently without root; and so far as yet discovered there is no displacement of the first teeth by any second set except in a few of the armadilloes. This order contains the sloths, armadilloes, and ant-eaters.
