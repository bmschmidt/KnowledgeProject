EDFU, in Coptish Atbo, from the old Egyptian Tebu, a village of Upper Egypt, in the province of Said, situated about a third of a mile from the left bank of the Nile, 55 miles below the cataracts of Syene, in 24° 58' 43'' N. lat. It is inhabited by about 2000 Arabs and Copts, engaged for the most part in the manufacture of earthenware, which finds ready sale all through Egypt, and is remarkable for the similarity it retains to the ancient pottery represented on the monuments. To the Egyptologist the spot is of extreme interest, as furnishing the most perfect specimen of an ancient Egyptian temple, full details iu regard to which may be found in the article Architecture, vol. ii. p. 389. By the Greeks and Romans the city to which this splendid building belonged was known as Apollinopolis Magna, the god to whom the temple was dedicated being identified with the Greek Apollo. Under the later empire it was the see of a bishop and the head-quarters of the Legio II. Trajana.
