EASEMENT, in English law, is a species of servitude or limited right of use over land belonging to another. It is distinguished from a profit, which is a right to take the soil of another, while an easement is a right to use the soil or the produce of the soil in a way tending to the more convenient enjoyment of another piece of land. Thus a right of way is an easement, a right of common is a profit. Besides rights of way the most important easements are water-courses (as where a person has a right to divert a flow of water), the right to discharge water, &c., upon a neighbourâ€™s land, and the right to restrain such a use of land as would obstruct the access of light and air to an ancient window.
