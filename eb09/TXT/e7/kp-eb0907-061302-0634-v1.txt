EASTBOURNE, a watering-place on the Sussex coast, 66 miles from London by railway. It is situated about three miles to the east of Beachy Head, the loftiest headland on the English Channel. It once consisted of three parts :—the old village of East Bourne, a mile inland; South Bourne, lying back from the shore; and Seahouses, facing the beach; but these distinctions are now almost obliterated, and numerous handsome terraces and detached houses have more or less united the three old hamlets into one town. Besides the parish church of St Mary’s, a building of some antiquity, there are four chapels of ease in Eastbourne. A pier was erected in 1868. The population, which is rapidly increasing, was 10,361 in 1871.
