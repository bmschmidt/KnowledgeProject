EDESSA, the ancient capital of Macedonia, previously known as Aegae, was situated 46 miles W. of Thessalonica on the banks of a beautiful stream in the very centre of the kingdom, and at the head of a defile commanding the approaches from the sea-coast to the interior of the country. It was the original residence of the Macedonian kings; and even after the seat of government was removed to the more accessible Pella, it continued to be the burial-place of the royal family. At the celebration of his daughter’s marriage in the town, Philip II. was murdered by Pausanias in 336 B.c. His greater son Alexander was buried at Memphis through the contrivance of Ptolemy; but the bodies of his granddaughter Eurydice and her husband Arrhidaeus were removed by Cassandcr to the ancestral sepulchre. On the occupation of the town by Pyrrhus the royal tombs were plundered by the Gallic mercenaries. The modern city of Vodena is built on the site of Edessa, and preserves a few unimportant remains of ancient buildings. The names Aegae and Edessa were both probably given in allusion to the full-flowing streams that form one of the principal features of the situation; and Vodena is certainly derived from the Slavonic v<κZα, water. Full details in regard to the position of the city may be found in Tozer, The Highlands of Turkey, vol. i.
