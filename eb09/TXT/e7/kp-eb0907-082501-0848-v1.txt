ELATERIUM, a drug consisting of a sediment deposited by the juice of the fruit of Ecbalium Elaterium, the squirting cucumber (see vol. vi. p. 688.) To prepare it, the fruit is sliced lengthwise and slightly pressed; the greenish and slightly turbid juice thus obtained is strained and set aside; and the deposit of elaterium formed after a few hours is collected on a linen filter, rapidly drained, and dried on porous tiles at a gentle heat. Elaterium is met with in commerce in light, thin, friable, flat or slightly incurved opaque cakes, of a greyish-green colour, bitter taste, and tea-like smell. The best kind is the English, prepared at Hitchin, Market Deeping, Mitcham, and elsewhere; the Maltese is generally very inferior. Elaterium is an exceedingly powerful hydragogue and drastic purgative, and not unfrequently produces vomiting. Its active principal is elaterin, a crystallizable body of the formula C 20 H 2s O 5 .
