CURRIE, James (1756-18C5), a Scotch physician and an editor of Burns, was the son of theminister of Kirkpatrick Fleming, in Dumfriesshire, where he was born. He was destined for business, and while still very young was sent out to Virginia. The outbreak of the first American war, however, changed his prospects considerably; he had a long and dangerous illness; and he still further damaged his chance of success by contributing a series of letters to an American journal, under the signature of “An Old Man,” in defence of the mother country. At last he found it necessary to leave America, and reaching home at the age of twenty, he applied himself with energy to the study of medicine. In 1780, with the object of procuring military service in Jamaica, he took his degree at Glasgow; but not obtaining the post he had in view, he settled at Liverpool, v here in 1783 he was elected physician to the infirmary. I he fatigues of Lis professional work, acting upon a hereditary tendency to pulmonary disease, forced him in 1804 to give up practice, and retire to the south of England, where he died in the following year. Among Currie’s works may be mentioned a Tory pamphlet signed “Jasper Wilson” and entitled A Letter, Commercial and Political, addressed to the Right Honourable 'William Pitt, which ran quickly through several editions; and Medical Reports on the Effects of Water, Cold and Warm, as a Remedy in Fevers and other Diseases. But he is best known for the edition of Burns, with an introductory criticism and an essay on the character and condition of the Scottish peasantry, which he undertook in behalf of the family of the poet, whose personal acquaintance he had enjoyed.
