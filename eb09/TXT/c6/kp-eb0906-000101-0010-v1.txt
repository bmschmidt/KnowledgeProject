CLICHY, or Clichy la Garenne, a village or township of France, in the department of Seine, situated on the right bank of the river, immediately to the north of the ramparts of Paris, of which it may almost be said to be part. It is the seat of a number of extensive industrial establishments, engaged in the manufacture of steam engines, chemical stuffs, and glass. The village is of high antiquity, and was the residence of some of the early kings of France. Its church was built in the 17th century under the direction of the famous Saint Vincent de Paul, who at that time had charge of the cure. Population in 1872, 14,599.
