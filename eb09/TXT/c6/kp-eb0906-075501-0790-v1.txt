CZERNOWITZ, or Czernauz, the capital town of the Austrian duchy of Bukowina, in 48° 26' N. lat. and 25° 57' E. long., picturesquely situated on a height above the right bank of the river Pruth, 140 miles S.Ë of Lemberg, 720 feet above the sea. The line of railway from Cracow and Lemberg to Galatz on the lower Danube passes by Czernowitz. It is a clean, pleasant town, possessing for its chief buildings a Greek cathedral, a theological seminary, and several schools; and it is the seat of an archbishop, of an Oriental Greek patriarch, and of the metropolitan of Bukowina. A fine bridge of 720 feet in length crosses the Pruth, with six spans. There are manufactures of machinery and bronze work, and a considerable trade is carried on with Moldavia and Bessarabia in grain, brandy, cattle, hides, wood, wool, and potashes. Population with suburbs (1869), 33,884.
