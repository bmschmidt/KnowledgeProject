CLITOR, a town of ancient Greece, in that part of Arcadia which corresponds to the modern eparchy of Kalavryta. It stood in a fertile plain to the south of Mount Chelmos, the highest peak of the Aroanian Mountains, and not far from a stream of its own name, which joined the Aroanius, or Katzana. In the neighbourhood was a fountain, the waters of which were said to deprive those who drunk them of the taste for wine. The town was a place of considerable importance in Arcadia, and its inhabitants w ere noted for their love of 1 iberty. It extended its territory over several neighbouring towns, and in the Theban war fought against Orchomenos. As a member of the Achaean league it suffered siege at the hands of the Aetolians, and was on several occasions the seat of the federal assemblies. The ruins, which bear the common name of Paleopoli, or Old City, are still to be seen about three miles from a village that preserves the ancient designation. The greater part of the walls and several of the circular towers with which they were strengthened can be clearly made out; and there are also remains of a small Doric temple, the columns of which were adorned with strange capitals.
