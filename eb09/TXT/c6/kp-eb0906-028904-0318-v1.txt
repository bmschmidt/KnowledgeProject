CONON, an Athenian general. Having already commanded on several occasions, he was chosen as one of the ten generals who superseded Alcibiades in 406 B.c. He was not présent ât the battle of Arginusae, and consequently he was allowed to remain in command. In 405, however, the Athenian fleet was surprised by Lysander, at Aegospotami, and Conon fled to his friend, Evagoras, king of Cyprus. On the outbreak of the war between Sparta and the Persians, he obtained from King Artaxerxes joint command with Pharnabazus of a Persian fleet. With it in 394 B.c. he defeated the Lacedaemonians near Cnidos, and thus deprived them of the empire of the sea, which they had held since the taking of Athens. Sailing down 'the AEgean to Athens, he expelled the Lacedaemonian harmosts from most of the maritime towns, and finally completed his services to his country by restoring the long walls and the fortifications of the Piraeeus. According to one account, he was put to death by Tiribazus, when on an embassy from Athens to the Persian court; but it seems more probable that he escaped to Cyprus, where he had considerable property, and that he died there a natural death. See Greece.
