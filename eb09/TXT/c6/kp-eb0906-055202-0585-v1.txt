CRANTOR, a Greek philosopher of the Old Academy, famous as the first commentator on Plato, was born, probably about the middle of the 4th century, at Soli in Cilicia, and was a fellow pupil of Polomo in the school of Xenocrates at Athens. His poems, which are said to have been deposited in the temple of Athena at Soli, have [9:6:553] entirely perished; but of his celebrated work On Grief numerous extracts have been preserved in Plutarch and in Cicero De. Consolatione.
