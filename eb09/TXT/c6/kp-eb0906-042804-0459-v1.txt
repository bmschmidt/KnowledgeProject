COROMANDEL COAST, the eastern seaboard of India between Cape Calimere, in 10° 17' N. lat. and 79° 56' E. long., and the mouths of the Kistnah or Krishnah. The shore, which is shallow, is without a single good natural harbour, and is at all times beaten by a heavy sea. Communication with ships can be effected only by catamarans and flat-bottomed surf-boats. The north-east monsoon, which lasts from October till April, is exceedingly violent for three months after its commencement. From April till October hot southerly winds blow by day; at night the heat is tempered by sea-breezes. The principal places frequented by shipping are Pulicat, Madras, Sadras, Pondicherri, Cuddalor, Tranquebar, Nagore, and Naga-patnam. The name Coromandel is said to be derived from Cholamandal, the mandal or region of the ancient dynasty of the Chola.
