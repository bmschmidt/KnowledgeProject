CRANBROOK, a town of England, in the county of Kent, six miles south of the Staplehurst station, on the South-Eastern Railway. It has a fine church dedicated to St Dunstan, which is remarkable for a baptistery in which the ceremony used to be administered by immersion. As the central town of the agricultural district called the Weald of Kent, it carries on a pretty extensive trade in malt, hops, and general goods; but its present condition is in striking contrast to the activity it displayed from the 14th to the 17th century, when it was one of the principal seats of the broadcloth manufacture. In the neighbourhood are the ruins of the old mansion house of Sissinghurst, or Saxen-lÎ¹urst, built by Sir John Baker in the time of Edward VI., and interesting as the birthplace of Sir Richard Baker the chronicler. Population of the parish in 1871, 4331.
