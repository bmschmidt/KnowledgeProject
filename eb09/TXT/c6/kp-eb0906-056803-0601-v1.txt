CRESPI, Daniele (1590-1630), an Italian historical painter, born at Milan, studied under Giovanni Battista Crespi and Procaccini. He was an excellent colourist; his drawing was correct and vigorous, and he grouped his compositions with much ability. His best work, a series of pictures front the life of Saint Bruno, is in the monastery of the Carthusians at Milan. Among the most famous of his paintings is a Stoning of St Stephen at Brera, and there are several excellent examples of his work in the city of his birth and at Pavia.
