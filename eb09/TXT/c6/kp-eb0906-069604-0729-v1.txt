CUMANA, a city of Venezuela, capital of a province of the same name, stands on the Gulf of Cariaco, at the mouth of the Manzanares, 180 miles east of Caracas. It is the oldest European city in South America, having been founded by Diego Castellon in 1523. It -was almost totally destroyed by the terrible earthquake of 1766, and has since repeatedly suffered from earthquakes. The houses are generally low and flat, and have a poor appearance; but the style of building has recently been much improved. Cumana possesses a capacious roadstead, and presents great facilities for obtaining provisions. The principal trade is in cattle, smoked meat, dried fish, coffee, cotton, sugar, tobacco, salt, and j etroleum. Population (1873), 9427.
