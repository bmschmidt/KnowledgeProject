CONDÉ, a town of France, in the department of Nord, arrondissement of Valenciennes, is situated at the confluence of the Scheldt and the Haine, and at the terminus of the Mons canal, two miles from the Belgian frontier. It contains a hôtel de ville and an arsenal, a church and a hospital. Brewing is carried on to a small extent, as well as the manufacture of oil and salt, and there is a large trade in coal. The place is of considerable antiquity, dating at least from the later Roman period. Taken in 1676 by Louis XIV., it definitely passed into the possession of France by the Treaty of Nimeguen two years later, and was afterwards fortified by Vauban. During the revolutionary war it was attacked and taken by the Austrians (1794); and in 1815 it again fell to the Allies. Condé gives its name to a distinguished branch of the Bourbon family. Population of the town in 1872, 3748; of the commune, 4964.
