CRATES, of Athens, an Athenian actor and author of comedies of the 5th century b.c. He acted in the comedies of Cratinus; and his own pieces are distinguished chiefly, first, by the fact that they did not depend for their interest upon political references, and secondly, by the fact that he introduced drunkards on the stage,â€”a class of characters that had never appeared there before, although very frequently after his time.
