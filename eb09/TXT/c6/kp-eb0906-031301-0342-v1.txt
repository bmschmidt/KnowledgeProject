CONSUEGRA, a town of Spain, on the Amarguilla, in the province of Toledo, and 36 miles south-east of the city of that name. It contains about 7000 inhabitants, principally engaged in the manufacture of coarse woollens. Roman inscriptions and other remains bear witness to the antiquity of the town, which was formerly known as Consabrum; and on a neighbouring hill are the ruins of its ancient castle.
