CORIANDER, the fruit, improperly called: seed, of an Umbelliferous plant {Coriandrum sativum), & native of tho south of Europe and Asia Minor, but naturalized and cultivated in the south of England. The plant produces a stem rising about a foot in height, with bipinnate leaves and flowers in pink or whitish umbels. The fruit is globular and externally smooth, having five indistinct ridges, and the mericarps, or half-fruits, do not readily separate from each other. It is used in medicine as an aromatic and carminative, and on account of its pleasant and pungent flavour it is a favourite ingredient in hot curries and sauces. The fruit is also used in confectionery, and as a flavouring ingredient in various liqueurs, The essential oil on which its aroma depends is obtained from it by distillation. The tender leaves and shoots of the young plant are used in soups and salads.
