CYRIL [Cyrillus], saint and bishop of Jerusalem. He was born probably at Jerusalem about 315, and died about 386. He was ordained a presbyter in 345, and had the instruction of the catechumens confided to him. In 350 he was elevated to the see of Jerusalem, and became deeply involved in the dogmatic controversies of his time. His metropolitan, Acacius of Caesarea, inclined to Arianism, while Cyril strongly espoused the Nicene creed. The result was the temporary deposition of Cyril. On the death of the emperor Constantine, however, he was restored; but again, on the accession of Valens, an Arian emperor, he had once more to resign his post till the accession of Theodosius permitted him to return finally in peace in 379. He attended the second oecumenical council held at Constantinople in 381, where he was received with grateful acclamations for his sufferings in defence of orthodoxy. Cyril has left one important work — his 23 Catecheses (Kατy^yσeις) or lectures mainly addressed to those who were preparing for baptism; the last 5, under the name of the Mystagogic Catacheses, were addressed to newly baptized persons. These lectures are said to be “the first example of a popular compend of religion,” and are particularly interesting for the insight which they give us both into the creed-forms of the early church and the various ceremonies of initiation constituting baptism in the 4th century. Other tracts and homilies have been ascribed to Cyril of Jerusalem, but they are of doubtful genuineness. The Catecheses of Cyril have been translated in the Oxford Library of the Fathers, vol ii.
