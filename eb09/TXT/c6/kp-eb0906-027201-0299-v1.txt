CONGREVE, Sir William, Bart. (1772-1828), the inventor of the Congreve rocket, was the eldest son of Sir William Congreve, Bart., of Walton in Staffordshire. He procured a commission in the artillery, became lieutenant-general, and assisted the duke of York in the changes introduced by him into the management of the army. He also obtained a seat in the House of Commons for Gatton, and afterwards for Plymouth. He wrote an Elementary Treatise on the Mounting of Naval Ordnance (1812), and a Description of the Hydro-pneumatic Lock (1815).
