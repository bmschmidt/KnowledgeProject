COLIN, Alexander (1526-1612), a Flemish sculptor, was born at Mechlin. In 1563 he went, at the invitation of the emperor Ferdinand I., to Innsbruck, to work on the magnificent monument which was being erected to Maximilian I. in the ñave of the Franciscan church. Of the twenty-four marble alti-rilievi, representing the emperor’s principal acts and victories, which adorn the sides of this tomb, twenty were executed by Colin, apparently in three years. The work displays a remarkable combination of liveliness and spirit with extreme care and finish, its delicacy rivalling that of a fine cameo. Thorwaldsen is said to have pronounced it the finest work of its kind. Colin, who was sculptor in ordinary both to the emperor and to his son, the archduke Ferdinand, did a great deal of work for his patrons at Innsbruck, and in its neighbourhood; particular mention may be made of the sepulchres of the archduke and his first wife Philippa, both in the same church as the Maximilian monument. His tomb in the cemetery at Innsbruck bears a fine bas-relief executed by himself.
