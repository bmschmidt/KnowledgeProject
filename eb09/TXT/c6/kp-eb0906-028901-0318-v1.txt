CONNEMARA, a wild and picturesque district in the west of Galway, Ireland, indented by numerous bays from the Atlantic, whence it derives its name. It corresponds in boundary with the barony of Ballinahinch, lying between the bays of Kilkieran and Ballinakill; but the name is often applied in a general way to the whole western division of county Galway.
