CUXHAVEN, or Kuxhafen, a small seaport-town of Northern Germany, at the mouth of the Elbe, on its left bank, 58 miles W.N.W. of Hamburg, in the detached bailiwick of Ritzeb√ºttel, which forms part of the territory belonging to Hamburg. It has nearly 3900 inhabitants, chiefly pilots and fishermen. The harbour is good aud secure, and is much frequented by vessels delayed in the Elbe by unfavourable weather; it is also the starting point of the Hamburg steamers when the river is frozen over. There is regular communication by diligence with Bremerhafen, and by river with Hamburg. Though lying on a bare strand, the town is much frequented as a bathingplace by Hamburgers.
