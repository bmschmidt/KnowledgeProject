CRIEFF, a town in Perthshire, Scotland, on the north bank of the Earn, seventeen miles west of Perth by rail. It is situated on an acclivity rising from the river, which is here crossed by a bridge. It consists of a main street with narrower streets branching off at right angles, and contains several churches, an endowed academy for boys, an industrial institution, and a mechanicsâ€™ institute. The town is comparatively modem, but an ancient sculptured stone still stands in the High Street and also the old town cross. Crieff owes its growth mainly to the central position it occupies in the district of upper Strathearn, which is noted for its beauty and salubrity. Strathearn House, a large hydropathic establishment on the slope of a hill above the town, attracts many visitors. Population in 1871, 4027.
