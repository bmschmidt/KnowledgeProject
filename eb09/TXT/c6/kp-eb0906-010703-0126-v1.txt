CODRUS, the hero of an early Athenian legend, was the last king of Athens, and belongs to the 11 th century B.c. According to the story, it was prophesied that the Dorians would conquer Attica if they spared the life of the Attic king. Devoting himself to his country, Codrus, in disguise, provoked a quarrel with some Dorian soldiers. He fell, and the Dorians retreated homeward. To so noble a patriot no one was thought worthy to succeed; and the title of king was thenceforth abolished, that of archon taking its place.
