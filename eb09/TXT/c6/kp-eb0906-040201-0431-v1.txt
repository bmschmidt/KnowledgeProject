CORIOLI, an ancient Latin city, celebrated as giving a surname to C. Marcius Coriolanus. It is first mentioned in Roman story as falling into the hands of the Volsci, and being retaken from them by the Romans, 493 B.c. It was never a large or important place, and seems to have dropped out of existence before the close of the 5th century b.c. The site of Corioli is now unknown. Nibbey and Cell have quite conjecturally assigned it to the hill called Monte Giove, about nineteen miles from Rome on the way to Antium, while others, with as little ground, have suggested a hill four miles nearer Antium.
