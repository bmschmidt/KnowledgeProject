CORONELLI, Vincenzio (1650-1718), an Italian geographer, was born at Venice. Having by his skill in mathematics become known to the Count d’Estrées, Coronelli was employed by the count to make globes for Louis XIV. In 1685 he was appointed cosmographer to the republic of Venice, and four years afterwards public professor of geography. He founded an academy of cosmography at Venice, and died in that city in 1718. He published about 400 geographical charts, an abridgement of cosmography, several books on geography, and other works. See Tiraboschi, Litteratura ltaliana.
