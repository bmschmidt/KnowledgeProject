COLLINS, Mortimer (1827-1876), novelist and writer of lyrics, was born at Plymouth, and was educated at a private school. After some years spent in tuition and some contributions in verse to the Bristol newspapers, he repaired to London, and devoted himself to journalism in the Conservative interest. In 1855 he published a volume of verse; and in 1865 appeared his first story, Who is the Heir 1 A second volume of lyrics, The Inn of Strange Meetings, was issued in 1871; and in 1872 he produced his longest and best sustained poem, The British Birds, a communication from the Ghost of Aristophanes. He wrote profusely for journals and magazines—the Owl, the Globe, Punch, Temple Bar, Belgravia, the World, <fcc.—and produced, besides, several novels, the most readable of which, perhaps, is Sweet Anne Page (1868). As novels merely, these works are not greatly to be commended; as the work of a clever man of pronounced opinions, they arc often interesting[9:6:148] enough. Their author’s great claim to remembrance, however, is based upon his lyrics; some of these, in their light grace, their sparkling wit, their airy philosophy, are equal to anything of their kind in modern English.
