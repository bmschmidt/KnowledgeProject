It has a superb church, and a convent dedicated to St Domingo, from which it takes the more precise designation of San Domingo Comitan. The inhabitants derive their subsistence in great measure from agriculture; but they also carry on a smuggling trade with Belize and Guatemala. Population about 10,000.
