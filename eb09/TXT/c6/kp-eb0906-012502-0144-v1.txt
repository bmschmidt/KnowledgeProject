COLDSTREAM, a town of Scotland, in Berwickshire, 15 miles west of Berwick, on the north bank of the Tweed, there crossed by a bridge of five arches. It is situated on the principal thoroughfare between England and Scotland, and in the neighbourhood of the ford by which the Scotch and English armies were wont to cross the river in olden times. In the period before the Reformation it was the seat of a priory famous in history as the place where the Papal legate, in the reign of Henry VIII., published a bull against the printing of the Scriptures; and in the present century, by a curious irony of fate, the very site of the building was occupied by an establishment under Dr Adam Thomson for the production of Bibles at a low rate. Coldstream, like Gretna Green, was formerly celebrated for its irregular marriages. The regiment of Foot Guards known as the “Coldstream Guards” was so named from General Monk having set out with it from the town on his march into England in 1659. Population in 1871, 2619.
