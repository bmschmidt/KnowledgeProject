CURTIUS, Quintus Rufus, the celebrated biographer of Alexander the Great. Of his personal history nothing whatever is known with certainty, some fixing his epoch in the Augustan, others as far down as the mediaeval age, but most critics in the time of Vespasian. Niebuhr held him to be a contemporary of Septimius" Severus. His work originally consisted of ten books, but the first two of these are entirely lost, and the remaining eight are incomplete. The best modern editions of the text are those of Zumρt, Baumstark, and Mützell.
