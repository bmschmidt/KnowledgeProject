COTA, Rodrigo, a Spanish poet of the 15th century, said to have been born at Toledo. Nothing is known of his life or death, saving that he was poor and of humble rank. To him is attributed the popular Copias de Mingo Revulgo, an anonymous pastoral satire against Henry IV. of Castile, which has been often edited and often imitated, and which is unquestionably one of the first attempts at dramatic poetry in Spanish literature. To him, too, is sometimes ascribed the authorship of a similar piece, the Dialogo entre el amor y un viejo. Besides these, he is supposed to have written the first act of the celebrated novel-drama, the Celestino. (1480), which was finished in twenty-one acts by Fernando de Rojas. For an account of the influence of the Celestino on the Castilian drama, and of the numerous editions, imitations, and translations of it, see Ticknor, History of Spanish Literature, vol. i. pp. 235â€”244.
