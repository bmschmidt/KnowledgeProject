CONSTANTIUS, Flavius Valerius, commonly called Constantius Chlorus, or the Pale (an epithet first applied by the Byzantine historians, though with doubtful accuracy, for there is evidence to show that ho was, like his son, ruddy), Roman emperor and father of Constantine tho Great, Î»vas born of noble Dalmatian family about 250 a.d. Having distinguished himself by his military ability and his able and gentle rule of Dalmatia, he was, in March 292, adopted and appointed Caesar by Maximian, whose daughter Theodosia he was obliged to many after renouncing his wife Helena. By Helena he became the father of Constantine. He obtained the title Augustus in 305, and died the following year. See Roman History.
