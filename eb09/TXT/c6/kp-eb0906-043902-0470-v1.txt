CORBY, a city of 6800 inhabitants, in Erie County, Pennsylvania, which owes its existence and its prosperity to the petroleum wells discovered in 1861. Besides the numerous establishments, connected with the oil-trade, it has engineering works, steam-mills, and tanneries; and, favoured as it is by its position at a railway junction, it is rapidly developing a considerable traffic. Its incorpora√≠ion as a city dates from 1866.
