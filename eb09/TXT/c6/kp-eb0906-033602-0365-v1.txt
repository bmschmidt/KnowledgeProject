COOPER, Abraham (1787-1868), an animal and battle painter, was the son of a tobacconist, and was born in London, in 1787. At the age of thirteen he became an employe at Astley’s amphitheatre, and was afterwards groom in the service of Sir Henry Meux. When he was twenty-two, wishing to possess a portrait of a favourite horse under his care, he bought a manual of painting, learned something of the use of oil colours, and painted the picture on a canvas hung against the stable wall. His master bought it and encouraged him to continue in his efforts. He accordingly began to copy prints of horses, and was introduced by Davis, the equestrian, to Benjamin Marshall, the animal painter, who took him into his studio, and seems to have introduced him to the Sporting Magazine, an illustrated periodical to which he was himself a contributor. In 1814 he exhibited his Tam O’Shanter, and in 1816 he won a prize of £100 for his Battle of Ligny. In 1817 he exhibited his Battle of Marston Moor and was made Associate of the Academy, and in 1820 he was elected Academician. He died in 1868. Cooper although ill educated, was a clever and conscientious artist; his colouring was somewhat flat and dead, but he was a skilful draughtsman and a master of equine portraiture and anatomy, and had some antiquarian knowledge. He had a special fondness for Cavalier and Roundhead work, and his best pictures are those in which he has reproduced the subjects of that period.
