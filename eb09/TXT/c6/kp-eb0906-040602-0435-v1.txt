CORLEONE, a town of Sicily, in the province of Palermo, about 23 miles south of the city of that name, on the slope of a hill near the head waters of the Belici. It is well built and has two castles, one in ruins and the other used as a prison, and several good churches, of which the chief was restored in 1392. The town was one of the Saracen settlements in Sicily, and the castles are believed to be of Saracen erection; the inhabitants are principally descendants of a Lombard colony, introduced in 1227 by Frederick IL, and traces of the Lombard dialect are still observable. A fair trade is carried on with Palermo. The population, including the suburb of S. Niccolo, exceeds 16,000.
