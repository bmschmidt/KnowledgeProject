COYSEVOX, Antoine (1640-1670), one of the most able and famous of French sculptors, born at -Lyons in 1640, belonged to a family which had emigrated from Spain. He was only seventeen when he produced a statue of the Madonna of considerable merit; and having studied under Leranbert, and trained himself by taking copies in marble from the Greek masterpieces (among others from the Venus de Medici and the Castor and Pollux), he was engaged by the bishop of Strasburg, prince and cardinal Fürstenberg, to adorn with statuary the palace of Saverne. After four years spent on this work, he returned to Paris in 1671, having gained very considerable fame. He was now employed by Louis XIV. in producing a large number of statues for Versailles; and he afterwards worked with no less facility and success for the palace at Marly. His works are far too numerous to mention; but among them are the Mercury and Fame, placed first at Marly and afterwards in the. gardens of the Tuileries: [9:6:538] Neptune and Amphitrite, in the gardens at Marly; Justice and Force, at Versailles; and statues, in which the likenesses are .said to have been remarkably successful, of most of the celebrated men of his age, including Louis XIV., Louis XV., Colbert (at Saint-Eustache), Mazarin (in the church des Quatre-Nations), Condé the Great, Maria Theresa of Austria, Luvois, Turenne, Vauban, Cardinals de Bouillon and de Polignac, Fénelon, Racine, Bossuet, Comte d’Harcourt, Prince de Fürstenberg, and Charles Lebrun.
