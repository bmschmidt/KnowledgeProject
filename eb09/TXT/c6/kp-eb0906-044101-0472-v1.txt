CORT, Cornelius (1536-1578), was born at Horn in Holland, and studied engraving under Jerom Cockx of Antwerp. About 1565 he went to Venice, where Titian employed him to execute the well-known copper-plates of St Jerome in the Desert, the Magdalen, Prometheus, Diana and Actaeon, and Diana and Calisto. From Italy he wandered back to the Netherlands, but he returned to Venice soon after 1567, proceeding thence to Bologna and Rome, where he produced engravings from all the great masters of the time. At Rome he founded the well-known school in which, as Bartsch tells us, the simple line of Marcantonio was modified by a brilliant touch of the burin, afterwards imitated and perfected by Agostino Caracci in Italy and Nicolas de Bruyn in the Netherlands. Before visiting the Peninsula, Cort had been content to copy Coxcie, F. Floris, Hemskerk, Mostaert, Spranger, and Stradin. In Italy he gave circulation to the works of Raphael, Titian, Polidoro da Caravaggio, Baroccio, Giulio Clovio, Muziano, and the Zuccari. His connection with Jerom Cockx and Titian is pleasantly illustrated in a letter addressed to the latter by Dominick Lampson of Li√®ge in 1567. Cort is said to have engraved upwards of 151 plates.
