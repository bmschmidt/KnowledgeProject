CRUSENSTOLPE, Magnus Jakob, a Swedish historian, was born in 1795. He became early famous both as a political and an historical writer. His first important work was a History of the Early Years of the Life of King Gustavus IV. Adolphus, which was followed by a series of monographs and by some politico-historical novels, of which The House of Holstein-Gottorp in Sweden is considered the best. He obtained a great personal influence over King Karl Johan, who during the years 1830-33 gave him his fullest confidence, and sanctioned the official character of Crusenstolpe’s newspaper Fädemeslandet. In the last-mentioned year, however, the historian suddenly became the king’s bitterest enemy, and used his acrid pen on all occasions in attacking him. In 1838 he was condemned, for one of these angry utterances, to be imprisoned three years in the castle of Waxholm. He continued his literary labours until his death in 1865. Few Swedish writers have wielded so pure and so incisive a style as Crusenstolpe, and it is by virtue of the elegance of his writings that he will survive, for his historical worth is injured by the passionate bias of his political and personal antipathies.
