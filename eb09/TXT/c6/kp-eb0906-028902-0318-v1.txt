CONNOR, Bernard (1666-1698), physician, was born in Kerry, Ireland. He studied medicine at Montpellier, and afterwards at Paris. Having travelled through Italy with the two sons of the high chancellor of Poland, he was introduced at the court of Warsaw, and appointed physician to John Sobieski, king of Poland. In 1695 he visited England, and read a course of lectures on physiology in London and Oxford. He was afterwards elected member of the Royal Society and College of Physicians, and was invited to Cambridge, where he also delivered public lectures. He was the author of a treatise entitled Evan· gelium Medici (the Physician’s Gospel), in which he endeavoured to explain the Christian miracles as due to natural causes. He also wrote a History of Poland in 2 vols.
