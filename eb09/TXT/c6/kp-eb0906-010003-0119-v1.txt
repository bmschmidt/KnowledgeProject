COCLES, Horatius, a Roman hero, who, with Spurius Lartius and Titus Herminius as sole companions, defended the Sublician bridge against Lars Porsena and the whole army of the Etruscans. While the three heroes kept back the enemy the Romans cut down the bridge behind. When it was almost ready to fall his comrades retreated, but Horatius waited till the work was complete, and Rome was saved. Then, despite the arrows of the enemy, he swam in safety to the opposite shore. A statue was erected in his honour, and he received as much land as he could plough round in a single day. According to another story, Horatius was alone in his heroism, and gave his life for his country. The former version is adopted by Lord Macaulay in his Lays of Ancient Borne.
