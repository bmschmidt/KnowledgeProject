CSOKONAI, M1haly Vitez (1773-1805), an Hungarian poet, was born at Debrecsin in 1773. Having been educated in his native town, he was appointed while still very young to the professorship of poetry there; but soon after he was deprived of the post on account of the immorality of his conduct. The remaining twelve years of his short life were passed in almost constant wretchedness, and he died in his native town, and in his motherâ€™s house, when only thirty-one years of age. Csokonai was the author of a mock-heroic poem called Dorottya, two or three comedies or farces, and a number of love-poems. Most of his works have been published, with a life, by Schedel (1844-4-7).
