JOHN VI. (1769-1826) of Portugal was born at Lisbon May 13, 1769, and received the title of prince of Brazil in 1788. In 1792 he assumed the reins of government in name of his mother Queen Mary I., who had become insane. He himself having been brought up in an unhealthy ecclesiastical atmosphere, and being naturally of a somewhat weak and helpless character, was but ill adapted for the responsibilities he was thus called on to undertake. In 1799 he assumed the title of regent, which he retained until his motherâ€™s death in 1816. The political relations of Portugal with England and France from the period of the first coalition against France in 1793 to the treaty of Fontainebleau (1807), by which the partition of the first-named country was agreed upon, will be elsewhere explained (see Portugal). In consequence of the latter treaty the prince of Brazil found it necessary to leave the kingdom (November 1807), and transfer the seat of his government to Rio Janeiro. The occupation and annexation of the whole country immediately ensued; against this he recorded his protest in November 1808, and in a more practical manner by the seizure of French Guiana in ,the following year. He also entered into alliance with England in 1810, and was a party to the treaty of Paris in 1814. In 1816 he was recognized as king of Portugal on the death of Mary, but he continued to reside abroad; the consequence was the spread of a feeling of natural dissatisfaction, which resulted in the peaceful revolution of 1820, and the proclamation of a constitutional government, to which he swore fidelity on his return to Portugal in 1822. In the same year, and again in 1823, he had to suppress a rebellion led by his son Dorn Miguel, whom he ultimately was compelled to banish in 1824. He died at Lisbon, March 26, 1826, and was succeeded by Pedro IV.
