JURA, an island of the inner Hebrides, on the west coast of Argyllshire, Scotland, the fourth largest of the group, is situated between 55° 52' and 56° 9' N. lat., and 5° 43' and 6° 8' W. long. On the north it is separated from the island of Scarba by the whirlpool of Corryvreckan, on the east from the mainland by Jura Sound, which is 10 miles broad, and on the south and southwest from Islay by Islay Sound. The area is about 160 square miles, the greatest length about 27 miles, and the breadth about 6. A chain of rugged hills, rising into eminences called the Paps of Jura, the highest summit of which is 2500 feet, traverses the whole extent of the island, interrupted only by Tarbert Loch, an arm of the sea, which forms an indentation into the island of nearly 6 miles, and almost cuts it in two. Jura derived its name, meaning “deer island,” from the red deer which abounded on it. On the pasturage a considerable number of black cattle are raised; and some corn and potatoes are cultivated along the eastern shore. Fishing is prosecuted to a small extent. The population, which in 1851 was 1064, was 781 in 1881.
