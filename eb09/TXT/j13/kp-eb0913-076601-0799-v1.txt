JUDSON, Adoniram (1788-1850), was born at Malden, Massachusetts, August 9, 1788. During his education at Andover theological seminary he formed the resolution to become a missionary, and in 1812 he was ordained a missionary to Burmah under the auspices of the Congregational Board of Foreign Missions. Having after his arrival in India adopted Baptist views, he was appointed to labour in Burmah by the American Baptist Missionary Union in 1814. His translations of the Bible into Burmese appeared in 1835, and his Burmese and English Dictionary in 1852. He died April 12, 1850. Both in his literary and his missionary labours he was greatly assisted by the three ladies whom he successively married, of whom as well as of Judson biographies have been published.
