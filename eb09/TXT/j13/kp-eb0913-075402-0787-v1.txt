JOST, Isaak Markus (1793-1860), historical writer, was born on February 22, 1793, at Bernburg, and studied at the gymnasium of Wolfenbüttel, whence he passed successively to the universities of Göttingen and Berlin. In Berlin he taught a school from 1826 till 1835, when he received the appointment of upper master in the Jewish commercial school (called the Philanthropin) at Frankfort-on-the-Main. Here he remained until his death, 20th November 1860. The work by which he is chiefly known is a Geschichte der Israeliten, in 9 vols. (Berlin, 1820- 29), which was afterwards supplemented by Neuere Geschichte der Israeliten von 1815-45 (Berlin, 1846-47), and Geschichte des Judenthums u. seiner Sekten (Leipsic, 1857-59). He also published an abridgment of the Geschichte under the title Allgemeine Geschichte des jüdischen Volks (1831-32), and an edition of the Mishna with a German translation and notes (in 6 vols., 1832- 34). The Israelitische Annalen were edited by him from 1839 to 1841, and he contributed extensively on pedagogic and historical subjects to scientific journals.
