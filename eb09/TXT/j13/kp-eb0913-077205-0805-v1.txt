JUMILLA, a town of Spain, in the province of Murcia, is situated 37 miles north-north-west of Murcia, at the foot of a hill whose summit is crowned by a citadel. The streets are regular, clean, and well-paved, and there are three squares. Jumilla possesses two parish churches of some architectural merit, the church of Santiago in the Corinthian [9:13:773] style being adorned with paintings of Rubens and other artists of fame, and with some beautiful frescoes. There is also a Franciscan convent and a hospital. The town is chiefly dependent on agriculture, but has corn and oil mills, brick-kilns, and manufactories of salt, coarse cloth, soap, and firearms. The population in 1877 was 13,886.
