JOHN II. (1455-1495), “the Perfect,” king of Portugal, succeeded his father, Alphonso V., in August 1481. His first business after ascending the throne was to curtail with a vigorous hand the overgrown power of his aristocracy; noteworthy incidents in the contest were the execution (in 1483) of the duke of Braganza for correspondence with [9:13:715] Castile, and the murder, by the king’s own hand, of the youthful duke of Viseu for conspiracy. This reign was signalized by Bartolommeo Dias’s discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1486, and also by the equipment (1493) of a squadron for exploration of the new world recently discovered by Columbus. The latter proceeding led to disputes with Castile, until the claims of the disputants were adjusted by the famous treaty of Tordesillas (7th June 1494). John II. died, without leaving male issue, in October 1495, and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Emmanuel (Manoel) I.
