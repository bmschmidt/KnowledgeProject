JANSSEN, or Jansen (sometimes Johnson), Cornelius (1590-1665), painter, was bornât Amsterdam about 1590. About 1618 he went to England, where he was patronized by James I. and the court. Under Charles I. he continued to paint the numerous portraits which adorn very many of the mansions and collections of England; but in 1648, after the outbreak of civil war, he retired to Holland, where his brush was busy till his death in 1665. Janssen’s pictures, chiefly portraits, are distinguished by clear [9:13:568] colouring, delicate touch, good taste, and careful finish. He generally painted upon panel, and often worked on a small scale, sometimes producing replicas of his larger works. A characteristic of his style is the very dark background, which throws the carnations of his portraits into rounded relief.
