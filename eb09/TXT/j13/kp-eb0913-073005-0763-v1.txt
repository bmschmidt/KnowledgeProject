JOHORE, a native state at the southern end of the Malay or Malacca peninsula, bounded by the Moar river on the N.W. and by the Indu on the N.E., with an area estimated at 20,000 square miles. The territory, covered for the most part by virgin forest, has been but partially explored; but it is gradually being opened up under the patronage of the rajah Abubaker (born 5th December 1833), who has visited Europe, as well as Java and other eastern countries, and takes a keen interest in the development of his country. At present the principal [9:13:731] exports from Johore are gambier and catechu, black pepper, timber, rattans, and dammar; but the soil and climate are well fitted for the growth of sugar-cane, rice, tobacco, coffee, and similar products, and the rajah is promoting the formation of regular plantations. The town of Johore is a flourishing little settlement 15 miles north-east of Singapore, in 1° 0'26"N. lat. and 103° 47'E. long. A school where English is taught has been founded in the town by the rajah, who also maintains a similar institution in Singapore. The population of the country, exclusive of the tribes of the interior, is estimated at 100,000, the greater number being Malays and Chinese. It was the present rajah’s grandfather—Abdulrahman Tumongong of Rio, Singapore, and Johore—who ceded Singapore to the British. The dynasty is the continuation of the sultans of Malacca, who retired to Johore on the conquest of their capital in 1311 by Albuquerque. Bokhari, author of Makota Raja Raja, one of the most remarkable productions in the Malay tongue, was a native of Johore.
