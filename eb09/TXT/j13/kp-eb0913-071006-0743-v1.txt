JOHN VII. (pope from 705 to 707), successor of John VI., was also of Greek nationality. He declined to accede to the request of the emperor Justinian II. that he should give his sanction to the decrees of the Quinisext or Trullan council of 691, on the ground that a papal legate was not present, and his death shortly afterwards delivered, him from the necessity of committing himself to a more decided opinion. He was followed by Sisinnius.
