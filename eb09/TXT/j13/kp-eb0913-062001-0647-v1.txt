JEM MAPES, or Jemappes, a village in the arrondissement and 3 miles west of the town of Mons, in the province of Hainault, Belgium, is situated on the Haine, near the “Bassin du Flenu,” one of the richest coal-fields in the province. It has manufactures of mining gear, salt, soap, brass, and leather. The population of the commune in 1876 was 10,816.

Jemmapes is famous as the scene of a sanguinary battle fought November 6, 1792, between the French under f)umouriez and the Austrians under the duke of Saxe-Teschen, in which the latter were defeated. The French gained temporary possession of Belgium, and Jemmapes gave its name to a French department, comprising most of Hainault.
