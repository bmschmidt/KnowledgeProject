JOHN II. (pope from 532 to 535), surnamed on account of his eloquence Mercurius, was elevated to the papal chair on the death of Boniface II. During his pontificate a decree against simony was engraven on marble and placed before the altar of St Peterâ€™s. At the instance of the emperor Justinian he adopted the proposition unus de Trinitate passus est in came as a test of the orthodoxy of certain Scythian monks accused of Nestorian tendencies. He was succeeded by Agapetus I.
