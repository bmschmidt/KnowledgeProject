JAGÁDHRI, a municipal town in Ambâlâ district, Punjab, India, is situated in 30° 10' N. lat. and 77° 20' 45" E. long., a little west of the river Jumna, 37 miles south-east of Ambâlâ city, and 3 miles north of the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway. Before the Sikh invasions, Jagâdhri was a mere village; but Râi Sinh of Bûria, the Sikh conqueror, encouraged the commercial and manufacturing classes to settle on the spot, so that a considerable trade rapidly sprang up. Destroyed by Nâdir Shâh during one of his incursions, but rebuilt in 1783 by RM Sinh, it passed to the British in 1829 together with the territory of which it was the capital. Jagâdhri has imports of copper and iron, considerable manufacture of metal work, and exports of vessels and tools. It contains a tahsili, police-office, and rest-house. The population in 1868 was 11,676, comprising 9220 Hindus, 2319 Mahometans, and 137 Sikhs.
