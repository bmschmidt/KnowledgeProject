JOHN VII. (1390-1448), Palaeologus, emperor of Constantinople, son of Manuel II., was born in 1390, and in 1425 succeeded to the semblance of dominion and the wreck of the empire. To secure the favour of the Latins he consented to the union of the Greek and Roman Churches, which was ratified at Florence in 1439. The union failed of its purpose, but by his prudent conduct towards the Ottomans he succeeded in holding possession of Constantinople till his death in 1448.
