JESSE, John Heneage (1808-1874), son of Edward Jesse noticed above, was born in 1808. From his early manhood he held an office in the secretary’s department of the Admiralty at Whitehall. His first contribution to literature, a poem on Mary Queen of Scots, which he dedicated to Sir Walter Scott, was published in 1829, and this was followed in 1830 by a collection of poems entitled Tales of the Dead. Among his other efforts in verse were a drama {Richard III.) and a fragmentary poem entitled London, dedicated to Mr Rogers the poet. None of these ventures achieved any success, but his series of historical works, which together form a continuous narrative from the reign of Richard III. to that of George III. inclusive, are written with vivacity and interest, and in their own style are a not unimportant contribution to the history of England. His Memoirs of the Court of England during the Reign of the Stuarts was published in 1839-40, Memoirs of the Court of London from the Revohιtion oj 1688 to the Death of George II. in 1843, George Selwyn and his Contemporaries in 1844, Memoirs of the Pretenders and their Adherents in 1845, Richard the Third and his Contemporaries in 1861, and Memoirs of the Life and Reign of King George the Third in 1867. The titles of these works are sufficiently indicative of their character. They are sketches of the principal personages and of the social details of various periods in the history of England rather than complete and comprehensive historical narratives. In addition to these works, Mr Jesse wrote Literary and Historical Memoirs of London, 1847., and London and its Celebrities, 1871. His Memoirs of Celebrated Etonians appeared in 1875. He died July 7, 1874.
