JOHN V. (pope from 686 to 687) was a Syrian by birth, and on account of his knowledge of Greek had in 680 been named papal legate to the sixth oecumenical council at Constantinople. He was the successor of Benedict II., and after a pontificate of little more than a year, passed chiefly in bed, was followed by Conon.
