JOHN III. (1502-1557) of Portugal was born at Lisbon, June 6, 1502, and ascended the throne as successor of his father Emmanuel L in December 1521. In 1524 he married Catherine, sister to the emperor Charles V., who in turn shortly afterwards married the infanta Isabella, Johnâ€™s sister. Succeeding to the crown at a time when Portugal was at the height of its political power, and Lisbon in a position of commercial importance previously unknown, John III., unfortunately for his dominions, yielded so far to the counsels of the clerical party among his subjects as to consent to the introduction of the Inquisition (about 1526); this led to measures of tyranny and oppression which, notwithstanding the enactment of many wise laws, soon avenged themselves in disastrous consequences to the commercial and social prosperity of his kingdom. The conflicts in which Portugal engaged with the Moors and the Turks during his reign were comparatively unfruitful of results. He died of apoplexy on June 6, 1557, and was succeeded by his grandson Sebastian, then a child of only three years.
