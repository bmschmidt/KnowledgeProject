JOSEPH, the husband of Mary the mother of Jesus, was a descendant of the house of David, and followed the trade of a carpenter in the village of Nazareth. Of his personal history practically nothing is recorded in Scripture. It is probable that he had died before the beginning of the public ministry of Christ; at least this seems a fair inference from the fact that no mention of him is made in passages relating to this period where the mother and brethren of Jesus are introduced. From John xix. 26 it is clear [9:13:750] that he was not alive at the time of the crucifixion. Ecclesiastical tradition, probably influenced by dogmatic prepossessions, has it that when married to Mary he was already eighty years of age and the father of four sons and two daughters, and that his first wife was named Salome, a connexion of the family of John the Baptist. In the Roman Catholic Church the 19th of March has since 1642 been a feast of obligation in his honour. His cultus is on the increase.
