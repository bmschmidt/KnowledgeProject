JOHN II. (1088-1143), Comnenus, surnamed Kalo-joÎ±nnes (John the Good), was the eldest son of the emperor Alexius, whom he succeeded on the throne in 1118. On account of his mild and just reign he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius, but he displayed little vigour in the internal administration of his kingdom or in extirpating the governmental corruptions and abuses he had inherited. Nor did his various successes against the Hungarians, Servians, and Turks, though they won him the high admiration of his soldiers, add much to the stability of his kingdom. He was accidentally killed during a wildboar hunt on Mount Taurus, 8th April 1143.
