JÜLICH (Fr., Juliers) i the chief town of a circle in the government district of Aachen, Prussia, and capital of the former duchy of Jülich, situated on the right bank of the Roer, about 16 miles north-east of Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle). It contains three churches, a progymnasium, and a military school, and has manufactures of leather, paper, and wood. The population in 1875 was 5111.

Jülich (formerly also Giilch, Gιιliche) is the Juliacum of the Antonini Itinerarium ; some have attributed its origin to Julius Caesar. From the 9th century it appears several times in history, generally as the scene of siege. From 1794 till 1815 it was in the hands of the French. Till 1860, when its works were demolished, Jülich ranked as a fortress of the second class.
