JOHN XIV. (pope from 984 to 985), successor to Benedict VII., was born at Pavia, and before his elevation to the papal chair was imperial chancellor of Otho II. Otho died shortly after his election, and, taking advantage of the opportunity, Boniface VII., on the strength of the popular feeling against the new pope, returned from Constantinople and placed John in prison, where he died either by starvation or poison.
