JOHN (JUAN) I. (1350-1395), king of Aragon, was born December 27, 1350, and succeeded his father, Pedro IV., in 1387. He left the affairs of his kingdom to a large extent in the hands of his wife Yolande, a granddaughter of John the Good, king of France, while he himself led a life of pleasure and inglorious ease. A characteristic feature of his reign was the encouragement he gave to the poetical institutions of the troubadours, a “consistory of the Gaya Sciencia” having been founded at Barcelona under his auspices iu 1390. In that year he repelled an attack by the count of Armagnac, who had laid claim to the domains in Majorca previously in possession of his family; and in 1392 he quelled a revolt of the Sardinians.

He died in 1395, in consequence of an accident on the hunting field, and was succeeded by his brother Martin.
