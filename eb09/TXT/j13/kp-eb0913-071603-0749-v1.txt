JOHN II. (1404-1454) of Castile and Leon, grandson of the preceding, succeeded to the throne when only twenty-two months old. Until 1412 the regency was shared with his mother Catherine by his uncle Ferdinand (afterwards Ferdinand IV. of Aragon); this period was marked by much internal prosperity and by important conquests from the Moors, especially by the capture of Antequera. Unfortunately for Castile, Ferdinand was called away (in 1412) to occupy the throne of Aragon; but it was not until after the death of Catherine in 1418 that John’s weakness and incapacity came to be fully seen. Abandoning himself recklessly to a life of frivolous pleasure, he left the affairs of his kingdom in the hands of a few favourites, such as the archbishop of Toledo and Juan de Velasco. From 1423 onwards he was the tool principally of Alvaro de Luna, a brilliant, ambitious, and crafty courtier. Henceforward the history of his reign is largely a record of the internal commotions, rising sometimes to the height of civil war, occasioned by the nobles’ jealousy of Alvaro, and by the oppressions to which the common people were exposed under the absolutist policy of that minister. The period of John II. is chiefly and most favourably remembered in connexion with the history of Castilian literature: a man of some literary turn himself, he was a liberal patron of letters; and his countenance gave an impulse to refinement and culture of literary style, the effects of which were distinctly traceable through several subsequent generations. By his first wife John II. became the father of Henry IV., his successor; the daughter of a second marriage was Isabella, afterwards known as “the Catholic.” He died in June 1454.
